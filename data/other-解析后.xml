<item><title>12 healthy snacks with 200 calories or less</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000724.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>Snacks are small, quick mini-meals. Snacks are eaten between meals and help keep you full. Including a protein-source with your snack (such as nuts, beans, or low-fat or fat-free dairy) or a whole-grain can help to give snacks more "staying power" so you will not get hungry again as soon. Healthy snacks are:</text><detail>Whole grain</detail><detail>Low-salt</detail><detail>Low in added sugar</detail><detail>Fresh foods like fruits and vegetables </detail></h2><h2 title="Snacks List"><text>Here are a dozen health snack ideas you can try:</text><detail>One medium apple or pear with 12 almonds</detail><detail>Half cup (120 milliliters, mL) of berries with 6 ounces (oz), or 170 grams (g), of plain yogurt or low-fat cottage cheese</detail><detail>One small banana with 1 tablespoon (tbsp), or (15 mL), unsalted peanut butter or almond butter</detail><detail>One quarter cup (62 mL) trail mix with dried fruits and nuts (with no added sugar or salt)</detail><detail>Three cups (720 mL) air popped popcorn with 2 tbsp (30 mL) shredded parmesan cheese</detail><detail>One cup (240 mL) of grapes or cherry tomatoes with a low-fat string cheese</detail><detail>One cup (240 mL) raw carrots, broccoli, or bell peppers with 2 tbsp (30 mL) of hummus or black bean dip</detail><detail>One cup (240 mL) tomato soup with five whole grain crackers</detail><detail>One third cup (80 mL) rolled oats cooked in 1 cup (240 mL) fat-free milk with cinnamon</detail><detail>A hard-boiled egg and 12 almonds</detail><detail>Fruit smoothie with 1 cup (240 mL) fat-free milk, half a small banana, and half cup (120 g) berries</detail><detail>Five whole wheat crackers and 1 oz (28 g) low-fat cheddar </detail></h2><h2 title="Why Snacks can be Good for you"><text>Snacks are good for you, as long as you include healthy choices and snack mindfully. (For example, put the desired amount if food on a plate rather than eating directly from the bag.) Small snacks between meals can keep you from overeating at mealtimes and help you manage your weight.</text><text>Healthy snacks for adults can provide energy for work and exercise. Healthy snacks and drinks for children provide much needed energy for growth, school, and sports. Offer young children healthy snacks, and they may be more likely to choose them on their own when they get older. Avoid snacks with added sugar to help you maintain healthy teeth.</text><text>Eating a variety of snacks like the ones above will give you extra vitamins, minerals, fiber, antioxidants (substances that help prevent cell damage), and other disease-fighting nutrients. Choosing low-calorie snacks can help you or your child maintain a healthy weight.</text><text>Limit high-calorie sports drinks and packaged, processed snacks, likes chips or cookies. Include a glass of water with your snack instead of a sweetened beverage.</text><text>If you have diabetes, you may need to pay attention to the number of carbohydrates in your snacks, as well.</text></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>Nibbles; Appetizers; Healthy eating - healthy snacks; Weight loss - healthy snacks; Healthy diet - healthy snacks; Wellness - healthy snacks</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 4/23/2018"><text>Updated by: Emily Wax, RD, The Brooklyn Hospital Center, Brooklyn, NY.

<item><title>10 ways to cut 500 calories a day</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000892.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>No matter what type of diet you follow, to lose weight, you need to burn more calories than you take in each day. For most overweight people, cutting about 500 calories a day is a good place to start. If you can eat 500 fewer calories every day, you should lose about a pound (450 g) a week.</text><text>Always talk with your health care provider to determine a healthy weight for you before starting a weight-loss diet.</text></h2><h2 title="How to Cut Calories"><text>Try these 10 ways to cut 500 calories every day. It is easier than you may think.</text><detail>Swap your snack. Many people reach for a snack or two in between meals. Snacking is fine, just be sure to choose lower-calorie options. The key is to have some healthy snacks ready when hunger hits. Instead of a 3-ounce (85 g) bag of flavored tortilla chips (425 calories), choose a cup (250 mg) of air-popped popcorn (31 calories), a cup (250 mg) of grapes and a low-fat cheese stick (180 calories) or a small apple and 12 almonds (160 calories). Choosing healthy snacks twice a day will save you 500 calories.</detail><detail>Cut one high-calorie treat. Try to nix one high-calorie food item each day. Whether it is a donut in the morning, a brownie or bag of chips at lunch, or chocolate cake after dinner, you will save 250 to 350 calories or more. To burn another 150 calories take a 40-minute brisk walk after lunch or dinner.</detail><detail>DO NOT drink your calories. One 12-ounce (355 mL) regular soda has about 150 calories, and a 16-ounce (475 mL) flavored latte can pack 250 or more. Even fruit smoothies have lots of calories, as many as 400 in a 16-ounce (475 mL) serving. A couple of sweet drinks a day can easily add up to 500 calories or more. Choose water, sparkling water, or black coffee or tea instead and save your calories for foods that will help you feel full.</detail><detail>Skip seconds. Taking a second helping can add up to unwanted calories. It is easy to keep filling your plate when you serve food family style on the table. Instead, fill your plate once and keep extras in the kitchen. Or, if you still do not feel satisfied, add a second helping of vegetables, fruit, or salad.</detail><detail>Make low calorie substitutions. Substitute lower-calorie options for some of your high-calorie favorites. For example, if a recipe calls for a cup (250 mL) of sour cream (444 calories), use plain low-fat yogurt or Greek yogurt instead (154 calories).</detail><detail>Ask for a doggie bag. The portions at most restaurants are much larger than recommended serving sizes. Instead of cleaning your whole plate, ask the server to put half in a container for you to take home for another meal. You can also share an entiré with a friend, or make a meal out of an appetizer and a large salad. Just be sure to go easy on the dressing and fried toppings.</detail><detail>Just say "no" to fried food. Frying food adds lots of unhealthy calories and saturated fat to any dish. Instead of fried chicken or fish, choose grilled, broiled, or poached instead. And skip the French fries. A large serving of fries alone can add almost 500 calories to a meal. Instead, see if you can substitute for the vegetable of the day or a side salad.</detail><detail>Build a thinner pizza. Skip the meat toppings, extra cheese, and deep-dish crust, and have a couple slices of thin-crust vegetable pizza instead. You will save a little over 500 calories.</detail><detail>Use a plate. Eat all food from a plate or bowl, including snacks. When you snack out of a bag or box, it is easy to eat more than you intend to. This is especially true if you are sitting in front of the TV. You may be surprised to learn that a large bag of chips will run more than 1000 calories. Instead, place one portion in a bowl, and put the rest away.</detail><detail>Avoid alcohol. Cutting back on alcohol is an easy way for many people to trim calories. Alcohol does not have any nutritional value, so when you imbibe (drink) alcohol, you are getting empty calories, up to 500 for some mixed drinks made with syrupy sweeteners, fruit juices, and ice cream or heavy cream. If you do order a drink, choose a 12-ounce (355 mL) light beer (103 calories) or a 5-ounce (145 mL) glass of wine (120 calories). </detail></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>Weight loss - 500 calories; Overweight - 500 calories; Obesity - 500 calories; Diet - 500 calories</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 4/23/2018"><text>Updated by: Emily Wax, RD, The Brooklyn Hospital Center, Brooklyn, NY.

<item><title>Your diet after gastric bypass surgery</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000173.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>You had gastric bypass surgery. This surgery made your stomach smaller by closing off most of your stomach with staples. It changed the way your body handles the food you eat. You will eat less food, and your body will not absorb all the calories from the food you eat.</text><text>Your health care provider will teach you about foods you can eat and foods you should avoid. It is very important to follow these diet guidelines.</text></h2><h2 title="When you go Home From the Hospital"><text>You will eat only liquid or puréed food for 2 or 3 weeks after the surgery. You will slowly add in soft foods, then regular food.</text><detail>When you start eating solid foods again, you will feel full very quickly at first. Just a few bites of solid food will fill you up. This is because your new stomach pouch holds only a tablespoonful of food at first, about the size of a walnut.</detail><detail>Your pouch will get slightly larger over time. You DO NOT want to stretch it out, so DO NOT eat more than your provider recommends. When your pouch is larger, it will not hold more than about 1 cup (250 milliliter) of chewed food. A normal stomach can hold up to 4 cups (1 liter, L) of chewed food. </detail><text>You will lose weight quickly over the first 3 to 6 months. During this time, you may: </text><detail>Have body aches</detail><detail>Feel tired and cold</detail><detail>Have dry skin</detail><detail>Have mood changes</detail><detail>Have hair loss or thinning hair </detail><text>These symptoms are normal. They should go away as you take in more protein and calories as your body gets used to your weight loss.</text></h2><h2 title="A new way of Eating"><text>Remember to eat slowly and chew each bite very slowly and completely. DO NOT swallow food until it is smooth. The opening between your new stomach pouch and your intestines is very small. Food that is not chewed well can block this opening.</text><detail>Take at least 20 to 30 minutes to eat a meal. If you vomit or have pain under your breastbone during or after eating, you may be eating too fast.</detail><detail>Eat 6 small meals throughout the day instead of 3 big meals. DO NOT snack between meals.</detail><detail>STOP EATING AS SOON AS YOU ARE FULL. </detail><text>Some foods you eat may cause some pain or discomfort if you do not chew them completely. Some of these are pasta, rice, bread, raw vegetables, and meats. Adding a low-fat sauce, broth, or gravy can make them easier to digest. Other foods that may cause discomfort are dry foods, such as popcorn and nuts, or fibrous foods, such as celery and corn.</text><text>You will need to drink up to 8 cups (2 L) of water or other calorie-free liquids every day. Follow these guidelines for drinking:</text><detail>DO NOT drink anything for 30 minutes after you eat food. Also, DO NOT drink anything while you are eating. The liquid will fill you up. This may keep you from eating enough healthy food. It can also lubricate food and make it easy for you to eat more than you should.</detail><detail>Take small sips when you are drinking. DO NOT gulp.</detail><detail>Ask your provider before using a straw, since it may bring air in your stomach. </detail></h2><h2 title="Follow Your Diet Carefully"><text>You will need to make sure you are getting enough protein, vitamins, and minerals while you are losing weight quickly. Eating mostly protein, fruits, vegetables, and whole grains will help your body get the nutrients it needs.</text><text>Protein may be the most important of these foods early after surgery. Your body needs protein to build muscles and other body tissues, and to heal well after surgery. Low-fat protein choices include: </text><detail>Skinless chicken</detail><detail>Lean beef or pork</detail><detail>Fish</detail><detail>Whole eggs or egg whites</detail><detail>Beans</detail><detail>Dairy products, which includes low-fat or nonfat hard cheeses, cottage cheese, milk, and yogurt. </detail><text>After gastric bypass surgery, your body will not absorb some important vitamins and minerals. You will need to take these vitamins and minerals for the rest of your life:</text><detail>Multivitamin with iron</detail><detail>Vitamin B12</detail><detail>Calcium (1200 mg per day) and vitamin D. Your body can absorb only about 500 mg of calcium at a time. Divide your calcium into 2 or 3 doses during the day. Calcium must be taken in the "citrate" form. </detail><text>You may need to take other supplements also.</text><text>You will need to have regular checkups with your provider to keep track of your weight and to make sure you are eating well. These visits are a good time to talk with your provider about any problems you are having with your diet, or about other issues related to your surgery and recovery.</text></h2><h2 title="Calories Still Count"><text>Avoid foods that are high in calories. It is important to get all of the nutrition you need without eating too many calories.</text><detail>DO NOT eat foods that have a lot of fats, sugar, or carbohydrates.</detail><detail>DO NOT drink much alcohol. Alcohol has a lot of calories, but it does not provide nutrition.</detail><detail>DO NOT drink fluids that have a lot of calories. Avoid drinks that have sugar, fructose, or corn syrup in them.</detail><detail>Avoid carbonated drinks (drinks with bubbles), or let them go flat before drinking. </detail><text>Portions and serving sizes still count. Your dietitian or nutritionist can give you suggested serving sizes of the foods in your diet.</text><text>If you gain weight after gastric bypass surgery, ask yourself:</text><detail>Am I eating too many high-calorie foods or drinks?</detail><detail>Am I getting enough protein?</detail><detail>Am I eating too often?</detail><detail>Am I exercising enough? </detail></h2><h2 title="When to Contact a Medical Professional"><text>Call your provider if:</text><detail>You are gaining weight or you stop losing weight.</detail><detail>You are vomiting after eating.</detail><detail>You have diarrhea most days.</detail><detail>You feel tired all the time.</detail><detail>You have dizziness or are sweating. </detail></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>Gastric bypass surgery - your diet; Obesity - diet after bypass; Weight loss - diet after bypass</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 6/27/2016"><text>Updated by: Ann Rogers, MD, Associate Professor of Surgery; Director, Penn State Surgical Weight Loss Program, Penn State Milton S.

<item><title>Wrist sprain - aftercare</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000568.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>A sprain is an injury to the ligaments around a joint. Ligaments are strong, flexible fibers that hold bones together.</text><text>When you sprain your wrist, you have pulled or torn one or more of the ligaments in your wrist joint. This can happen from landing on your hand wrong when you fall.</text><text>See a health care provider as soon as possible after your injury.</text></h2><h2 title="More About Your Injury"><text>Wrist sprains can be mild to severe. They are ranked by how severely the ligament is pulled or torn away from the bone. </text><detail>Grade 1 -- Ligaments are stretched too far, but not torn. This is a mild injury.</detail><detail>Grade 2 -- Ligaments are partially torn. This is a moderate injury and may require splinting or casting to stabilize the joint.</detail><detail>Grade 3 -- Ligaments are completely torn. This is a severe injury and usually requires medical or surgical care. </detail><text>Chronic wrist sprains from poorly treated ligament injuries in the past can lead to weakening of the bones and ligaments in the wrist. If not treated, this can lead to arthritis. </text></h2><h2 title="What to Expect"><text>Symptoms such as pain, swelling, bruising and loss of strength or stability are common with mild (grade 1) to moderate (grade 2) wrist sprains. </text><text>With mild injuries, stiffness is normal once the ligament begins to heal. This can improve with light stretching. </text><text>Severe (grade 3) wrist sprains may need to be looked at by a hand surgeon. X-rays or an MRI of the wrist may need to be done. More severe injuries may require surgery. </text><text>Chronic sprains should be treated with splinting, pain medicine, and anti-inflammatory medicine. Chronic sprains may need steroid injections and possibly surgery. </text></h2><h2 title="Symptom Relief"><text>Follow any specific instructions for symptom relief. You may be advised that for the first few days or weeks after your injury: </text><detail>Rest. Stop any activity that causes pain. You may need a splint. You can find wrist splints at your local drugstore.</detail><detail>Ice your wrist for about 20 minutes, 2 to 3 times a day. To prevent skin injury, wrap the ice pack in a clean cloth before applying. </detail><text>Make sure to rest your wrist as much as you can. Use a compression wrap or splint to keep the wrist from moving and to keep the swelling down.</text><text>For pain, you can use ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn), or acetaminophen (Tylenol). You can buy these pain medicines at the store. </text><detail>Talk with your provider before using these medicines if you have heart disease, high blood pressure, kidney disease, or have had stomach ulcers or internal bleeding in the past.</detail><detail>DO NOT take more than the amount recommended on the bottle or by your provider.</detail><detail>DO NOT give aspirin to children. </detail></h2><h2 title="Activity"><text>To build strength once your wrist starts to feel better, try the ball drill. </text><detail>With your palm up, place a rubber ball in your hand and grab it with your fingers.</detail><detail>Keep your hand and wrist still while you gently squeeze the ball.</detail><detail>Squeeze for about 30 seconds, then release.</detail><detail>Repeat this 20 times, twice a day. </detail><text>To increase flexibility and movement: </text><detail>Warm up your wrist by using a heating pad or warm washcloth for about 10 minutes.</detail><detail>Once your wrist is warm, hold your hand out flat and grab your fingers with the uninjured hand. Gently bring the fingers back to bend the wrist. Stop just before it begins to feel uncomfortable. Hold the stretch for 30 seconds.</detail><detail>Take a minute to let your wrist relax. Repeat the stretch 5 times.</detail><detail>Bend your wrist in the opposite direction, stretching downward and holding for 30 seconds. Relax your wrist for a minute, and repeat this stretch 5 times, as well. </detail><text>If you feel increased discomfort in your wrist after these exercises, ice the wrist for 20 minutes.</text><text>Do the exercises twice a day.</text></h2><h2 title="Follow-up"><text>Follow up with your provider 1 to 2 weeks after your injury. Based on the severity of your injury, your provider may want to see you more than once. </text><text>For chronic wrist sprains, talk to your provider about what activity may be causing you to re-injure your wrist and what you can do to prevent further injury. </text></h2><h2 title="When to Call the Doctor"><text>Call the provider if you have: </text><detail>Sudden numbness or tingling</detail><detail>A sudden increase in pain or swelling</detail><detail>Sudden bruising or locking in the wrist</detail><detail>An injury that does not seem to be healing as expected </detail></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>Scapholunate ligament sprain - aftercare</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 4/15/2018"><text>Updated by: Linda J.

NICU stands for neonatal intensive care unit. While there, your baby will receive special medical care. Learn what to expect when you visit your baby in the NICU.</text></h2><h2 title="What is a NICU?"><text>The NICU is a special unit in the hospital for babies born preterm, very early, or who have some other serious medical condition. Most babies born very early will need special care after birth.</text><text>Your delivery may have taken place in a hospital that has a NICU. If not, you and your baby may have been moved to a hospital with a NICU to receive special care.</text></h2><h2 title="Very Early Babies Look Different "><text>When babies are born early, they have not yet finished growing. So, they will not look like a baby that was carried a full 9 months.</text><detail>A preterm infant will be smaller and will weigh less than a full-term infant.</detail><detail>The baby may have thin, smooth, shiny skin that you can see through.</detail><detail>The skin may look red because you can see blood in the vessels underneath. </detail><text>Other things you may notice:</text><detail>Body hair (lanugo)</detail><detail>Less body fat</detail><detail>Floppy muscles and less movement </detail></h2><h2 title="What to Expect in the NICU"><text>Your baby will be put in an enclosed, see-through plastic crib called an incubator.

<item><title>Uterine artery embolization - discharge </title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000161.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>You had uterine artery embolization (UAE). UAE is a procedure to treat fibroids using radiology instead of surgery. During the procedure, the blood supply of the fibroids was blocked. This caused them to shrink. The procedure took about 1 to 3 hours.</text><text>You were given a sedative and local pain medicine (anesthetic). An interventional radiologist made a 1/4-inch (0.64 centimeters)-long cut in your skin over your groin. A catheter (a thin tube) was put into the femoral artery at the top of your leg. The radiologist then threaded the catheter into the artery that supplies blood to your uterus (uterine artery).</text><text>Small plastic or gelatin particles were injected into the blood vessels that carry blood to the fibroids. These particles block the blood supply to the fibroids. Without this blood supply, the fibroids will shrink and then die.</text></h2><h2 title="What to Expect at Home"><text>You may have a low-grade fever and symptoms for about a week after the procedure. A small bruise where the catheter was inserted is also normal. You may also have moderate to strong cramping pain for 1 to 2 weeks after the procedure. Your health care provider will give you a prescription for pain medicine.</text><text>Most women need 1 to 2 weeks to recover after UAE before returning to work. It may take 2 to 3 months for your fibroids to shrink enough for symptoms to decrease and your menstrual cycle return to normal. The fibroids may continue to shrink during the next year.</text></h2><h2 title="Self-care "><text>Take it easy when you return home.</text><detail>Move around slowly, only for brief periods when you first get home.</detail><detail>Avoid strenuous activity like housework, yard work, and lifting children for at least 2 days.

<item><title>Types of ileostomy</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000073.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>You had an injury or disease in your digestive system and needed an operation called an ileostomy. The operation changed the way your body gets rid of waste (stool, feces, or poop).</text><text>Now you have an opening called a stoma in your belly. Waste will pass through the stoma into a pouch that collects it. You will need to take care of the stoma and empty the pouch many times a day.</text></h2><h2 title="What to Expect at Home"><text>Stool that comes from your ileostomy is thin or thick liquid. It is not solid like the stool that came from your rectum. You must take care of the skin around the stoma.</text><text>You can still do normal activities, such as traveling, playing sports, swimming, doing things with your family, and working. You will learn how to take care of your stoma and pouch as part of your daily routine. Your ileostomy will not shorten your life.</text></h2><h2 title="What Does an Ileostomy Do? "><text>An ileostomy is a surgically made opening on the skin of the belly. An ileostomy replaces the rectum as the place where waste of the digestive system (stool) leaves the body.</text><text>Most often the colon (large intestine) absorbs most of the water that you eat and drink. With an ileostomy in place, the colon is no longer being used. This means that the stool from your ileostomy has far more liquid than a typical bowel movement from the rectum.</text><text>The stool now comes out from the ileostomy and empties into a pouch that is attached to the skin around your stoma. The pouch is made to fit your body well. You must wear it all the time.</text><text>The waste that collects will be liquid or pasty, depending on what you eat, what medicines you take, and other things. Waste collects constantly, so you will need to empty the pouch 5 to 8 times a day.</text></h2><h2 title="Standard Ileostomy"><text>The standard ileostomy is the most common kind of ileostomy that is done. </text><detail>The end of the ileum (part of your small intestine) is pulled through the wall of your abdomen. </detail><detail>Then it is sewn to your skin. </detail><detail>It is normal that the ileostomy bulges out an inch (2.5 centimeters) or so. This makes the ileostomy like a spout, and it protects the skin from being irritated from the stool.</detail><text>Most times, the stoma is placed in the right lower part of the belly on a flat surface of normal, smooth skin.</text></h2><h2 title="Continent Ileostomy (Abdominal Pouch) "><text>A continent ileostomy is a different type of ileostomy. With a continent ileostomy, a pouch that collects waste is made from part of the small intestine. This pouch stays inside your body, and it connects to your stoma through a valve that your surgeon creates. The valve prevents the stool from constantly draining out, so that you usually do not need to wear a pouch.</text><text>Waste is drained by putting a tube (catheter) through the stoma a few times each day.</text><text>Continent ileostomies are not done very often anymore. They can cause many problems that need medical treatment, and sometimes they need to be redone.</text></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>Ileostomy - types; Standard ileostomy; Brooke ileostomy; Continent ileostomy; Abdominal pouch; End ileostomy; Ostomy; Inflammatory bowel disease - ileostomy and your ileostomy type; Crohn disease - ileostomy and your ileostomy type; Ulcerative colitis - ileostomy and your ileostomy type</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 12/8/2016"><text>Updated by: Michael M.

<item><title>Sweetened beverages</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000335.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>Many sweetened drinks are high in calories and can cause weight gain, even in active people. If you feel like drinking something sweet, try to choose a beverage that is made with non-nutritive (or sugar-free) sweeteners. You can also add flavor to plain water or seltzer with fresh fruits or a splash of fruit juice.</text></h2><h2 title="Sweetened Drinks"><text>Drinking a lot of sugar-sweetened beverages can cause you to gain extra pounds. Even though these drinks are just liquid, they can add a lot of calories to your diet. And, because liquids do not fill you up as much as solid foods do, you probably will not eat any less at your next meal. Examples of the calories in some popular sweetened drinks are:</text><detail>A 16-ounce (480 ml) latte with whole milk has 220 calories.</detail><detail>A 20-ounce (600 ml) bottle of non-diet soda has 220 calories.</detail><detail>A 16-ounce (480 ml) glass of sweetened ice tea has 144 calories.</detail><detail>A 16-ounce (480 ml) Hawaiian Punch has 120 calories.</detail><detail>A 16-ounce (480 ml) Ocean Spray Cran-Apple juice has 308 calories.</detail><detail>A 16-ounce (480 ml) sports drink has 180 calories. </detail><text>The 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines recommend limiting added sugars to less than 10% of your daily calories. Read the ingredients and watch out for drinks that are high in sugar. Sugar can go by many names, including:</text><detail>Corn syrup</detail><detail>Dextrose</detail><detail>Fructose</detail><detail>High fructose corn syrup</detail><detail>Honey</detail><detail>Syrup</detail><detail>Agave syrup</detail><detail>Brown rice syrup</detail><detail>Molasses</detail><detail>Evaporated cane juice </detail></h2><h2 title="How About Fruit Juice?"><text>Fruits contain many important vitamins and other nutrients, but drinking too much fruit juice can be unhealthy and can lead to weight gain.</text><text>A 12-ounce (360 ml) serving of orange juice has about 170 calories. If you are already getting enough calories from the other foods you eat, an extra 170 calories a day can add up to 12 to 15 pounds (5.4 to 6.75 kg) a year.</text><text>If you like to drink juice, consider diluting it with water. Try to limit juice to 8 ounces (240 ml) or less per day. Whole fruits are a better choice than fruit juices.</text></h2><h2 title="Watch out for Those Coffee Drinks!"><text>Coffee drinks you have on the way to work and during coffee breaks can add plenty of extra calories and saturated fat, more often if you buy ones that have flavored syrups, whipped cream, or half-and-half added. They can cause major weight gain.</text><text>All of these examples are for 16-ounce (480 ml) drinks. You can buy these drinks in smaller and larger sizes, too:</text><detail>A flavored Frappuccino has more than 250 calories. With whipped cream, it has over 400 calories.</detail><detail>A nonfat mocha has 250 calories. With whipped cream, it has 320 calories.</detail><detail>A mocha made with whole milk and whipped cream has 400 calories.</detail><detail>A latte made with whole milk has 220 calories. With 1 flavor added, it has 290 calories.</detail><detail>A hot chocolate made with 2% milk has 320 calories. With whipped cream added, it has 400 calories.</detail><text>An unsweetened latte made with skim milk would be a healthy choice.</text></h2><h2 title="Healthier Coffee Choices"><text>Order regular coffee and add only nonfat or 1% milk or a fat-free or low-fat latte. Use a sugar substitute if you like your coffee sweet.</text><text>If you have a special coffee drink now and then, following these tips will cut down on the calories:</text><detail>Order the smallest size available. Skip the whipped cream on a mocha or hot chocolate and save about 100 calories.</detail><detail>Flavoring adds about 50 calories per tablespoon. Skip it if you can, or ask the server to use only half as much.</detail></h2><h2 title="What You Could Drink Instead"><text>Skim or low-fat milk are healthy choices. You can also choose drinks that have 5 calories or less per serving.</text><text>Some choices that have 0 calories are:</text><detail>Water</detail><detail>Diet soda</detail><detail>Sparkling water with natural flavors, such as lemon, lime, and berry</detail><detail>Plain coffee or tea </detail></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>Obesity - sweetened beverages; Overweight - sweetened beverages; Healthy diet - sweetened beverages; Weight loss - sweetened beverages </text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 8/14/2016"><text>Updated by: Emily Wax, RD, The Brooklyn Hospital Center, Brooklyn, NY.

Norovirus can spread easily in health care settings. Read on to learn how to prevent getting infected with norovirus if you're in the hospital.</text></h2><h2 title="What is Norovirus?"><text>Many viruses belong to the norovirus group, and they spread very easily. Outbreaks in health care settings occur rapidly and can be hard to control.</text></h2><h2 title="More About Norovirus"><text>Symptoms start within 24 to 48 hours of infection, and can last for 1 to 3 days. Diarrhea and vomiting can be severe, leading the body to not have enough fluids (dehydration).</text><text>Anyone can become infected with norovirus. Hospital patients who are very old, very young, or very ill are most harmed by norovirus illnesses.</text><text>Norovirus infection can occur at any time during the year. It can be spread when people:</text><detail>Touch objects or surfaces that have been contaminated, then put their hands in their mouths. (Contaminated means the norovirus germ is present.)</detail><detail>Eat or drink something contaminated. </detail><text>It is possible to be infected with norovirus more than once in your life.</text><text>Most cases do not need testing. In some cases, testing for norovirus is done to understand an outbreak, such as in a hospital setting. This test is done by collecting a stool or vomit sample and sending it to a lab.</text></h2><h2 title="Treating Norovirus"><text>Norovirus illnesses are not treated with antibiotics because antibiotics kill bacteria, not viruses. Receiving plenty of extra fluids through a vein (IV, or intravenous) is the best way to prevent the body from becoming dehydrated.</text><text>Symptoms most often resolve in 2 to 3 days.

This is a way to create barriers between people and germs.</text><detail>It prevents the spread of germs among the staff, patient, and visitors.</detail><detail>Isolation will last 48 to 72 hours after symptoms have gone way.</detail><text>Staff and health care providers must:</text><detail>Use proper garments, such as isolation gloves and a gown when entering an isolated patient's room.</detail><detail>Wear a mask when there is a chance of splashing bodily fluids.</detail><detail>Always clean and disinfect surfaces patients have touched using a bleach-based cleaner.</detail><detail>Limit moving patients to other areas of the hospital.</detail><detail>Keep patient's belongings in special bags and throw away any disposable items.</detail><text>Anyone visiting a patient who has an isolation sign outside their door should stop at the nurses' station before entering the patient's room.</text></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>Gastroenteritis - norovirus; Colitis - norovirus; Hospital acquired infection - norovirus</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 2/24/2018"><text>Updated by: Jatin M.

<item><title>Myths about drinking alcohol</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000856.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>We know much more about the effects of alcohol today than in the past. Yet, myths remain about drinking and drinking problems. Learn the facts about alcohol use so you can make healthy decisions.</text></h2><h2 title="Myth #1: I Do Not Have a Problem Because I Can Hold My Liquor"><text>Being able to have a few drinks without feeling any effects may seem like a good thing. In fact, if you need to drink increasing amounts of alcohol to feel an effect, it could be a sign you have a problem with alcohol.</text></h2><h2 title="Myth #2: I Only Drink on Weekends"><text>You do not need to drink every day to have a problem with alcohol. Heavy drinking is defined by how much alcohol you have in a day or in a week. </text><text>You may be at risk if you:</text><detail>Are a man and have more than 4 drinks a day or more than 14 drinks in a week.</detail><detail>Are a woman and have more than 3 drinks a day or more than 7 drinks in a week. </detail><text>Drinking this amount or more is considered heavy drinking. This is true even if you only do it on weekends. Heavy drinking can put you at risk for health problems such as heart disease, stroke, liver disease, sleep problems, and some types of cancer.</text></h2><h2 title="Myth #3: I Am Too Old to Have a Drinking Problem"><text>You may think that drinking problems have to start early in life. In fact, some people develop problems with drinking at a later age. </text><text>One reason is that people become more sensitive to alcohol as they get older. Or they may take medicines that make the effects of alcohol stronger. Some older adults may start to drink more because they are bored or feel lonely or depressed. </text><text>Even if you never drank that much when you were young, you can have problems with drinking as you get older. </text><text>What is a healthy range of drinking for men and women over age 65 years? Experts recommend no more than 3 drinks in a single day or no more than a total of 7 drinks a week. A drink is defined as 12 fluid ounces (355 mL) of beer, 5 fluid ounces (148 mL) of wine, or 1½ fluid ounces (45 mL) of liquor.</text></h2><h2 title="Myth #4: I Do Not Have a Problem Because I Only Drink Wine and Beer"><text>Problem drinking is not about what you drink, but how it affects your life. For example, if you can answer "yes" to any of the two following statements, drinking may be causing you problems.</text><detail>There are times when you drink more or longer than you planned to.</detail><detail>You have not been able to cut down or stop drinking on your own, even though you have tried or you want to.</detail><detail>You spend a lot of time drinking, being sick from drinking, or getting over the effects of drinking.</detail><detail>Your urge to drink is so strong, you cannot think about anything else.</detail><detail>As a result of drinking, you do not do what you are expected to do at home, work, or school. Or, you keep getting sick because of drinking.</detail><detail>You continue to drink, even though alcohol is causing problems with your family or friends.</detail><detail>You spend less time on or no longer take part in activities that used to be important or that you enjoyed. Instead, you use that time to drink.</detail><detail>Your drinking has led to situations that you or someone else could have been injured, such as driving while drunk or having unsafe sex.</detail><detail>Your drinking makes you anxious, depressed, forgetful, or causes other health problems, but you keep drinking.</detail><detail>You need to drink more than you did to get the same effect from alcohol. Or, the number of drinks you are used to having now have less effect than before.</detail><detail>When the effects of alcohol wear off, you have symptoms of withdrawal. These include, tremors, sweating, nausea, or insomnia. You may even have had a seizure or hallucinations (sensing things that are not there).</detail></h2><h2 title="Myth #5: Drinking is a Good Way to Take the Edge Off My Chronic Pain"><text>People with long-term (chronic) pain sometimes use alcohol to help manage pain. There are several reasons why this may not be a good choice.</text><detail>Alcohol and pain relievers do not mix. Drinking while taking pain relievers may increase your risk of liver problems, stomach bleeding, or other problems.</detail><detail>It increases your risk for alcohol problems. Most people need to drink more than a moderate amount to relieve pain. Also, as you develop a tolerance for alcohol, you will need to drink more to get the same pain relief. Drinking at that level increases your risk for alcohol problems.</detail><detail>Long-term (chronic) alcohol use can increase pain. If you have withdrawal symptoms from alcohol, you may feel more sensitive to pain. Also, heavy drinking over a long time can actually cause a certain type of nerve pain.</detail></h2><h2 title="Myth #6: If I Drink Too Much, Coffee Will Sober Me Up"><text>If you are drunk, nothing will help make you sober except time. Your body needs time to break down the alcohol in your system. The caffeine in coffee may help you stay awake. However, it will not improve your coordination or decision-making skills. These can be impaired for several hours after you stop drinking. This is why it is never safe to drive after you have been drinking, no matter how many cups of coffee you have.</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 7/8/2018"><text>Updated by: Ryan James Kimmel, MD, Medical Director of Hospital Psychiatry at the University of Washington Medical Center, Seattle, WA.

<item><title>Lung surgery - discharge </title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000242.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>You had surgery to treat a lung condition. Now that you're going home, follow your health care provider's instructions on how to care for yourself at home while you heal.</text></h2><h2 title="When You're in the Hospital"><text>You may have spent time in the intensive care unit (ICU) before going to a regular hospital room. A chest tube to drain fluid from inside your chest was in place part or all of the time you were in the hospital. You may still have it when you go home.</text></h2><h2 title="What to Expect at Home"><text>It will take 6 to 8 weeks to get your energy back. You may have pain when you move your arm, twist your upper body, and when you breathe in deeply.</text></h2><h2 title="Activity"><text>Ask your surgeon how much weight is safe for you to lift. You may be told not to lift or carry anything heavier than 10 pounds or 4.5 kilograms (about a gallon or 4 liters of milk) for 2 weeks after video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery and 6 to 8 weeks after open surgery.</text><text>You may walk 2 or 3 times a day. Start with short distances and slowly increase how far you walk. If you have stairs in your home, go up and down slowly. Take one step at a time. Set up your home so that you do not have to climb stairs too often.</text><text>Remember you will need extra time to rest after being active. If it hurts when you do something, stop doing that activity.</text><detail>DO NOT do yard work for 4 to 8 weeks after surgery. DO NOT use a push mower for at least 8 weeks. Ask your surgeon or nurse when you can start doing these things again.</detail><detail>You can start doing light housework 2 weeks after surgery. </detail><text>It is probably OK to start sexual activity when you can climb 2 flights of stairs without being short of breath. Check with your surgeon.</text><text>Make sure your home is safe as you are recovering. For example, remove throw rugs to prevent tripping and falling. To stay safe in the bathroom, install grab bars to help you get in and out of the tub or shower. </text><text>For the first 6 weeks after surgery, be careful how you use your arms and upper body when you move. Press a pillow over your incision when you need to cough or sneeze.</text><text>Ask your doctor when it is OK to start driving again. DO NOT drive if you are taking narcotic pain medicine. Drive only short distances at first. DO NOT drive when traffic is heavy.</text><text>It is common to take 4 to 8 weeks off work after lung surgery. Ask your surgeon when you can go back to work. You may need to adjust your work activities when you first go back, or work only part-time for a while.</text></h2><h2 title="Self-care"><text>Your surgeon will give you a prescription for pain medicine. Get it filled on your way home from the hospital so you have it when you need it. Take the medicine when you start having pain. Waiting too long to take it will allow the pain to get worse than it should.</text><text>You will use a breathing device to help you build up strength in your lung. It does this by helping you take deep breaths. Use it 4 to 6 times a day for the first 2 weeks after surgery.</text><text>If you smoke, ask your health care provider for help quitting. DO NOT let others smoke in your house.</text></h2><h2 title="Wound Care"><text>If you have a chest tube:</text><detail>There may be some skin soreness around the tube.</detail><detail>Clean around the tube once a day.</detail><detail>If the tube comes out, cover the hole with a clean dressing and call your surgeon right away.</detail><detail>Keep the dressing (bandage) on the wound for 1 to 2 days after the tube has been removed. </detail><text>Change the dressing on your incisions every day or as often as instructed. You will be told when you no longer need to keep the dressing on your incisions. Wash the wound area with mild soap and water. </text><text>You may take a shower once all of your dressings have been removed. </text><detail>DO NOT try to wash or scrub off the strips of tape or glue. It will fall off on its own in about a week.</detail><detail>DO NOT soak in a bathtub, pool, or hot tub until your surgeon tells you it is ok. </detail><text>Sutures (stitches) are usually removed after 7 days. Staples are usually removed after 7 to 14 days. If you have the kind of sutures that are inside your chest, your body will absorb them and you will not need to have them removed.</text></h2><h2 title="When to Call the Doctor"><text>Call your surgeon or nurse if you have any of the following:</text><detail>Fever of 101°F (38.3°C), or higher</detail><detail>Incisions are bleeding, red, warm to the touch, or have a thick, yellow, green, or milky drainage coming from them</detail><detail>Pain medicines do not ease your pain</detail><detail>It is hard to breathe</detail><detail>Cough that does not go away, or you are coughing up mucus that is yellow or green, or has blood in it</detail><detail>Cannot drink or eat</detail><detail>Your leg is swelling or you have leg pain</detail><detail>Your chest, neck, or face is swelling</detail><detail>Crack or hole in the chest tube, or the tube comes out</detail><detail>Cough up blood </detail></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>Thoracotomy - discharge; Lung tissue removal - discharge; Pneumonectomy - discharge; Lobectomy - discharge; Lung biopsy - discharge; Thoracoscopy - discharge; Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery - discharge; VATS - discharge</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 1/31/2017"><text>Updated by: Mary C.

<item><title>Low-salt diet </title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000109.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>Too much sodium in your diet can be bad for you. If you have high blood pressure or heart failure, you may be asked to limit the amount of salt you eat every day. These tips will help you choose foods that are lower in sodium.</text></h2><h2 title="Salt and Your Diet"><text>Your body needs salt to work properly. Salt contains sodium. Sodium helps your body control many functions. Too much sodium in your diet can be bad for you. For most people, dietary sodium comes from salt that is in or added to their food.</text><text>If you have high blood pressure or heart failure, you will likely be asked to limit how much salt you eat every day. Even people with normal blood pressure will have lower (and healthier) blood pressure if they lower how much salt they eat.</text><text>Dietary sodium is measured in milligrams (mg). Your health care provider may tell you to eat no more than 2,300 mg a day when you have these conditions. For some people, 1,500 mg a day is an even better goal.</text></h2><h2 title="Limiting Salt in Your Diet"><text>Eating a variety of foods every day can help you limit salt. Try to eat a balanced diet.</text><text>Buy fresh vegetables and fruits whenever possible. They are naturally low in salt. Canned foods often contain salt to preserve the color of the food and keep it looking fresh. For this reason, it is better to buy fresh foods. Also buy:</text><detail>Fresh meats, chicken or turkey, and fish</detail><detail>Fresh or frozen vegetables and fruits</detail><text>Look for these words on labels:</text><detail>Low-sodium</detail><detail>sodium-free</detail><detail>No salt added</detail><detail>Sodium-reduced</detail><detail>Unsalted</detail><text>Check all labels for how much salt foods contain per serving.</text><text>Ingredients are listed in order of the amount the food contains. Avoid foods that list salt near the top of the list of ingredients. A product with less than 100 mg of salt per serving is good.</text><text>Stay away from foods that are always high in salt. Some common ones are:</text><detail>Processed foods, such as cured or smoked meats, bacon, hot dogs, sausage, bologna, ham, and salami</detail><detail>Anchovies, olives, pickles, and sauerkraut</detail><detail>Soy and Worcestershire sauces, tomato and other vegetable juices, and most cheeses</detail><detail>Many bottled salad dressings and salad dressing mixes</detail><detail>Most snack foods, such as chips, crackers, and others</detail><text>When you cook, replace salt with other seasonings. Pepper, garlic, herbs, and lemon are good choices. Avoid packaged spice blends. They often contain salt.</text><text>Use garlic and onion powder, not garlic and onion salt. DO NOT eat foods with monosodium glutamate (MSG).</text><text>When you go out to eat, stick to steamed, grilled, baked, boiled, and broiled foods with no added salt, sauce, or cheese. If you think the restaurant might use MSG, ask them not to add it to your order.</text><text>Use oil and vinegar on salads. Add fresh or dried herbs. Eat fresh fruit or sorbet for dessert, when you have dessert. Take the salt shaker off your table. Replace it with a salt-free seasoning mix.</text><text>Ask your provider or pharmacist what antacids and laxatives contain little or no salt, if you need these medicines. Some have a lot of salt in them.</text><text>Home water softeners add salt to water. If you have one, limit how much tap water you drink. Drink bottled water instead.</text><text>Ask your provider if a salt substitute is safe for you. Many contain a lot of potassium. This may be harmful if you have certain medical conditions or if you are taking certain medicines. However, if extra potassium in your diet would not be harmful to you, a salt substitute is a good way to lower the amount of sodium in your diet.</text></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>Low-sodium diet; Salt restriction</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 7/12/2018"><text>Updated by: Laura J.

They consist of a one or more types of spirits mixed with other ingredients. They are sometimes called mixed drinks. Beer and wine are other forms of alcoholic beverages.</text><text>Cocktails contain extra calories that you may not have been counting if you are trying to lose weight. Cutting back on how much you drink and choosing lower-calorie options may help to avoid undesired weight gain and improve your overall health.</text><text>The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism defines a standard drink as containing roughly 14 grams of pure alcohol. This amount can be found in:</text><detail>12 ounces of regular beer, which is usually about 5% alcohol</detail><detail>5 ounces of wine, which is typically about 12% alcohol</detail><detail>1.5 ounces of distilled spirits, which is about 40% alcohol</detail></h2><h2 title="Alcoholic Beverage Options"><text>For beer and wine, try choosing lower-calorie options, such as:</text><detail>12 ounces (oz), or 355 mL, light beer: 105 calories</detail><detail>12 oz (355 mL) Guinness Draught beer: 125 calories</detail><detail>2 oz (59 mL) Sherry wine: 75 calories</detail><detail>2 oz (59 mL) port wine: 90 calories</detail><detail>4 oz (118 mL) Champagne: 85 calories</detail><detail>3 oz (88 mL) dry vermouth: 105 calories</detail><detail>5 oz (148 mL) red wine: 125 calories</detail><detail>5 oz (148 mL) white wine: 120 calories </detail><text>Limit higher-calorie options, such as:</text><detail>12 oz (355 mL) regular beer: 145 calories</detail><detail>12 oz (355 mL) craft beer: 170 calories or more</detail><detail>3.5 oz (104 mL) sweet wine: 165 calories</detail><detail>3 oz (88 mL) sweet vermouth: 140 calories </detail><text>Keep in mind that "craft" beers often contain more calories than commercial beers. This is because they may have more carbohydrates and extra ingredients that add up to a richer flavor -- and more calories.</text><text>To get an idea of how many calories are in a can or bottle of beer, read the label and pay attention to:</text><detail>Fluid oz (serving size)</detail><detail>Alcohol by Volume (ABV)</detail><detail>Calories (if listed) </detail><text>Choose beers that have fewer calories per serving and pay attention to how many servings are in the bottle or can.</text><text>Beers that have a higher ABV number will have more calories.</text><text>Many restaurants and bars serve beer in a pint, which contains more beer and calories than a 12-ounce (355 mL) glass. (For example, a pint of Guinness contains 210 calories.) So order a half pint or smaller pours instead.</text><text>Distilled spirits and liqueurs are often mixed with other juices and mixes to make cocktails. They are the base of the drink.</text><text>One "shot" (1.5 oz, or 44 mL) of:</text><detail>80-proof gin, rum, vodka, whiskey, or tequila each contain 100 calories</detail><detail>Brandy or cognac contain 100 calories</detail><detail>Liqueurs contain 165 calories </detail><text>Adding other liquids and mixers to your drinks can add up in terms of calories.

If you enjoy mixed drinks, think about how you can use fresh, low-calorie mixers for taste. Almost anything can be put in your blender and added to a distilled spirit.</text></h2><h2 title="Tips for Watching Your Calories"><text>Here are some tips for watching your calories:</text><detail>Use diet tonic, no-sugar added juices, and low-sugar sweeteners, such as agave, to reduce sugar content, or use a calorie-free mixer such as club soda or seltzer. Lemonade and lightly sweetened iced tea, for example, have fewer calories than regular fruit drinks. Diet options have even lower amounts of sugar.</detail><detail>Avoid sugary, powdered drink mixes. Use herbs or fruit or vegetables to add flavor.</detail><detail>Have a plan for ordering low-calorie cocktails at restaurants.</detail><detail>Make half drinks, or mini-drinks, in small glassware.</detail><detail>If you drink, have only 1 or 2 drinks per day. Women should have no more than one drink a day. Men should have no more than 2 drinks a day. Pace yourself by alternating alcoholic beverages with water </detail><text>Look for nutrition facts labels on bottles and cans of alcohol.

<item><title>Low white blood cell count and cancer</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000675.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>White blood cells (WBCs) fight infections from bacteria, viruses, fungi, and other pathogens (organisms that cause infection). One important type of WBC is the neutrophil. These cells are made in the bone marrow and travel in the blood throughout the body. They sense infections, gather at sites of infection, and destroy the pathogens. </text><text>When the body has too few neutrophils, the condition is called neutropenia. This makes it harder for the body to fight off pathogens. As a result the person is more likely to get sick from infections. In general, an adult who has fewer than 1,000 neutrophils in a microliter of blood has neutropenia.</text><text>If the neutrophil count is very low, fewer than 500 neutrophils in a microliter of blood, it is called severe neutropenia. When the neutrophil count gets this low, even the bacteria normally living in a person's mouth, skin, and gut can cause serious infections.</text></h2><h2 title="Why It Occurs"><text>A person with cancer can develop a low WBC count from the cancer or from treatment for the cancer. Cancer may be in the bone marrow, causing fewer neutrophils to be made. The WBC count can also go down when cancer is treated with chemotherapy drugs, which slow bone marrow production of healthy WBCs.</text></h2><h2 title="How Low Is Too Low?"><text>When your blood is tested, ask for your WBC count and specifically, your neutrophil count. If your counts are low, do what you can to prevent infections. Know the signs of infection and what to do if you have them.</text></h2><h2 title="What You Can Do to Prevent Infections"><text>Prevent infections by taking the following measures:</text><detail>Be careful with pets and other animals to avoid catching infections from them.</detail><detail>Practice safe eating and drinking habits.</detail><detail>Wash your hands often with soap and water.</detail><detail>Stay away from people who have symptoms of an infection.</detail></h2><h2 title="When to Call the Doctor"><text>If you have any of the following symptoms, call your health care provider:</text><detail>Fevers, chills, or sweats.

<item><title>Low blood sugar - self-care</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000085.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>Low blood sugar is a condition that occurs when your blood sugar (glucose) is lower than normal. Low blood sugar may occur in people with diabetes who are taking insulin or certain other medicines to control their diabetes. Low blood sugar can cause dangerous symptoms. Learn how to recognize the symptoms of low blood sugar and how to prevent them.</text></h2><h2 title="What is Low Blood Sugar?"><text>Low blood sugar is called hypoglycemia. A blood sugar level below 70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L) is low and can harm you. A blood sugar level below 54 mg/dL (3.0 mmol/L) is a cause for immediate action.</text><text>You are at risk for low blood sugar if you have diabetes and are taking any of the following diabetes medicines:</text><detail>Insulin</detail><detail>Glyburide (Micronase), glipizide (Glucotrol), glimepiride (Amaryl), repaglinide (Prandin), or nateglinide (Starlix)</detail><detail>Chlorpropamide (Diabinese), tolazamide (Tolinase), acetohexamide (Dymelor), or tolbutamide (Orinase) </detail><text>You are also at increased risk of having low blood sugar if you have had previous low blood sugar levels.</text></h2><h2 title="Recognizing Low Blood Sugar"><text>Know how to tell when your blood sugar is getting low. Symptoms include:</text><detail>Weakness or feeling tired</detail><detail>Shaking</detail><detail>Sweating</detail><detail>Headache</detail><detail>Hunger</detail><detail>Feeling uneasy, nervous, or anxious</detail><detail>Feeling cranky</detail><detail>Trouble thinking clearly</detail><detail>Double or blurry vision</detail><detail>Fast or pounding heartbeat</detail><text>Sometimes your blood sugar may be too low even if you do not have symptoms. If it gets too low, you may:</text><detail>Faint</detail><detail>Have a seizure</detail><detail>Go into a coma</detail><text>Some people who have had diabetes for a long time stop being able to sense low blood sugar. This is called hypoglycemic unawareness. Ask your health care provider if wearing a continuous glucose monitor and sensor can help you detect when your blood sugar is getting too low in order to help prevent symptoms.</text></h2><h2 title="Check Your Blood Sugar Often"><text>Talk with your provider about when you should check your blood sugar every day. People who have low blood sugar need to check their blood sugar more often.</text><text>The most common causes of low blood sugar are:</text><detail>Taking your insulin or diabetes medicine at the wrong time</detail><detail>Taking too much insulin or diabetes medicine</detail><detail>Not eating enough during meals or snacks after you have taken insulin or diabetes medicine</detail><detail>Skipping meals</detail><detail>Waiting too long after taking your medicine to eat your meals</detail><detail>Exercising a lot or at a time that is unusual for you</detail><detail>Not checking your blood sugar or not adjusting your insulin dose before exercising</detail><detail>Drinking alcohol </detail></h2><h2 title="Preventing Low Blood Sugar"><text>Preventing low blood sugar is better than having to treat it. Always have a source of fast-acting sugar with you.</text><detail>When you exercise, check your blood sugar levels. Make sure you have snacks with you.</detail><detail>Talk to your provider about reducing insulin doses on days that you exercise.</detail><detail>Ask your provider if you need a bedtime snack to prevent low blood sugar overnight. Protein snacks may be best.</detail><text>DO NOT drink alcohol without eating food. Women should limit alcohol to 1 drink a day and men should limit alcohol to 2 drinks a day. Family and friends should know how to help. They should know:</text><detail>The symptoms of low blood sugar and how to tell if you have them.</detail><detail>How much and what kind of food they should give you.</detail><detail>When to call for emergency help.</detail><detail>How to inject glucagon, a hormone that increases your blood sugar. Your doctor or nurse will tell you when to use this medicine. </detail><text>If you have diabetes, always wear a medical alert bracelet or necklace. This helps emergency medical workers know you have diabetes.</text></h2><h2 title="When Your Blood Sugar Gets Low"><text>Check your blood sugar whenever you have symptoms of low blood sugar. If your blood sugar is below 70 mg/dL, treat yourself right away.</text><detail>Eat something that has about 15 grams (g) of carbohydrates. Examples are 3 glucose tablets, one half cup (4 ounces or 237 mL) of fruit juice or regular, non-diet soda, 5 or 6 hard candies, 1 tablespoon (tbsp) or 15 mL of sugar, plain or dissolved in water, or 1 tbsp (15 mL) of honey or syrup.</detail><detail>Wait about 15 minutes before eating any more. Be careful not to eat too much. This can cause high blood sugar and weight gain.</detail><detail>Check your blood sugar again.</detail><detail>If you do not feel better in 15 minutes and your blood sugar is still lower than 70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L), eat something with 15 g of carbohydrate again.</detail><text>You may need to eat a snack with carbohydrates and protein if your blood sugar is in a safer range -- over 70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L) -- and your next meal is more than an hour away.</text><text>Ask your provider how to manage this situation. If these steps for raising your blood sugar do not work, call your doctor right away.</text></h2><h2 title="Talk to Your Doctor or Nurse"><text>If you use insulin and your blood sugar is frequently or consistently low, ask your doctor or nurse if you:</text><detail>Are injecting your insulin the right way</detail><detail>Need a different type of needle</detail><detail>Should change how much insulin you take</detail><detail>Should change the kind of insulin you take </detail><text>DO NOT make any changes without talking to your doctor or nurse first.</text><text>Sometimes hypoglycemia can be due to taking the wrong medicines. Check your medicines with your pharmacist.</text></h2><h2 title="When to Call the Doctor"><text>If signs of low blood sugar DO NOT improve after you have eaten a snack that contains sugar, have someone drive you to the emergency room or call your local emergency number (such as 911). DO NOT drive when your blood sugar is low. </text><text>Get medical help right away for a person with low blood sugar if the person is not alert or cannot be awakened. </text></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>Hypoglycemia - self care; Low blood glucose - self care</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 5/17/2018"><text>Updated by: Brent Wisse, MD, Associate Professor of Medicine, Division of Metabolism, Endocrinology &amp;amp; Nutrition, University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle, WA.

<item><title>Losing weight after pregnancy</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000586.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>You should plan to return to your pre-pregnancy weight by 6 to 12 months after delivery. Most women lose half of their baby weight by 6 weeks after childbirth (postpartum). The rest most often comes off over the next several months. </text><text>A healthy diet with daily exercise will help you shed the pounds. Breastfeeding can also help with postpartum weight loss.</text></h2><h2 title="Take Your Time"><text>Your body needs time to recover from childbirth. If you lose weight too soon after childbirth, it can take longer for you to recover. Give yourself until your 6-week checkup before trying to slim down. If you are breastfeeding, wait until your baby is at least 2 months old and your milk supply has normalized before drastically cutting calories.</text><detail>Aim for a weight loss of about a pound and a half a week. You can do this by eating healthy foods and adding in exercise once you are cleared by your health care provider for regular physical activity.</detail><detail>Women who are exclusively breastfeeding need about 500 more calories per day than they did before pregnancy. Get these calories from healthy choices such as fruits, vegetables, whole grains, low-fat dairy, and lean protein.</detail><detail>DO NOT drop below the minimum number of calories you need. </detail></h2><h2 title="Breastfeeding "><text>If you are breastfeeding, you will want to lose weight slowly. Weight loss that happens too fast can make you produce less milk. Losing about a pound and a half (670 grams) a week should not affect your milk supply or your health. </text><text>Breastfeeding makes your body burn calories which helps you lose weight. If you are patient, you may be surprised at how much weight you lose naturally while breastfeeding. </text></h2><h2 title="Eat to Lose Weight"><text>These healthy eating tips will help you lose weight safely.</text><detail>DO NOT skip meals. With a new baby, many new moms forget to eat. If you do not eat, you will have less energy, and it will not help you lose weight.</detail><detail>Eat 5 to 6 small meals a day with healthy snacks in between (rather than 3 larger meals).</detail><detail>Eat breakfast. Even if you do not normally eat in the mornings, get into the habit of having breakfast. It will give you energy to start your day and stop you from feeling tired later.</detail><detail>Slow down. When you take your time eating, you will notice that it is easier to tell that you are full. It is tempting to multitask, but if you focus on your meal you will be less likely to overeat.</detail><detail>Choose nonfat or low-fat dairy products. </detail><detail>When you reach for a snack try to include foods with fiber and protein to help keep you full (such as raw bell pepper or carrot with bean dip, apple slices with peanut butter, or a slice of whole-wheat toast with hard-boiled egg). Drink at least 12 cups of fluid a day. </detail><detail>Keep a water bottle near the spot where you usually feed the baby, that way you'll remember to drink when they do.</detail><detail>Limit drinks like sodas, juices, and other fluids with added sugar and calories. They can add up and keep you from losing weight.</detail><detail>Choose broiled or baked rather than fried foods.</detail><detail>Limit sweets, sugar, saturated fat and trans fats.</detail></h2><h2 title="Do Not Crash and Burn"><text>DO NOT go on a crash diet (not eating enough) or a fad diet (popular diets that limit certain types of foods and nutrients). They will probably make you drop pounds at first, but those first few pounds you lose are fluid and will come back. </text><text>Other pounds you lose on a crash diet may be muscle instead of fat. You will gain back any fat you lose on a crash diet once you return to normal eating. </text></h2><h2 title="Be Realistic"><text>You may not be able to return to your exact pre-pregnancy shape. For many women, pregnancy causes lasting changes in the body. You may have a softer belly, wider hips, and a larger waistline. Make your goals about your new body realistic. </text></h2><h2 title="Exercise"><text>A healthy diet combined with regular exercise is the best way to shed the pounds. Exercise will help you lose fat instead of muscle. </text><text>Once you are ready to start losing weight, eat a little less and move a little more each day. It may be tempting to push yourself into a hard routine for fast weight loss. But rapid weight loss is not healthy and is hard on your body. </text><text>DO NOT overdo it. Just a quick walk around the block with your baby in the stroller is a great way to start adding exercise to your daily routine. </text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 2/27/2017"><text>Updated by: Emily Wax, RD, The Brooklyn Hospital Center, Brooklyn, NY.

<item><title>Living with your ileostomy</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000075.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>You had an injury or disease in your digestive system and needed surgery called an ileostomy. The surgery changed the way your body gets rid of waste (feces).</text><text>Now you have an opening called a stoma in your belly. Waste will pass through the stoma into a pouch that collects it.</text><text>You will have many new sensations in your body from the physical changes the operation has caused. Over time you will need to learn how to deal with these feelings.</text></h2><h2 title="Talking With Others"><text>You may feel sad, discouraged, ashamed, or alone after getting an ileostomy. You may cry or become angry easily, or you may not have much patience.</text><text>Try talking with a close friend, your health care provider, or a family member you feel close to. Ask your provider about seeing a mental health counselor. There may also be a support group in your area for people who have had ileostomies.</text><text>When you eat out or go to a party, remember it is normal for most people to use the bathroom after they eat or drink. DO NOT feel embarrassed or self-conscious if you need to use the bathroom to empty your pouch.</text><text>You may be nervous about talking about your ileostomy with other people in your life. This is normal. You should not feel obliged to talk more than you want to, or even at all if people are curious and ask too many questions.</text><text>If you have children, they may ask to see your stoma or pouch. Try to be relaxed when you talk with them about it. Try to explain how it works and why you have it. Answer their questions so they do not develop wrong ideas about it on their own.</text><text>Attend a local ostomy support group if there is one in your area. You can go by yourself, or take a spouse, family member, or friend with you. It may help to talk to others who have ileostomies and share ideas. If you have a partner, it can help for both of you to talk with other couples about how they live with an ileostomy.</text></h2><h2 title="Your Clothing"><text>You should not need special clothes. Your pouch will mostly be flat. It cannot be seen under clothes in most cases.</text><text>Underwear, pantyhose, stretch pants, and Jockey shorts will not get in the way of your ostomy bag or stoma.</text><text>If you lost weight before your surgery from your illness, you may gain weight afterward. You may need to wear bigger clothes.</text></h2><h2 title="Going Back to Work and Day-to-Day Life"><text>Your provider will tell you when you can go back to work. Ask your provider what activities you can do.</text><text>People with ileostomies can do most jobs. Ask your provider if your type of work is safe to do. As with all major surgeries, it will take time for you to get stronger after your operation. Ask your provider for a letter you can give to your employer that explains why you need time off work.</text><text>It is a good idea to tell your employer, and maybe even a friend at work, about your ileostomy.</text><text>Heavy lifting may harm your stoma. A sudden blow to the stoma or pouch may also harm it.</text></h2><h2 title="Being Intimate With Your Partner"><text>You and your partner will probably have worries about your ileostomy. You may both feel uncomfortable about it. Things may not go smoothly when you begin being intimate again.</text><text>Contact between your body and your partner's body should not harm the ostomy. The ostomy will not have a bad odor if it is tightly sealed. To feel more secure, ask your ostomy nurse for a special wrap that may help protect your ostomy.</text><text>Talking openly about your feelings will help intimacy get better over time. </text></h2><h2 title="Sports"><text>An ostomy should not keep you from being active. People with ostomies:</text><detail>Run long distance</detail><detail>Lift weights</detail><detail>Ski</detail><detail>Swim</detail><detail>Play most other sports. </detail><text>Ask your provider which sports you can take part in once you get your strength back.</text><text>Many providers do not recommend contact sports because of possible injury to the stoma from a severe blow, or because the pouch may slip, but special protection can prevent these problems.</text><text>Weightlifting could cause a hernia at the stoma.</text><text>You can swim with your pouch in place. These tips may help:</text><detail>Choose bathing suit colors or patterns that will hide your ostomy.</detail><detail>Women can get a bathing suit that has a special lining, or they can wear stretch panties under their bathing suit to hold the pouch in place.</detail><detail>Men can wear bike shorts underneath their bathing suit, or wear swim trunks and a tank top.</detail><detail>Always empty your pouch before swimming. </detail></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>Standard ileostomy - living with; Brooke ileostomy - living with; Continent ileostomy - living with; Abdominal pouch - living with; End ileostomy - living with; Ostomy - living with; Crohn's disease - living with; Inflammatory bowel disease - living with; Regional enteritis - living with; Ileitis - living with; Granulomatous ileocolitis - living with; IBD - living with; Ulcerative colitis - living with</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 7/22/2016"><text>Updated by: Subodh K.

<item><title>Living with vision loss</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000526.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>Low vision is a visual disability. Wearing regular glasses or contacts does not help. People with low vision have already tried the available medical or surgical treatments. And no other treatments will help.</text><text>People with vision worse than 20/200, with glasses or contact lenses, are considered legally blind in most states in the US. But many people in this group still have some useful vision.</text><text>When you have low vision, you may have trouble driving, reading, or doing small tasks like sewing and crafts. But you can make changes in your home and in your routines that help you stay safe and independent. Many services are available for you to get the training and support to function independently. Two of these are the Braille Institute of America and Lighthouse Guild.</text></h2><h2 title="Using low Vision Aids "><text>The type of low vision aids and strategies for daily living you use will depend on your type of vision loss. Different aids and strategies are better suited for different problems.</text><text>The main types of visual loss are:</text><detail>Central (reading or recognizing faces across the room)</detail><detail>Peripheral (side)</detail><detail>No light perception (NLP), or complete blindness </detail><text>A normally-sighted family member or friend may need to help you set up some types of visual aids. Some options include:</text><detail>Magnifiers</detail><detail>High power reading glasses</detail><detail>Devices that make it easier to use cell phones and computers</detail><detail>Watches made for low vision, or talking watches and clocks</detail><detail>Telescopic glasses that may aid distance vision </detail></h2><h2 title="Maximize Lighting"><text>You should:</text><detail>Increase the overall lighting in your home.</detail><detail>Use a table or floor lamp that has a gooseneck or flexible arm. Point the light directly on your reading material or task.</detail><detail>Use incandescent or halogen bulbs in lamps to give a focused light. Be careful with these lights. They get hot, so do not use one too close to you for too long.</detail><detail>Use LED bulbs and lamps. They produce high contrast and do not get as hot as halogen bulbs.</detail><detail>Get rid of glare. Glare can really bother someone with low vision. </detail></h2><h2 title="Organize Your Home"><text>You will want to develop routines that make life easier with low vision. If your home is already well organized, you may need to make only small changes.</text><text>Have a place for everything.</text><detail>Keep things in the same place all the time. Put items in the same drawer or cabinet, or on the same table or counter space.</detail><detail>Put things back in the same place every time.</detail><detail>Store things in different size containers, such as egg cartons, jars, and shoe boxes. </detail><text>Become familiar with common things.</text><detail>Learn to recognize the shape of items, such as egg containers or cereal boxes.</detail><detail>Use a phone with large numbers, and memorize the keypad.</detail><detail>Fold different types of paper money in a different way. For example, fold a $10 bill in half and double fold a $20 bill.</detail><detail>Use Braille or large print checks. </detail><text>Label your things.</text><detail>Make labels using a simple form of Braille called uncontracted Braille.</detail><detail>Use small, raised dots, rubber bands, Velcro, or colored tape to label items.</detail><detail>Use caulking, raised rubber, or plastic dots to mark certain settings for appliances, such as temperature settings on the furnace thermostat and dial settings on the washer and dryer. </detail></h2><h2 title="Make Your Home Safe From Trips and Falls"><text>You should:</text><detail>Remove loose wires or cords from the floor.</detail><detail>Remove loose throw rugs.</detail><detail>NOT keep small pets in your home.</detail><detail>Fix any uneven flooring in doorways.</detail><detail>Put handrails in the bathtub or shower and next to the toilet.</detail><detail>Place a slip-proof mat in the bathtub or shower. </detail></h2><h2 title="Organize Your Clothes"><text>You should:</text><detail>Group your clothes. Keep pants in one part of the closet and shirts in another part.</detail><detail>Organize your clothes by color in your closet and drawers. Use sewing knots or clothing pins to code for color. For example, 1 knot or pin is black, 2 knots is white, and 3 knots is red. Cut rings out of cardboard. Put Braille labels or colors on the cardboard rings. Loop the rings onto hangers.</detail><detail>Use plastic rings to hold pairs of socks together, use these when you wash, dry, and store your socks.</detail><detail>Use large Ziploc bags to separate your underwear, bras, and pantyhose.</detail><detail>Organize jewelry by color. Use egg cartons or a jewelry box to sort jewelry.</detail></h2><h2 title="Organize Your Kitchen for Cooking and Eating"><text>You should:</text><detail>Use large-print cookbooks. Ask your doctor or nurse where you can get these books.</detail><detail>Use caulking, raised rubber, or plastic dots to mark the settings on the controls of your stove, oven, and toaster.</detail><detail>Store food in specific containers. Mark them with Braille labels.</detail><detail>Use a high contrast place mat so you can see your plate easily. For example, a white plate will stand out against a dark blue or dark green place mat. </detail></h2><h2 title="Handle Medicines Safely"><text>You should:</text><detail>Keep medicines organized in a cabinet so you know where they are.</detail><detail>Label medicine bottles with a felt tip pen so you can read them easily.</detail><detail>Use rubber bands or clips to tell your medicines apart.</detail><detail>Ask someone else to give you your medicines.</detail><detail>Read labels with a magnifying lens.</detail><detail>Use a pillbox with compartments for days of the week and times of the day.</detail><detail>Never guess when taking your medicines. If you are unsure of your doses, talk with your doctor, nurse, or pharmacist. </detail></h2><h2 title="Get Around Safely"><text>Learn to get around by yourself.</text><detail>Get trained to use a long white cane to help.</detail><detail>Practice with a trainer who is experienced in using this type of cane. </detail><text>Learn how to walk with someone else's help.</text><detail>Follow the other person's movement.</detail><detail>Hold the person's arm lightly above the elbow and walk slightly behind.</detail><detail>Make sure that your pace matches the other person's.</detail><detail>Ask the person to tell you when you are approaching steps or a curb. Approach steps and curbs head-on so you can find them with your toes.</detail><detail>Ask the person to tell you when you are going through a door.</detail><detail>Ask the person to leave you at a specific place. DO NOT be left in open space. </detail></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>Diabetes - vision loss; Retinopathy - vision loss; Low vision; Blindness - vision loss</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 3/6/2018"><text>Updated by: Franklin W.

These include:</text><detail>The type of room or space you are in, and how the room is set up.</detail><detail>The distance between you and the person talking. Sound fades over distance, so you will be able to hear better if you are closer to the speaker.</detail><detail>The presence of distracting background sounds, such as heat and air conditioning, traffic noises, or the radio or TV. In order for speech to be heard easily, it should be 20 to 25 decibels louder than any other surrounding noises.</detail><detail>Hard floors and other surfaces that cause sounds to bounce and echo. It is easier to hear in rooms with carpeting and upholstered furniture. </detail><text>Changes in your house or office can help you hear better:</text><detail>Make sure there is enough lighting to see facial features and other visual cues.</detail><detail>Position your chair so that your back is to a light source rather than your eyes.</detail><detail>If your hearing is better in one ear, position your chair so the person talking is more likely to speak into your stronger ear. </detail></h2><h2 title="When Taking Part in a Conversation"><text>To better follow a conversation:</text><detail>Stay alert and pay close attention to what the other person is saying.</detail><detail>Notify the person with whom you are speaking of your hearing difficulty.</detail><detail>Listen to the flow of the conversation for a while, if there are things you do not pick up at first. Certain words or phrases will often come up again in most conversations.</detail><detail>If you become lost, stop the conversation and ask for something to be repeated.</detail><detail>Use a technique called speech reading to help understand what is being said. This method involves watching a person's face, posture, gestures, and tone of voice to get the meaning of what is being said. This is different from lip reading. There needs to be enough light in the room to see the other person's face in order to use this technique.</detail><detail>Carry a notepad and pencil and ask for a key word or phrase to be written down if you do not catch it.</detail></h2><h2 title="What Else"><text>Many different devices to help people with hearing loss are available.

Learn about staying connected with people to help you cope with your illness.</text></h2><h2 title="Talk with People Who Have the Same Illness"><text>Sharing with and learning from people who have the same feelings as you can help you cope with your own illness.</text><detail>Find a support group in your area for people who have the same chronic illness as you. Many organizations and hospitals run support groups. Ask your health care provider how to find one.

There are online blogs and discussion groups about many topics, and you may find support this way. </detail></h2><h2 title="Tell Others about Your Chronic Illness"><text>You may find it hard to tell others that you have a chronic illness. You may worry that they will not want to know about it or that they will judge you. You may feel embarrassed about your illness. These are normal feelings. Thinking about telling people can be harder than actually telling them.</text><text>People will react in different ways. They may be:</text><detail>Surprised.</detail><detail>Nervous. Some people might not know what to say, or they might worry they will say the wrong thing. Let them know that there is no right way to react and no perfect thing to say.</detail><detail>Helpful.

Tell them as much as you feel comfortable. Ask them to respect your privacy if you don't want to talk about it.</text><text>If you attend a support group, you may want to take family members, friends or others along. This can help them learn more about your illness and how to support you.</text><text>If you are involved in an online discussion group, you might want to show family or friends some of the postings to help them learn more.</text><text>If you live alone and do not know where to find support:</text><detail>Ask your provider for ideas about where you can find support.</detail><detail>See if there is an agency where you can volunteer. Many health agencies rely on volunteers. For example, if you have cancer, you may be able to volunteer at the American Cancer Society.</detail><detail>Find out if there are talks or classes about your illness in your area. Some hospitals and clinics may offer these. This can be a good way to meet others with the same illness.</detail></h2><h2 title="Get Help With Your Daily Tasks"><text>You may need help with your self-care tasks, getting to appointments, shopping, or household chores. Keep a list of people who you can ask for help. Learn to be comfortable accepting help when it is offered. Many people are happy to help and are glad to be asked.</text><text>If you do not know someone who can help you, ask your provider or social worker about different services that may be available in your area. You may be able to get meals delivered to your home, help from a home health aide, or other services.</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 9/3/2016"><text>Updated by: Linda J.

<item><title>Lifting and bending the right way</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000414.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>Many people injure their backs when they lift objects the wrong way. When you reach your 30's, you are more likely to hurt your back when you bend to lift something up or put it down.</text><text>This may be because you have injured the muscles, ligaments, or disks in your spine in the past. Also, as we get older our muscles and ligaments become less flexible. And, the disks that act as cushions between the bones of our spine become more brittle as we age. All of these things make us more prone to having a back injury.</text></h2><h2 title="How you can Prevent Injury"><text>Know how much you can safely lift. Think about how much you have lifted in the past and how easy or hard that was. If an object seems too heavy or awkward, get help with it.</text><text>If your work requires you to do lifting that may not be safe for your back, talk to your supervisor. Try to determine the most weight you should have to lift. You may need to meet with a physical therapist or occupational therapist to learn how to safely lift this amount of weight.</text><text>To help prevent back pain and injury when you bend and lift:</text><detail>Spread your feet apart to give your body a wide base of support</detail><detail>Stand as close as possible to the object you are lifting</detail><detail>Bend at your knees, not at your waist or back</detail><detail>Tighten your stomach muscles as you lift the object up or lower it down</detail><detail>Hold the object as close to your body as you can</detail><detail>Slowly lift, using your muscles in your hips and knees</detail><detail>As you stand up with the object, DO NOT bend forward</detail><detail>DO NOT twist your back while you bend to reach the object, lift the object, or carry the object</detail><detail>Squat as you set the object down, using the muscles in your knees and hips. Keep your back straight when you squat down. </detail></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>Nonspecific back pain - lifting; Backache - lifting; Sciatica - lifting; Lumbar pain - lifting; Chronic back pain - lifting; Herniated disk - lifting; Slipped disk - lifting</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 9/7/2017"><text>Updated by: C.

<item><title>Life after weight-loss surgery</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000350.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>You may have just started to think about weight-loss surgery. Or you may have already made the decision to have surgery. Weight-loss surgery can help you:</text><detail>Lose weight</detail><detail>Improve or eliminate many health problems</detail><detail>Improve your quality of life</detail><detail>Live longer </detail><text>It is important to understand that there will be many other changes in your life. These include the way you eat, what you eat, when you eat, how you feel about yourself, and much more.</text><text>Weight-loss surgery is not the easy way out. You will still need to do the hard work of eating healthy foods, controlling portion sizes, and exercising.</text></h2><h2 title="What Does Rapid Weight Loss Feel Like?"><text>As you lose weight quickly over the first 3 to 6 months, you may feel tired or cold at times. You may also have:</text><detail>Body aches</detail><detail>Dry skin</detail><detail>Hair loss or hair thinning</detail><detail>Mood changes </detail><text>These problems should go away as your body gets used to the weight loss and your weight becomes stable. It is important that you follow your doctor's recommendations for eating enough protein and taking vitamins.</text><text>You may become sad after having weight-loss surgery. The reality of life after surgery may not exactly match your hopes or expectations before surgery. You may be surprised that certain habits, feelings, attitudes, or worries may still be present, such as:</text><detail>You thought you would no longer miss food after surgery, and the urge to eat high-calorie foods would be gone.</detail><detail>You expected friends and family would treat you differently after you lost weight.</detail><detail>You hoped the sad or nervous feelings you had would go away after surgery and weight loss.</detail><detail>You miss certain social rituals such as sharing food with friends or family, eating certain foods, or eating out with friends. </detail><text>Complications, or a slow recovery from surgery, or all the follow-up visits may conflict with the hope that everything was going to be better and easier afterward.</text></h2><h2 title="How Will Eating and Drinking be Different?"><text>You will be on a liquid or puréed foods diet for 2 or 3 weeks after surgery. You will slowly add soft foods and then regular foods to your diet. You will likely be eating regular foods by 6 weeks.</text><text>At first, you will feel full very quickly, often after just a few bites of solid food. The reason is that your new stomach pouch or gastric sleeve will hold only a small amount of food soon after surgery. Even when your pouch or sleeve is larger, it may not hold more than about 1 cup (240 milliliters) of chewed food. A normal stomach can hold up to 4 cups (1 liter) of chewed food.</text><text>Once you are eating solid food, each bite must be chewed very slowly and completely, up to 20 or 30 times. Food must be a smooth or puréed texture before swallowing.</text><detail>The opening for your new stomach pouch will be very small. Food that is not chewed well can block this opening and may cause you to vomit or have pain under your breastbone.</detail><detail>Each meal will take at least 30 minutes.</detail><detail>You will need to eat 6 small meals throughout the day instead of 3 big meals.</detail><detail>You will need to avoid snacking between meals.</detail><detail>Some foods may cause some pain or discomfort when you eat them if they are not chewed well. These include pasta, rice, bread, raw vegetables, or meats, and any dry, sticky, or stringy foods. </detail><text>You will need to drink up to 8 glasses of water or other liquids that do not have calories every day.</text><detail>Avoid drinking anything while you are eating, and for 60 minutes before or after you eat. Having liquid in your pouch will wash food out of your pouch and make you hungrier.</detail><detail>Like with food, you will need to take small sips and not gulp.</detail><detail>DO NOT use straws because they bring air into your stomach. </detail></h2><h2 title="Will You Still Need to Think About Calories? "><text>Weight-loss surgery can help train you to eat less. But surgery is only a tool. You still have to make the right food choices.</text><text>After surgery, your doctor, nurse, or dietitian will teach you about foods you can eat and foods to avoid. It is very important to follow your diet. Eating mostly protein, fruits, vegetables, and whole grains will still be the best way to lose weight and keep it off.</text><text>You will still need to stop eating when you are satisfied. Eating until you feel full all the time may stretch out your pouch and reduce the amount of weight you lose.</text><text>You will still need to avoid foods that are high in calories. Your doctor or dietitian will likely tell you:</text><detail>DO NOT eat foods that contain a lot of fats, sugar, or carbohydrates.</detail><detail>DO NOT drink fluids that have a lot of calories or that contain sugar, fructose, or corn syrup.</detail><detail>DO NOT drink carbonated drinks (drinks with bubbles).</detail><detail>DO NOT drink alcohol. It contains a lot of calories, and does not provide nutrition. </detail></h2><h2 title="Staying Healthy"><text>It is important to get all of the nutrition you need without eating too many calories. Because of the quick weight loss, you will need to be careful that you get all of the nutrition and vitamins you need as you recover.</text><text>If you have gastric bypass or vertical sleeve surgery, you will need to take extra vitamins and minerals for the rest of your life.</text><text>You will need regular checkups with your doctor to follow your weight loss and make sure you are eating well.</text></h2><h2 title="Changes in Your Body"><text>After losing so much weight, you can expect changes in your body shape and contour. These changes may include excess or saggy skin and loss of muscle mass. The more weight you lose, the more excess or saggy skin you will have. Excess or saggy skin tends to show most around the belly, thighs, buttocks, and upper arms. It may also show in your chest, neck, face, and other areas as well. Talk with your doctor about options for reducing the excess skin.</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 6/1/2017"><text>Updated by: John E.

Put a clean towel under your leg before you take the old dressing off. Remove the tape.

You may have had an accident, or your leg may have had a blood clot, infection, or disease, and doctors could not save it.</text></h2><h2 title="What to Expect at Home"><text>You may feel sad, angry, frustrated and depressed. All of these feelings are normal and may arise in the hospital or when you get home.</text><text>It will take time for you to learn to use a walker, and a wheelchair. It will also take time to learn to get in and out of the wheelchair.</text><text>You may be getting a prosthesis, a man-made limb to replace your limb that was removed. It will take time for your prosthesis to be made. When you have it, getting used to it will also take time.</text><text>You may have pain in your limb for several days after your surgery. You may also have a feeling that your limb is still there. This is called phantom sensation. </text></h2><h2 title="Self-care"><text>Family and friends can help. Talking with them about your feelings may make you feel better. They can also help you do things around your house and when you go out.</text><text>If you feel sad or depressed, ask your health care provider about seeing a mental health counselor for help with your feelings about your amputation.</text><text>If you have diabetes, keep your blood sugar in good control.</text><text>If you have poor blood flow, follow your provider's instructions for diet and medicines.

Ask your provider for help on how to quit.</text></h2><h2 title="Activity"><text>Do things that will help you get stronger and do your daily activities, such as bathing and cooking. You should try to do as much as possible on your own.</text><text>When you are sitting, keep your stump straight and level. You can put your stump on a padded board to keep it straight when you are sitting. You can also lie on your belly to make sure your leg is straight. This can help keep your joints from getting stiff.</text><text>Try not to turn your stump in or out when you are lying in bed or sitting in a chair. You can use rolled up towels or blankets next to your legs to keep them in line with your body.</text><text>DO NOT cross your legs when you are sitting. It can stop the blood flow to your stump.</text><text>You may raise up the foot of your bed to keep your stump from swelling and to help ease pain. DO NOT place a pillow under your stump.</text></h2><h2 title="Wound and Stump Care"><text>Keep your wound clean and dry unless your provider tells you it is OK to get it wet. Clean the area around the wound gently with mild soap and water. DO NOT rub the incision. Allow water to flow gently over it. DO NOT take a bath or swim.</text><text>After your wound is healed, keep it open to the air unless a provider or nurse tells you something different. After dressings have been removed, wash your stump daily with mild soap and water. DO NOT soak it. Dry it well. </text><text>Inspect your stump everyday. Use a mirror if it is hard for you to see all around it. Look for any red areas or dirt.</text><text>Wear your elastic bandage all the time. Rewrap it every 2 to 4 hours. Make sure there are no creases in it. Wear your stump protector whenever you are out of bed.</text><text>Ask your provider for help with pain. Two things that may help are:</text><detail>Tapping along the scar and in small circles along the stump, if that is not painful</detail><detail>Rubbing the scar and stump gently with linen or soft cotton </detail><text>Lie on your stomach 3 or 4 times a day for about 20 minutes.

It is also called a breathing machine or respirator. The ventilator: </text><detail>Is attached to a computer with knobs and buttons that are controlled by a respiratory therapist, nurse, or doctor.</detail><detail>Has tubes that connect to the person through a breathing tube. The breathing tube is placed in the person's mouth or in an opening through the neck into the windpipe (trachea). This opening is called a tracheostomy.</detail><detail>Makes noise and has alarms that alert the health care team when something needs to be fixed or changed. </detail></h2><h2 title="How Does Being on a Ventilator Feel?"><text>A person receives medicine to remain comfortable while on a ventilator, especially if they have a breathing tube in their mouth. The medicine may cause people to be too sleepy to open their eyes or stay awake for more than a few minutes.</text><text>People cannot talk because of the breathing tube. When they are awake enough to open their eyes and move, they can communicate in writing.</text><text>People on ventilators will have many wires and tubes on them. This may look scary, but these wires and tubes help to carefully monitor them.</text><text>Some people may have restraints. These are used to prevent them from pulling out any important tubes and wires.</text></h2><h2 title="Why are Ventilators Needed?"><text>People are placed on ventilators when they cannot breathe on their own.

Some people with a tracheostomy may be able to be at home.</text><text>People on a ventilator are watched carefully for lung infections. When connected to a ventilator, a person has a hard time coughing out mucus. If mucus collects, the lungs do not get enough oxygen. The mucus can also lead to pneumonia. To get rid of the mucus, a procedure called suctioning is needed. This is done by inserting a small thin tube into the person's mouth or neck opening to vacuum out the mucus.</text><text>When the ventilator is used for more than a few days, the person may receive nutrition through tubes into either a vein or their stomach.</text><text>Because the person cannot speak, special efforts need to be made to monitor them and provide them with other ways to communicate.</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 10/23/2017"><text>Updated by: Denis Hadjiliadis, MD, MHS, Paul F.

It can also be bad for your heart and cause stomach problems, trouble sleeping, and headaches.</text><text>You may need help controlling your anger if you:</text><detail>Often get into arguments that spin out of control</detail><detail>Become violent or break things when angry</detail><detail>Threaten others when you are angry</detail><detail>Have been arrested or jailed because of your anger</detail></h2><h2 title="How Anger Management Works"><text>Anger management teaches you how to express your anger in a healthy way. You can learn to express your feelings and needs while respecting others.</text><text>Here are some ways to manage your anger. You can try one or combine a few:</text><detail>Pay attention to what triggers your anger. You may need to do this after you calm down. Knowing when you may get angry can help you plan ahead to manage your reaction.</detail><detail>Change your thinking. Angry people often see things in terms of "always" or "never." For example, you may think "you never support me" or "things always go wrong for me." The fact is, this is rarely true. These statements can make you feel that there is no solution. This only fuels your anger. Try to avoid using these words. This can help you see things more clearly. It may take a little practice at first, but it will get easier the more you do it.</detail><detail>Find ways to relax. Learning to relax your body and mind can help you calm down. There are many different relaxation techniques to try. You can learn them from classes, books, DVDs, and online. Once you find a technique that works for you, you can use it whenever you start to feel angry.</detail><detail>Take a time out. Sometimes, the best way to calm your anger is to get away from the situation that is causing it. If you feel like you are about to blow up, take a few minutes alone to cool off. Tell family, friends, or trusted coworkers about this strategy ahead of time. Let them know you will need a few minutes to calm down and will return when you have cooled off.</detail><detail>Work to solve problems. If the same situation makes you feel angry over and over, look for a solution. For example, if you get angry every morning sitting in traffic, look for a different route or leave at a different time. You could also try public transportation, riding your bike to work, or listening to a book or calming music.</detail><detail>Learn to communicate. If you find yourself ready to fly off the handle, take a moment to slow down. Try to listen to the other person without jumping to conclusions. DO NOT respond with the first thing that pops into your mind. You may regret it later. Instead, take a moment to think about your answer. </detail></h2><h2 title="For More Help"><text>If you need more help dealing with your anger, look for a class on anger management or talk with a counselor who specializes in this topic. Ask your health care provider for suggestions and referrals.</text></h2><h2 title="When to Call the Doctor"><text>You should call your provider:</text><detail>If you feel like your anger is out of control</detail><detail>If your anger is affecting your relationships or work</detail><detail>You are concerned you might hurt yourself or others </detail></h2><h2 title="Review Date 8/3/2018"><text>Updated by: Linda J.

<item><title>Learn to love exercise</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000764.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>You know exercise is good for you. It can help you lose weight, relieve stress, and boost your mood. You also know it helps prevent heart disease and other health problems. But despite knowing these facts, you may still struggle to get regular exercise.</text><text>Improve your perception of exercise. DO NOT see it as just something you should do, but as something you want to do. Tailor your exercise routine, so it becomes something you actually look forward to doing. </text></h2><h2 title="Do Activities You Enjoy"><text>With so many options for exercise, there is no need to suffer through a workout you do not like.</text><detail>Be true to yourself. Look for activities that suit your personality. If you are a social butterfly, try group activities, such as dance classes, a cycling club, or a walking group. Many groups welcome new members at all levels. If competition is what drives you, take up softball or join a rowing club. If you prefer solo exercise, consider jogging or swimming.</detail><detail>Try something new. There is a whole world of exercise possibilities out there, from salsa classes, to kayaking, to rock climbing. You never know what activities you might enjoy until you try them. So see what is available in your area and go for it. Whether it is horseback riding, belly dancing, or water polo, find an activity or sport that interests you and sign-up. If you find it hard to go alone, bring a friend or family member.</detail><detail>Channel your inner child. Think about activities you enjoyed as a child and try them again. Was it roller skating, dance, maybe basketball? You may be surprised at how much you still enjoy your childhood pastimes. Many communities have adult leagues and classes you can join.</detail><detail>Choose your sweet spot. Do you love being outdoors? Choose activities that get you outside, such as walking, hiking, or gardening. If you prefer to exercise indoors, think about swimming, active video games, or yoga.</detail><detail>Mix it up. Even the most fun activity can get boring if you do it day after day. Find a few things you like and mix it up. For example, you might play golf on a Saturdays, take tango classes on Mondays, and swim laps on Wednesdays.</detail><detail>Add a soundtrack. Listening to music helps the time pass and keeps your pace up. Or, you might try listening to audio books while you walk or ride a stationary bike. Just be sure the volume is low enough for you to hear what is going on around you. </detail></h2><h2 title="Stay Motivated"><text>Getting started with a routine is just the first step. You will also need help staying motivated so that you keep up your new habits.</text><detail>Remind yourself how much you like exercising. Most people feel really good after exercising. But for some reason, it's hard to remember that feeling before your next workout. As a reminder, make a few notes about how good you feel after a workout. Or, take a photo of yourself after a workout and stick it on the fridge for inspiration.</detail><detail>Share your progress online. Social media offers a number of ways to share your progress and get positive feedback from friends. Look for websites where you can track your daily walk or run. If you like to write, start a blog about your adventures.</detail><detail>Sign up for a charity event. Charity events offer you the chance to walk, ski, run, or bike for a good cause. Not only are these events fun, but training for them can help keep your motivation up. Many charities help participants by arranging training runs or bikes. You'll get fit while meeting new friends. Or, boost your motivation by signing up for the event with family, friends, or coworkers.</detail><detail>Reward yourself. Treat yourself for hitting your goals. Think about rewards that support your efforts, such as new walking shoes, a heart rate monitor, or a GPS watch you can use to track your workouts. Small rewards work as well, such as tickets to a concert or movie. </detail></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>Prevention - learn to love exercise; Wellness - learn to love exercise</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 4/15/2018"><text>Updated by: Linda J.

<item><title>Learn about gluten-free diets</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000813.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>On a gluten-free diet, you do not eat wheat, rye, and barley. These foods contain gluten, a type of protein. A gluten-free diet is the main treatment for celiac disease. Some people believe a gluten-free diet can also help improve other health problems, but there is little research to support this idea.</text></h2><h2 title="Reasons to Avoid Gluten"><text>People follow a gluten-free diet for a number of reasons:</text><text>Celiac disease. People with this condition cannot eat gluten because it triggers an immune response that damages the lining of their GI tract. This response causes inflammation in the small intestine and makes it hard for the body to absorb nutrients in food. Symptoms include bloating, constipation, and diarrhea.</text><text>Gluten sensitivity. People with gluten sensitivity do not have celiac disease. Eating gluten causes many of the same symptoms as in celiac disease, without the stomach damage.</text><text>Gluten intolerance. This describes people who have symptoms and may or may not have celiac disease. Symptoms include cramping, bloating, nausea, and diarrhea.</text><text>If you have one of these conditions, a gluten-free diet will help control your symptoms. It also helps prevent health problems in people with celiac disease. If you suspect you have one of these conditions, talk with your health care provider before making any diet changes.</text><text>Other health claims. Some people go gluten-free because they believe it can help control health problems such as headaches, depression, long-term (chronic) fatigue, and weight gain. However, these claims are unproven.</text><text>Because you cut out a whole group of foods, a gluten-free diet can cause you to lose weight. However, there are easier diets to follow for weight loss. People with celiac disease often gain weight because their symptoms improve.</text></h2><h2 title="How it Works"><text>On this diet, you need to learn which foods contain gluten and avoid them. This is not easy, because gluten is in many foods and food products. </text><text>Many foods are naturally gluten-free, including:</text><detail>Fruits and vegetables</detail><detail>Meat, fish, poultry, and eggs</detail><detail>Beans</detail><detail>Nuts and seeds</detail><detail>Dairy products </detail><text>Other grains and starches are fine to eat, as long as they do not come boxed with seasonings:</text><detail>Quinoa</detail><detail>Amaranth</detail><detail>Buckwheat</detail><detail>Cornmeal</detail><detail>Millet</detail><detail>Rice </detail><text>You can also buy gluten-free versions of foods such as bread, flour, crackers, and cereals. These products are made with rice and other gluten-free flours. Keep in mind that they are often higher in sugar and calories and lower in fiber than the foods they replace.</text></h2><h2 title="Off-Limit Foods"><text>When following this diet, you must avoid foods that contain gluten:</text><detail>Wheat</detail><detail>Barley (this includes malt, malt flavoring, and malt vinegar)</detail><detail>Rye</detail><detail>Triticale (a grain that is a cross between wheat and rye)</detail><text>You must also avoid these foods, which contain wheat:</text><detail>Bulgur</detail><detail>Couscous</detail><detail>Durum flour</detail><detail>Farina</detail><detail>Graham flour</detail><detail>Kamut</detail><detail>Semolina</detail><detail>Spelt</detail><text>Note that "wheat free" does not always mean gluten free. Many foods contain gluten or traces of wheat. Read the label and only buy "gluten free" options of:</text><detail>Bread and other baked goods</detail><detail>Pastas</detail><detail>Cereals</detail><detail>Crackers</detail><detail>Beer</detail><detail>Soy sauce</detail><detail>Seitan</detail><detail>Breading</detail><detail>Battered or deep-fried foods</detail><detail>Oats</detail><detail>Packaged foods, including frozen foods, soups, and rice mixes</detail><detail>Salad dressings, sauces, marinades, and gravies</detail><detail>Some candies, licorice</detail><detail>Some medicines and vitamins (gluten is used to bind the pill ingredients together)</detail></h2><h2 title="The Role of Exercise"><text>A gluten-free diet is a way of eating, so exercise is not included as part of the plan. However, you should exercise for at least 30 minutes a day on most days for good health. </text></h2><h2 title="Health Benefits"><text>People with celiac disease must follow a gluten-free diet to prevent damage to their intestines.</text><text>Avoiding gluten will not improve your heart health if you do not eat healthy foods. Be sure to substitute plenty of whole grains, fruit, and vegetables in place of gluten.</text></h2><h2 title="Possible Health Concerns"><text>Many foods made with wheat flour are fortified with vitamins and minerals. Cutting out wheat and other grains can leave you short of nutrients like these:</text><detail>Calcium</detail><detail>Fiber</detail><detail>Folate</detail><detail>Iron</detail><detail>Niacin</detail><detail>Riboflavin</detail><detail>Thiamin </detail><text>To get all the vitamins and minerals you need, eat a variety of healthy foods. Working with your provider or a dietitian can also help ensure you get proper nutrition.</text></h2><h2 title="Ease of Use"><text>Because so many foods contain gluten, this can be a hard diet to follow. It can feel limiting when you shop or eat out. However, as the diet has become more popular, gluten-free foods have become available in more stores. Also, many restaurants are now offering gluten-free meals.</text></h2><h2 title="Where to Find More Information"><text>The National Institutes of Health has a Celiac Awareness Campaign at celiac.nih.gov with information and resources.</text><text>You can find information on celiac disease, gluten sensitivity, and gluten-free cooking from these organizations:</text><detail>Beyond Celiac -- www.beyondceliac.org</detail><detail>Celiac Disease Foundation -- celiac.org</detail><text>There are also a number of books on gluten-free eating. Your best bet is to find one written by a dietitian.</text></h2><h2 title="When to Call the Doctor"><text>If you think you may have celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, talk with your provider. You should be tested for celiac disease, which is a serious condition.</text><text>If you have symptoms of gluten sensitivity or intolerance, DO NOT stop eating gluten without first getting tested for celiac disease. You may have a different health condition that a gluten-free diet cannot treat. Also, following a gluten-free diet for several months or years may make it more difficult to accurately diagnose celiac disease. If you stop eating gluten before being tested, it will affect the results.</text></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>Celiac and gluten</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 8/3/2018"><text>Updated by: Linda J.

The camera is called a laparoscope. This type of surgery is called laparoscopy.</text></h2><h2 title="What to Expect at Home"><text>You may lose weight quickly over the first 3 to 6 months. During this time, you may have: </text><detail>Body aches</detail><detail>Feel tired and cold</detail><detail>Dry skin</detail><detail>Mood changes</detail><detail>Hair loss or hair thinning </detail><text>These problems should go away as your body gets used to your weight loss and your weight becomes stable. Weight loss may be slower after this.</text></h2><h2 title="Activity"><text>Being active soon after surgery will help you recover more quickly. During the first week:</text><detail>Take short walks and going up and down stairs.</detail><detail>Try getting up and moving around if you are having some pain in your belly. It may help the pain. </detail><text>If it hurts when you do something, stop doing that activity.</text><text>If you have laparoscopic surgery, you should be able to do most of your regular activities in 2 to 4 weeks.</text></h2><h2 title="Diet "><text>Laparoscopic gastric banding made your stomach smaller by closing off part of your stomach with an adjustable band. After surgery you will eat less food, and you will not be able to eat quickly.</text><text>Your health care provider will teach you about foods you can eat and foods you should avoid. It is very important to follow these diet guidelines.</text><text>You will eat only liquid or puréed food for 2 to 3 weeks after your surgery. You will slowly add in soft foods, and then regular foods.</text></h2><h2 title="Wound Care"><text>Keep your dressings (bandage) on your wounds clean and dry. If you have sutures (stitches) or staples, they will be removed about 7 to 10 days after surgery. Some stitches can dissolve on their own. Your provider will tell if you have this kind.</text><text>Change the dressings (bandages) every day if you were told to do so. Be sure to change them more often if they get dirty or wet.</text><text>You may have bruising around your wound. This is normal. It will go away on its own. The skin around your incisions may be a little red. This is normal, too. </text><text>DO NOT wear tight clothing that rubs against your incisions while they heal.</text><text>Unless you are told otherwise, DO NOT shower until after your follow-up appointment with your provider. When you can shower, let water run over your incision, but DO NOT scrub it or let the water beat down on it.</text><text>DO NOT soak in a bathtub, swimming pool, or hot tub until your doctor tells you it is OK.</text></h2><h2 title="Follow-up"><text>By the time you leave the hospital, you will likely have a follow-up appointment scheduled with your surgeon within a few weeks. You will see your surgeon several more times in the first year after your surgery.</text><text>You may also have appointments with:</text><detail>A nutritionist or dietitian, who will teach you how to eat correctly with your smaller stomach. You will also learn about what foods and drinks you should have after surgery.</detail><detail>A psychologist, who can help you follow your eating and exercise guidelines and deal with the feelings or concerns you may have after surgery. </detail><text>The band around your stomach is filled with saline (saltwater). It is connected to a container (access port) that is placed under your skin in your upper belly. Your surgeon can make the band tighter or looser by increasing or decreasing the amount of saline in the band. To do this, your surgeon will insert a needle through your skin into the access port.</text><text>Your surgeon can make the band tighter or looser any time after you have this surgery. It may be tightened or loosened if you are:</text><detail>Not losing enough weight</detail><detail>Having problems eating</detail><detail>Vomiting after you eat </detail></h2><h2 title="When to Call the Doctor"><text>Call your provider if:</text><detail>Your temperature is above 101°F (38.3°C).</detail><detail>Your incisions are bleeding, red, warm to the touch, or have a thick, yellow, green, or milky drainage.</detail><detail>You have pain that your pain medicine is not helping.</detail><detail>You have trouble breathing.</detail><detail>You have a cough that does not go away.</detail><detail>You cannot drink or eat.</detail><detail>Your skin or the white part of your eyes turns yellow.</detail><detail>Your stools are loose, or you have diarrhea.</detail><detail>You are vomiting after eating. </detail></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>Lap-Band - discharge; LAGB - discharge; Laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding - discharge; Bariatric surgery - laparoscopic gastric banding - discharge; Obesity gastric banding discharge; Weight loss - gastric banding discharge</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 6/27/2016"><text>Updated by: Ann Rogers, MD, Associate Professor of Surgery; Director, Penn State Surgical Weight Loss Program, Penn State Milton S.

<item><title>Lacerations - liquid bandage</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000497.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>A laceration is a cut that goes all the way through the skin. A small cut can be cared for at home. A large cut requires immediate medical attention.</text><text>If the cut is minor, a liquid bandage (liquid adhesive) can be used on the cut to close the wound and help stop bleeding.</text><text>Using a liquid bandage is quick to apply. It causes only slight burning when applied. Liquid bandages seal the cut closed after only 1 application. There is less chance for infection since the wound is sealed shut.</text><text>These products are waterproof, so you can shower or bathe without worry.</text><text>The seal lasts for 5 to 10 days. It will fall off naturally after it has done its job. In some cases after the seal falls off, you can reapply more liquid bandage, but only after seeking medical advice from your provider. But most minor cuts will be mostly healed at this point.</text><text>Using these products may also help keep scars from forming at the injury site. Liquid adhesives can be found at your local pharmacy.</text></h2><h2 title="Applying and Caring for a Liquid Bandage"><text>With clean hands or a clean towel, wash the area of the cut with cold water and soap. Dry with a clean towel. Make sure the site is completely dry.</text><text>The liquid bandage should not be placed inside the wound, but on top of the skin, where the cut comes together.</text><detail>Create a seal by gently bringing the cut together with your fingers.</detail><detail>Apply the liquid bandage over the top of the cut. Spread it from one end of the cut to the other, covering the cut completely.</detail><detail>Hold the cut together for about a minute to give the adhesive enough time to dry. </detail><text>DO NOT use liquid bandage around the eyes, in the ear or nose, or internally in the mouth. If the liquid is accidentally applied to any of these areas call your health care provider or local emergency number (such as 911).</text><text>It is OK to bathe after the liquid adhesive has dried. Try not to scrub the site. Doing so may loosen the seal or even remove the adhesive completely. It is also OK to wash the site with soap and water daily to keep the area clean and prevent infection. Pat the site dry after washing.</text><text>DO NOT use any other ointments on the site of the cut. This will weaken the bond and slow the healing process.</text><text>DO NOT scratch or scrub the site. This will remove the liquid bandage.</text><text>Keep the following in mind:</text><detail>Prevent the wound from reopening by keeping activity to a minimum.</detail><detail>Make sure your hands are clean when you care for the wound.</detail><detail>Take proper care of your wound to help reduce scarring.</detail><detail>Call your provider if you have questions or concerns about how to care for stitches or staples at home.</detail><detail>You can take pain medicine, such as acetaminophen, as directed for pain at the wound site.</detail><detail>Follow-up with your provider to make sure the wound is healing properly.</detail></h2><h2 title="When to Call the Doctor"><text>Call your provider right away if:</text><detail>There is any redness, pain, or yellow pus around the injury. This could mean there is an infection.</detail><detail>There is bleeding at the injury site that will not stop after 10 minutes of direct pressure.</detail><detail>You have new numbness or tingling around the wound area or beyond it.</detail><detail>You have a fever of 100°F (38.3°C) or higher.</detail><detail>There is pain at the site that will not go away, even after taking pain medicine.</detail><detail>The wound has split open. </detail></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>Skin adhesives; Tissue adhesive; Skin cut - liquid bandage; Wound - liquid bandage</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 1/10/2018"><text>Updated by: Jacob L.

<item><title>Morning sickness</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000604.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>
The term "morning sickness" is used to describe nausea and vomiting during pregnancy. Some women also have the symptoms of dizziness and headaches.
</text></h2><h2 title="More About Morning Sickness"><text>Morning sickness often begins 4 to 6 weeks after conception. It may continue until the 4th month of pregnancy. Some women have morning sickness during their entire pregnancy. This happens most often for women who are carrying more than 1 baby.</text><text>It is called morning sickness because the symptoms are more likely to occur early in the day, but they can occur at any time. For some women, morning sickness lasts all day.</text><text>The exact cause of morning sickness is not known.</text><detail>Most experts think changes in the woman's hormone levels during pregnancy cause it.</detail><detail>Other factors that can make the nausea worse include a pregnant woman's enhanced sense of smell and gastric reflux. </detail><text>Morning sickness that is not severe does not hurt your baby in any way. In fact:</text><detail>It may even be a sign that all is well with you and your baby.</detail><detail>Morning sickness may be associated with a lower risk of miscarriage.</detail><detail>Your symptoms probably show that the placenta is making all the right hormones for your growing baby.</detail><text>When nausea and vomiting are severe, a condition known as hyperemesis gravidarum may be diagnosed.</text></h2><h2 title="Eating and Drinking "><text>Changing what you eat may help. Try these tips:</text><detail>Eat a lot of protein and carbohydrates. Try peanut butter on apple slices or celery; nuts; cheese and crackers; and low-fat dairy products like milk, cottage cheese, and yogurt.</detail><detail>Bland foods, such as gelatin, frozen desserts, broth, ginger ale, and saltine crackers, also soothe the stomach.</detail><detail>Avoid eating foods that are high in fat and salt.</detail><detail>Try to eat before you get hungry and before nausea occurs.</detail><detail>Eat a few soda crackers or dry toast when you get up at night to go to the bathroom or before you get out of bed in the morning.</detail><detail>Avoid large meals. Instead, have a snack as often as every 1 to 2 hours during the day. DO NOT let yourself get too hungry or too full.</detail><detail>Drink plenty of liquids.</detail><detail>Try to drink between meals rather than with meals so that your stomach does not get too full.</detail><detail>Seltzer, ginger ale, or other sparkling waters may help control symptoms. </detail><text>Foods that contain ginger may also help. Some of these are ginger tea and ginger candy, along with ginger ale. Check to see that they have ginger in them rather than just ginger flavoring. </text></h2><h2 title="What Else Can I Try?"><text>Try changing how you take your prenatal vitamins.</text><detail>Take them at night, since the iron they contain may irritate your stomach. At night, you might be able to sleep through this. Also take them with a little food, not on an empty stomach.</detail><detail>You may have to try several different brands of prenatal vitamins before finding one you can tolerate.</detail><detail>You can also try cutting your prenatal vitamins in half. Take half in the morning and the other half at night. </detail><text>Some other tips are:</text><detail>Keep your morning activities slow and calm.</detail><detail>Avoid poorly ventilated spaces that trap food odors or other smells.</detail><detail>DO NOT smoke cigarettes or be in areas where people are smoking.</detail><detail>Get extra sleep and try to lessen stress as much as possible. </detail><text>Try acupressure wristbands that apply pressure to specific points on your wrist. Often these are used to ease motion sickness. You can find them at drug stores, health food stores, travel stores, and online.</text><text>Try acupuncture. Some acupuncturists are trained to work with pregnant women. Talk to your health care provider beforehand. </text></h2><h2 title="Are There Any Drugs To Treat Morning Sickness?"><text>Vitamin B6 (100 mg or less daily) has been shown to ease symptoms of morning sickness. Many providers recommend trying it first before trying other medicines.</text><text>There are no drugs currently approved by the Food and Drug Administration to treat morning sickness. Your provider may not advise medicines to prevent nausea unless your vomiting is severe and will not stop.</text><detail>The drug doxylamine (brand name Unisom) may be taken along with vitamin B6 to treat nausea and vomiting. Ask your provider before taking it.</detail><detail>In severe cases, you may be admitted to the hospital, where you will receive fluids through an IV (into your vein).</detail><detail>Your provider might prescribe other medicines if your morning sickness is severe.</detail></h2><h2 title="When to Call the Doctor"><detail>

 
Your morning sickness does not improve after trying home remedies.</detail><detail>You are vomiting blood or something that looks like coffee grounds.</detail><detail>You lose more than 2 pounds (1 kilogram) in a week.</detail><detail>You have severe vomiting that will not stop. This can cause dehydration (not having enough fluid in your body) and malnutrition (not having enough nutrients in your body).

<item><title>Monitoring your baby before labor</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000485.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>While you are pregnant, your health care provider may do tests to check your baby's health. The tests may be done at any time while you are pregnant.</text></h2><h2 title="Tests you may Need Before Labor"><text>Tests may be needed for women who: </text><detail>Have a high-risk pregnancy</detail><detail>Have a health condition, such as diabetes</detail><detail>Have had complications in a prior pregnancy</detail><detail>Have a pregnancy that lasts longer than 40 weeks (overdue) </detail><text>The tests may be done more than once so the provider can track the progress of the baby over time. They will help the provider find problems or things that are not normal (abnormal). Talk to your provider about your tests and the results.</text></h2><h2 title="Non-stress Test (NST)"><text>A healthy baby's heart rate will rise from time to time. During the non-stress test (NST), your provider will watch to see if the baby's heart rate goes faster while resting or moving. You will receive no medicines for this test. </text><text>If the baby's heart rate does not go up on its own, you may be asked to rub your hand over your belly. This may wake up a sleepy baby. A device may also be used to send a noise into your belly. It will not cause any pain.</text><text>You will be hooked up to a fetal monitor, which is a heart monitor for your baby. If the baby's heart rate goes up from time to time, the test results will most likely be normal. NST results that are reactive mean that the baby's heart rate went up normally. </text><text>Non-reactive results mean that the baby's heart rate did not go up enough. If the heart rate does not go up enough, you may need more tests.</text><text>Another term you might hear for this test result is a categorization of 1, 2, or 3.</text><detail>Category 1 means the result is normal.</detail><detail>Category 2 means further observation or testing is necessary.</detail><detail>Category 3 typically means your doctor will recommend delivery right away. </detail></h2><h2 title="Contraction Stress Test (CST)"><text>If the NST results are not normal, you may need a CST. This test will help the provider know how well the baby will do during labor.</text><text>Labor is stressful for a baby. Every contraction means the baby gets less blood and oxygen for a short while. For most babies this is not a problem. But some babies have a hard time. A CST shows how the baby's heart rate reacts to the stress of contractions.</text><text>A fetal monitor will be used. You will be given oxytocin (Pitocin), a hormone that makes the uterus contract. The contractions will be like the ones you will have during labor, only milder. If the baby's heart rate slows down rather than speeds up after a contraction, the baby may have problems during labor.</text><text>Most women feel mild discomfort during this test, but not pain.</text><text>If the results are abnormal, your doctor may admit you to the hospital to deliver the baby early.</text></h2><h2 title="Biophysical Profile (BPP)"><text>A BPP is a NST with an ultrasound. If the NST results are not reactive, a BPP may be done.</text><text>The BPP looks at the baby's movement, body tone, breathing, and the results of the NST. The BPP also looks at amniotic fluid, which is the liquid that surrounds the baby in the uterus.</text><text>The BPP test results can be normal, abnormal, or unclear. If the results are unclear, you may need to repeat the test. Results that are not normal may mean that the baby needs to be delivered early.</text></h2><h2 title="Modified Biophysical Profile (MBPP)"><text>A MBPP is also a NST with an ultrasound. The ultrasound looks only at how much amniotic fluid there is. The MBPP test takes less time than a BPP. Your doctor may feel that the MBPP test will be enough to check the baby's health, without doing a full BPP.</text><text>In a healthy pregnancy, these tests may not be done. But you may need some of these tests if:</text><detail>You have medical problems</detail><detail>You have the potential for pregnancy problems (high risk pregnancy)</detail><detail>You have gone a week or more past your due date </detail><text>Talk to your provider about the tests and what the results mean for you and your baby.</text></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>Prenatal care - monitoring; Pregnancy care - monitoring; Non-stress test - monitoring; NST- monitoring; Contraction stress test - monitoring; CST- monitoring; Biophysical profile - monitoring; BPP - monitoring</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 4/19/2018"><text>Updated by: John D.

If the burn is caused by chemicals, take off all clothes that have the chemical on them.</text><text>Cool the burn:</text><detail>Use cool water, not ice. The extreme cold from ice can injure the tissue even more.</detail><detail>If possible, especially if the burn is caused by chemicals, hold the burned skin under cool running water for 10 to 15 minutes until it does not hurt as much. Use a sink, shower, or garden hose.</detail><detail>If this is not possible, put a cool, clean wet cloth on the burn, or soak the burn in a cool water bath for 5 minutes.</detail></h2><h2 title="Caring for Burns"><text>After the burn is cooled, make sure it is a minor burn. If it is deeper, larger, or on the hand, foot, face, groin, buttocks, hip, knee, ankle, shoulder, elbow, or wrist, seek medical care right away.</text><text>If it is a minor burn:</text><detail>Clean the burn gently with soap and water.</detail><detail>DO NOT break blisters. An opened blister can get infected.</detail><detail>You may put a thin layer of ointment, such as petroleum jelly or aloe vera, on the burn. The ointment does not need to have antibiotics in it. Some antibiotic ointments can cause an allergic reaction. DO NOT use cream, lotion, oil, cortisone, butter, or egg white.</detail><detail>If needed, protect the burn from rubbing and pressure with a sterile non-stick gauze (petrolatum or Adaptic-type) lightly taped or wrapped over it. DO NOT use a dressing that can shed fibers, because they can get caught in the burn. Change the dressing once a day.</detail><detail>For pain, take an over-the-counter pain medicine. These include acetaminophen (such as Tylenol), ibuprofen (such as Advil or Motrin), naproxen (such as Aleve), and aspirin. Follow the directions on the bottle. DO NOT give aspirin to children under 2, or anyone 18 or younger who has or is recovering from chickenpox or flu symptoms. </detail></h2><h2 title="What to Expect"><text>Minor burns could take up to 3 weeks to heal.</text><text>A burn can itch as it heals. DO NOT scratch it.</text><text>The deeper the burn, the more likely it is to scar. If the burn appears to be developing a scar, call your doctor for advice. </text></h2><h2 title="When to Call the Doctor"><text>Burns are susceptible to tetanus. This means tetanus bacteria can enter your body through the burn. If your last tetanus shot was more than 5 years ago, call your doctor. You may need a booster shot.</text><text>Call your doctor if you have signs of infection:</text><detail>Increased pain</detail><detail>Redness</detail><detail>Swelling</detail><detail>Oozing or pus</detail><detail>Fever</detail><detail>Swollen lymph nodes</detail><detail>Red streak from the burn </detail></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>

It causes fever, coughing, and shortness of breath. About 30% of people who have gotten this illness have died. Some people only have mild symptoms.</text><text>MERS is caused by the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV). It was first reported in Saudi Arabia in 2012 and then spread to many countries. Most cases were spread from people who traveled to the Middle Eastern countries</text><text>To date, there have only been 2 cases of MERS in the United States. They were in people traveling to the United States from Saudi Arabia and diagnosed in 2014. The virus poses a very low risk to people in the United States.</text></h2><h2 title="How MERS Spreads"><text>No one knows exactly where the MERS virus comes from. It has also been found in camels and in one bat. While it is believed to come from animals, that is still unclear.</text><text>The virus can spread between people in close contact. This includes health care workers who care for people with MERS.</text><text>The incubation period of this virus is not precisely known. This is the amount of time between when a person is exposed to the virus and when symptoms occur. In the first cases, the average incubation period seemed to be 5 days, but there are cases that occurred up to 14 days after exposure.</text></h2><h2 title="MERS Symptoms"><text>The most common symptoms have included fever, chills, and cough. Less common symptoms include coughing up blood, diarrhea, and vomiting. However, these symptoms can also occur in a number of other conditions.</text><text>All people with MERS had an abnormal chest x-ray.</text><text>Right now, there is no vaccine for MERS and no specific treatment. Supportive care is given.</text></h2><h2 title="Steps to Help Prevent MERS"><text>If you plan to travel to one of the countries where MERS is present, the Centers for Disease Control Prevention (CDC) advises taking the following steps to prevent illness.</text><detail>Wash your hands often with soap and water for 20 seconds. Help young children do the same. If soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer.</detail><detail>Cover your nose and mouth with a tissue when you cough or sneeze then throw the tissue in the trash.</detail><detail>Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.</detail><detail>Avoid close contact, such as kissing, sharing cups, or sharing eating utensils, with sick people.</detail><detail>Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces, such as toys and doorknobs.</detail><detail>If you come in contact with animals, such as camels, wash your hands thoroughly afterward.

<item><title>Ménière disease - self-care</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000709.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>You have seen your doctor for Ménière disease. During Ménière attacks, you may have vertigo, or the feeling that you are spinning. You may also have hearing loss (most often in one ear) and ringing or roaring in the affected ear, called tinnitus. You may also have pressure or fullness in the ears.</text><text>During attacks, some people find bed rest helps relieve vertigo symptoms. Your health care provider may prescribe medicines like diuretics (water pills) or antihistamines to help. Surgery may be used in some cases with persistent symptoms, although this has risks and is rarely recommended.</text><text>There is no cure for Ménière disease. However, making some lifestyle changes can help prevent or reduce attacks.</text></h2><h2 title="Diet"><text>Eating a low-salt (sodium) diet helps reduce the fluid pressure in your inner ear. This can help control symptoms of Ménière disease. Your provider may recommend cutting back to 1,500 mg to 2,000 mg of sodium per day. This is about ¾ teaspoon (4 grams) of salt.</text><text>Start by taking the salt shaker off your table, and do not add any extra salt to foods. You get plenty from the food you eat.</text><text>These tips can help you cut the extra salt from your diet.</text><text>When shopping, look for healthy choices that are naturally low in salt, including:</text><detail>Fresh or frozen vegetables and fruits.</detail><detail>Fresh or frozen beef, chicken, turkey, and fish. Note that salt is often added to whole turkeys, so be sure to read the label.</detail><text>Learn to read labels.</text><detail>Check all labels to see how much salt is in each serving of your food. A product with less than 100 mg of salt per serving is good.</detail><detail>Ingredients are listed in order of the amount the food contains. Avoid foods that list salt near the top of the list of ingredients.</detail><detail>Look for these words: low-sodium, sodium-free, no salt added, sodium-reduced, or unsalted.</detail><text>Foods to avoid include:</text><detail>Most canned foods, unless the label says low or no sodium. Canned foods often contain salt to preserve the color of the food and keep it looking fresh.</detail><detail>Processed foods, such as cured or smoked meats, bacon, hot dogs, sausage, bologna, ham, and salami.</detail><detail>Packaged foods such as macaroni and cheese and rice mixes.</detail><detail>Anchovies, olives, pickles, and sauerkraut.</detail><detail>Soy and Worcestershire sauces.</detail><detail>Tomato and other vegetable juices.</detail><detail>Most cheeses.</detail><detail>Many bottled salad dressings and salad dressing mixes.</detail><detail>Most snack foods, such as chips or crackers.</detail><text>When you cook and eat at home:</text><detail>Replace salt with other seasonings. Pepper, garlic, herbs, and lemon are good choices.</detail><detail>Avoid packaged spice blends. They often contain salt.</detail><detail>Use garlic and onion powder, not garlic and onion salt.</detail><detail>DO NOT eat foods containing monosodium glutamate (MSG).</detail><detail>Replace your salt shaker with a salt-free seasoning mix.</detail><detail>Use oil and vinegar on salads. Add fresh or dried herbs.</detail><detail>Eat fresh fruit or sorbet for dessert.</detail><text>When you go out to eat:</text><detail>Stick to steamed, grilled, baked, boiled, and broiled foods with no added salt, sauces, or cheese.</detail><detail>If you think the restaurant might use MSG, ask them not to add it to your order.</detail><text>Try to eat the same amount of food and drink the same amount of fluid at about the same time every day. This can help reduce changes in the fluid balance in your ear.</text></h2><h2 title="Other Lifestyle Changes"><text>Making the following changes may also help:</text><detail>Some over-the-counter medicines, such as antacids and laxatives, have a lot of salt in them. If you need these medicines, ask your provider or pharmacist what brands contain little or no salt.</detail><detail>Home water softeners add salt to water. If you have one, limit how much tap water you drink. Drink bottled water instead.</detail><detail>Avoid caffeine and alcohol, which may make symptoms worse.</detail><detail>If you smoke, quit. Quitting may help reduce symptoms.</detail><detail>Some people find that managing allergy symptoms and avoiding allergy triggers helps decrease Meniere disease symptoms.</detail><detail>Get plenty of sleep and take steps to reduce stress. </detail></h2><h2 title="Medicines"><text>For some people, diet alone will not be enough. If needed, your provider may also give you water pills (diuretics) to help reduce the fluid in your body and fluid pressure in your inner ear. You should have regular follow-up exams and lab work as suggested by your provider. Antihistamines may also be prescribed. These medicines may make you sleepy, so you should first take them when you do not have to drive or be alert for important tasks.</text></h2><h2 title="Surgery"><text>If surgery is recommended for your condition, be sure to talk with your surgeon about any specific restrictions you may have after surgery. </text></h2><h2 title="When to Call your Doctor"><text>Call your provider if you have symptoms of Ménière disease, or if symptoms get worse.

Medicines can help manage your symptoms so that you can continue to lead an active life. Talk to your health care provider about medicines that are right for you. </text></h2><h2 title="Over-the-counter Pain Relievers"><text>Over-the-counter pain relievers can help with your arthritis symptoms. "Over-the-counter" means you can buy these medicines without a prescription.</text><text>Most doctors recommend acetaminophen (such as Tylenol) first. It has fewer side effects than other drugs. DO NOT take more than 3 grams (3,000 mg) a day. If you have liver problems, talk to your doctor first about how much acetaminophen is right for you.</text><text>If your pain continues, your doctor may suggest non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Types of NSAIDs include aspirin, ibuprofen, and naproxen.</text><text>Taking acetaminophen or another pain pill before exercising is OK. But DO NOT overdo the exercise because you have taken medicine.</text><text>Both NSAIDs and acetaminophen in high doses, or taken for a long time, can cause serious side effects. If you are taking pain relievers on most days, tell your provider. You may need to be watched for side effects. Your provider may want to monitor you with certain blood tests.</text><text>Capsaicin (Zostrix) is a skin cream that may help relieve pain. You may feel a warm, stinging sensation when you first apply the cream. This sensation goes away after a few days of use. Pain relief usually begins within 1 to 2 weeks.</text><text>NSAIDs in the form of skin cream are available over-the-counter or by prescription. Ask your provider if these might be right for you.</text></h2><h2 title="Steroid Shots for Arthritis"><text>Medicine called corticosteroids can be injected into the joint to help with swelling and pain. Relief can last for months. More than 2 or 3 shots a year may be harmful. These shots are usually done at your doctor's office.</text><text>When the pain seems to go away after these injections, it may be tempting to go back to activities that may have caused your pain. When you receive these injections, ask your doctor or physical therapist to give you exercises and stretches that will decrease the chance of your pain returning.</text></h2><h2 title="Other Shots for Knee Arthritis"><text>Hyaluronic acid is a substance already in the fluid of your knee. It helps lubricate the joint. When you have arthritis, the hyaluronic acid in your joint becomes thinner and less effective.</text><text>Your doctor can inject a form of hyaluronic acid into your joint to help lubricate and protect it. This is sometimes called artificial joint fluid, or viscosupplementation.</text><text>These injections cannot help everyone. If they do help, relief may last 3 to 6 months. Hyaluronic acid use is approved only for knee arthritis.</text></h2><h2 title="Supplements"><text>The body naturally makes both glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate. They are important for healthy cartilage in your joints. These two substances come in supplement form and can be bought over-the-counter.</text><text>Glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate supplements may help control pain. But they do not seem to help the joint grow new cartilage or keep arthritis from getting worse. Some doctors recommend a trial period of 3 months to see whether glucosamine and chondroitin help.</text><text>S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe, pronounced "sammy") is a man-made form of a natural chemical in the body. Claims that SAMe can help arthritis are not well proven.</text></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>Arthritis - medications; Arthritis - steroid injections; Arthritis - supplements; Arthritis - hyaluronic acid</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 9/7/2017"><text>Updated by: C.

These medicines make the bones in your hips, spine, and other areas less likely to break. </text><text>Your doctor may prescribe medicines when: </text><detail>A bone density test shows you have osteoporosis, even if you have not had a fracture before, but your fracture risk is high.</detail><detail>You have a bone fracture, and a bone density test shows you have thinner than normal bones, but not osteoporosis.</detail><detail>You have a bone fracture that occurs without any significant injury. </detail></h2><h2 title="Bisphosphonates"><text>Bisphosphonates are the main medicines that are used to both prevent and treat bone loss. They are most often taken by mouth. You may take a pill either once a week or once a month. You also may get bisphosphonates through a vein (IV). Most often this is done once or twice a year.</text><text>Common side effects with bisphosphonates taken by mouth are heartburn, nausea, and pain in the belly. When you take bisphosphonates:</text><detail>Take them on an empty stomach in the morning with 6 to 8 ounces (oz), or 177 to 236 milliliters (mL), of plain water (not carbonated water or juice).</detail><detail>After taking the pill, remain sitting or standing for at least 30 minutes.</detail><detail>DO NOT eat or drink for at least 30 to 60 minutes. </detail><text>Rare side effects are:</text><detail>Low blood calcium level</detail><detail>A certain type of leg-bone fracture</detail><detail>Damage to the jaw bone</detail><detail>Fast, abnormal heartbeat (atrial fibrillation) </detail><text>Your doctor may have you stop taking this medicine after about 5 years. Doing so decreases the risk of certain side effects. This is called a drug holiday.</text></h2><h2 title="Other Drugs for Osteoporosis"><text>Raloxifene (Evista) may also be used to prevent and treat osteoporosis.</text><detail>It can reduce the risk of spinal fractures, but not other types of fractures.</detail><detail>The most serious side effect is a very small risk of blood clots in the leg veins or in the lungs.</detail><detail>This drug may also help decrease the risk of heart disease and breast cancer.</detail><detail>Other selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) are also used to treat osteoporosis. </detail><text>Denosumab (Prolia) is a medicine that prevents bones from becoming more fragile. This medicine:</text><detail>Is given as an injection every 6 months.</detail><detail>May increase bone density more than bisphosphonates.</detail><detail>Is generally not a first-line treatment.</detail><detail>May not be a good choice for people who have weak immune systems or who take medicines that affect the immune system. </detail><text>Teriparatide (Forteo) is a bio-engineered form of parathyroid hormone. This medicine:</text><detail>May increase bone density and decrease the risk for fractures.</detail><detail>Is given as an injection underneath the skin at home, often every day.</detail><detail>Does not seem to have severe long-term side effects, but may cause nausea, dizziness, or leg cramps. </detail><text>Estrogen, or hormone replacement therapy (HRT). This medicine:</text><detail>Is very effective in preventing and treating osteoporosis.</detail><detail>Was the most commonly used osteoporosis medication for many years. Its use decreased because of concern that this medicine caused heart disease, breast cancer, and blood clots.</detail><detail>Is still a good option for many younger women (50 to 60 years old). If a woman is taking estrogen already, she and her doctor must discuss the risks and benefits of doing so. </detail><text>Parathyroid hormone.</text><detail>This medicine is given as daily shots under the skin.

A mistake could cause a problem for you. The process is as follows:</text><detail>Your doctor writes an order in your medical record for your medicine. This prescription goes to the hospital pharmacy.</detail><detail>The hospital pharmacist reads and fills the prescription. The medicine is labeled with the type of medicine and your name, and then sent to your nurse.</detail><detail>Your nurse reads the prescription label and gives you the medicine. This is called administering the medicine.</detail><detail>Your nurse and the rest of your health care team monitor (watch) you to see how you respond to the medicine. They watch to make sure the medicine is working. They also look for side effects the medicine could cause. </detail></h2><h2 title="Filling Your Prescriptions"><text>The pharmacy may receive some prescriptions by computer (electronic) and some that are handwritten. Electronic prescriptions are easier to read than handwritten prescriptions. This means there is less chance of a medicine error with electronic prescriptions.</text><text>Your doctor can tell your nurse to write down a prescription for you. Then your nurse can send the prescription to the pharmacy. This is called a verbal order. Your nurse should repeat the prescription back to your doctor to make sure it is right before sending it to the pharmacy.</text><text>Your doctor, nurse, and pharmacist will check to make sure any new medicines you receive do not cause a bad reaction with other medicines you are already taking.</text></h2><h2 title="The Rights of Medication Administration"><text>The Rights of Medication Administration is a checklist nurses use to make sure you get the right medicine. The rights are as follows:</text><detail>Right medicine (Is the right medicine being given?)</detail><detail>Right dose (Is the amount and strength of the medicine correct?)</detail><detail>Right patient (Is the medicine being given to the right patient?)</detail><detail>Right time (Is it the right time to give the medicine?)</detail><detail>Right route (Is the medicine being given the right way? It may be given by mouth, through a vein, on your skin, or another way.)</detail><detail>Right documentation (After giving the medicine, did the nurse make a record of it? The time, the route, dose, and other specific information about the medicine should be documented.)</detail><detail>Right reason (Is the medicine being given for the problem it has been prescribed for?)</detail><detail>Right response (Is the drug providing the desire effect? For example, after being given a blood pressure drug, does a patient's blood pressure actually go down?) </detail></h2><h2 title="Tips to Stay Safe"><text>You can help make sure you get the right medicine the right way during your hospital stay by doing the following:</text><detail>Tell your nurse and other health care providers about any allergies or side effects you have had to any medicines in the past.</detail><detail>Make sure your nurse and doctor know all the medicines, supplements, and herbs you were taking before you came to the hospital. Bring a list of all these with you. It is a good idea to keep this list in your wallet and with you at all times.</detail><detail>While you are in the hospital, do not take medicines you brought from home unless your doctor tells you it is OK. Make sure to tell your nurse if you take your own medicine.</detail><detail>Ask what each medicine is for. Also ask what side effects to watch for and tell your nurse about.</detail><detail>Know the names of the medicines you get and what times you should get them in the hospital.</detail><detail>Ask your nurse to tell you what medicines they are giving you. Keep a list of what medicines you get and what times you got them. Speak up if you think you are getting the wrong medicine or getting a medicine at the wrong time.</detail><detail>Any container that has medicine in it should have a label with the name of the medicine on it. This includes all syringes, tubes, bags, and pill bottles. If you do not see a label, ask your nurse what the medicine is.</detail><detail>Ask your nurse if you are taking any high-alert medicine. These are medicines that can cause harm if they are not given the right way, even if they are used for the right purpose. High-alert medicines include blood thinners, insulin, and narcotic pain medicines. Ask what extra safety steps are being taken if you are taking a high-alert medicine. </detail></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>Medication safety - hospital; Five rights - medication; Medication administration - hospital; Medical errors - medication; Patient safety - medication safety</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 2/18/2018"><text>Updated by: Laura J.

If you take the wrong medicine or too much of it, it could cause serious problems.</text><text>Take these steps when getting and filling your prescriptions in order to avoid medicine errors.</text></h2><h2 title="Getting a Prescription"><text>Every time you get a new prescription, make sure you:</text><detail>Tell your health care provider about any allergies or side effects, you have had to any medicines in the past.</detail><detail>Tell all your providers about all the medicines, supplements, and herbs you take. Bring a list of all these with you to your appointments. Keep this list in your wallet and with you at all times.</detail><detail>Ask what each medicine is for and what side effects to watch for.</detail><detail>Ask whether the medicine will interact with any foods, drinks, or other medicines.</detail><detail>Ask your provider what to do if you forget a dose.</detail><detail>Learn the names of all your medicines. Also learn what each medicine looks like. </detail></h2><h2 title="Filling Your Prescriptions"><text>Your health plan may require you to use certain pharmacies. This means they may not pay for your prescription if you do not use one of their pharmacies. Check with your health plan about which pharmacies you can use. You may have the option to buy your medicines in one or more ways:</text><text>LOCAL PHARMACIES</text><text>Many people use their local pharmacist. One advantage is that you can talk with someone if you have any questions. They can also get to know you and the medicines you take. To help your pharmacist fill your prescription:</text><detail>Make sure all the information is filled in clearly.</detail><detail>Bring your insurance card the first time you fill a prescription.</detail><detail>When calling the pharmacy for a refill, make sure to give your name, the prescription number, and the name of the medicine.</detail><detail>It is best to fill all your prescriptions with the same pharmacy.

There are scam sites that sell fake drugs for cheap.</text><detail>Look for the Verified Internet Pharmacy Practice Sites seal (VIPPS) from the National Association of Boards of Pharmacy. This seal means the pharmacy has been accredited and meets certain standards.</detail><detail>The website should have clear directions for filling or transferring your prescription.</detail><detail>Make sure the website has clearly-stated privacy policies and other procedures.</detail><detail>NEVER USE any website that claims a provider can prescribe the medicine without seeing you.</detail><detail>Make sure your health plan will cover the cost of using the online pharmacy. </detail></h2><h2 title="Tips to Stay Safe"><text>When you receive your prescription, always:</text><detail>Check the label. Look for your name, the name of the medicine, the dose, and how often you should take it. If something looks unfamiliar, call your provider.</detail><detail>Look at the medicine. Make sure it looks the same as what you have been taking. If it does not, call the pharmacist or your provider. It may look different because it is a generic version or a different brand.

<item><title>Medical marijuana</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000899.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>Marijuana is best known as a drug that people smoke or eat to get high. It is derived from the plant Cannabis sativa. Possession of marijuana is illegal under federal law. Medical marijuana refers to using marijuana to treat certain medical conditions. In the United States, about half of the states have legalized marijuana for medical use.</text></h2><h2 title="How Does Medical Marijuana Work?"><text>Medical marijuana may be:</text><detail>Smoked</detail><detail>Vaporized</detail><detail>Eaten</detail><detail>Taken as a liquid extract </detail><text>Marijuana leaves and buds contain substances called cannabinoids. THC is a cannabinoid that can affect the brain and change your mood or consciousness. </text><text>Different varieties of marijuana contain different amounts of cannabinoids. This sometimes makes the effects of medical marijuana hard to predict or control. The effects also may differ depending on whether it is smoked or eaten. </text></h2><h2 title="What Conditions can it Help?"><text>Medical marijuana may be used to:</text><detail>Ease pain. This includes different types of chronic pain, including pain from nerve damage.</detail><detail>Control nausea and vomiting. The most common use is for nausea and vomiting caused by chemotherapy for cancer.</detail><detail>Make a person feel like eating. This helps people who do not eat enough and lose weight due to other illnesses, such as HIV/AIDS and cancer. </detail><text>Some small studies show that marijuana might relieve symptoms in people who have:</text><detail>Multiple sclerosis</detail><detail>Crohn disease</detail><detail>Inflammatory bowel disease</detail><detail>Epilepsy </detail><text>Smoking marijuana lowers pressure inside the eyes, a problem linked to glaucoma. But the effect does not last long. Other glaucoma medicines may work better to treat the disease.</text></h2><h2 title="How do People get Medical Marijuana?"><text>In states where medical marijuana is legal, you need a written statement from your health care provider to get the drug. It must explain that you need it to treat a medical condition or to ease side effects. Your name will be put on a list that lets you buy marijuana from an authorized seller.</text></h2><h2 title="What Medical Conditions Qualify?"><text>You can only get medical marijuana if you have certain conditions. The conditions marijuana can treat varies from state to state. The most common ones include:</text><detail>Cancer</detail><detail>HIV/AIDS</detail><detail>Seizures and epilepsy</detail><detail>Glaucoma</detail><detail>Severe chronic pain</detail><detail>Severe nausea</detail><detail>Extreme weight loss and weakness (wasting syndrome)</detail><detail>Severe muscle spasms</detail><detail>Multiple sclerosis </detail></h2><h2 title="Side Effects"><text>Possible physical symptoms from using marijuana include:</text><detail>A fast or irregular heartbeat</detail><detail>Dizziness</detail><detail>Slow reaction times</detail><detail>Drowsiness</detail><text>Possible mental or emotional side effects include:</text><detail>A strong feeling of happiness or well-being</detail><detail>Short-term memory loss</detail><detail>Trouble concentrating</detail><detail>Confusion</detail><detail>Decreased or increased anxiety </detail></h2><h2 title="Who Should not use Medical Marijuana? "><text>Providers are not allowed to prescribe medical marijuana to people younger than age 18. Other people who should not use medical marijuana include:</text><detail>People with heart disease</detail><detail>Pregnant women</detail><detail>People with a history of psychosis </detail><text>Other concerns linked to marijuana use include:</text><detail>Dangerous driving or other risky behaviors</detail><detail>Lung irritation</detail><detail>Dependence or addiction to marijuana </detail></h2><h2 title="Prescription Drugs Based on Marijuana Compounds"><text>The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved marijuana for treating any health conditions.</text><text>However, the FDA has approved two prescription medicines that contain man-made cannabinoids. </text><detail>Dronabinol (Marinol). This drug treats nausea and vomiting caused by chemotherapy and loss of appetite and weight loss in people with HIV/AIDS.</detail><detail>Nabilone (Cesamet). This drug treats nausea and vomiting caused by chemotherapy in people who have not had relief from other treatments. </detail><text>Unlike medical marijuana, the active ingredient in these drugs can be controlled, so you always know how much you get in a dose.</text></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>Pot; Grass; Cannabis; Weed; Hash; Ganja</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 10/8/2017"><text>Updated by: Linda J.

<item><title>Maximizing your teaching moment</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000460.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>When you have assessed the patient's needs and selected the education materials and methods you will use, you will need to:</text><detail>Set up a good learning environment. This may include things such as adjusting the lighting to ensuring that the patient has the needed amount of privacy.</detail><detail>Pay attention to your own demeanor. This includes adopting the right tone of voice and making the appropriate amount of eye contact (based on cultural needs). It is also important to refrain from judgment and not rushing the patient.</detail><detail>Keep assessing your patient's concerns and readiness to learn. Continue to listen well and read the patient's verbal and non-verbal signals.</detail><detail>Break through barriers. These may include feelings such as anger, denial, anxiety, or depression; beliefs and attitudes that are not aligned with learning; pain; acute illness; language or cultural differences; physical limitations; and learning differences. </detail></h2><h2 title="Partner with Your Patients"><text>Try to involve the patient and support person when appropriate as partners in the health care team. The information and skills the patient learns will enhance the ability to make the best personal health choices.</text><text>Help the patient learn how to talk about personal health and medical issues and discuss what is needed to help manage the current condition and feel better. When the patient knows what to report, what to focus on, and how to ask questions when talking with a health care provider, he or she can become a more active partner in care.</text></h2><h2 title="Make the Most of the Moment"><text>After you develop your plan you are ready to begin teaching.</text><text>Keep in mind you will get the best results when you are meeting the patient's needs. This includes selecting the right time -- that teachable moment. If you teach only at a time that fits your schedule, your efforts may not be as effective.</text><text>It is unlikely that you will even have all the time you would like for patient teaching. It may help to give your patient written or audiovisual resources before your meeting. This may help reduce the patient's anxiety and save you time. The option of providing resources ahead of time will depend on your patient's needs and the resources you have available.</text><text>Talk about all the topics that will be covered and set time frames. For example, you may say, "Over the next few days or visits we will cover these 5 topics, and we will start with this one." Your patient may agree, or the patient may express a strong desire to go out of order, based on a perceived or real concern.</text><text>Deliver patient teaching in small chunks. Avoid overloading your patient. If your patient is willing to try only 2 of the 4 lifestyle changes you suggest, leave the door open for further talks about the other changes.</text><text>If you are teaching certain skills to your patient, check for the patient's mastery of the first skill before you move on to the next one. And stay alert to barriers your patient may face in at home. </text><text>Talk about what to do if the patient's condition changes. This will help the patient feel more in control and feel a greater partnership in their own health care process.</text><text>Lastly, remember that small steps are better than none.</text></h2><h2 title="Teach-Back or Return Demonstrations"><text>When teaching a new skill, ask your patient to demonstrate the new skill so you assess understanding and mastery.</text><text>Use the teach-back method to evaluate how you are doing as a teacher. This method is also called the show-me method, or closing the loop. It is a way to confirm that you have explained to your patient what they need to know in an understandable way. This method can also help you identify the strategies that are most helpful for patient understanding.</text><text>Keep in mind that teach-back is not a test of the patient's knowledge. It is a test of how well you explained or taught the information or skill. Use teach-back with every patient -- the one you feel certain has understood as well as the patient who appears to be struggling.</text></h2><h2 title="Reinforce Learning"><text>As you are teaching, provide reinforcement for learning.</text><detail>Reinforce your patient's effort to learn.</detail><detail>Acknowledge when your patient has overcome a challenge.</detail><detail>Offer hints, tips, and strategies that you have gathered from other patients.</detail><detail>Let your patients know who they can call if questions or concerns come up later.</detail><detail>Share a list of trusted websites, and provide referrals to organizations, support groups, or other resources.</detail><detail>Review what you have covered, and always ask if your patient has other questions. Asking the patient to convey specific areas where there may still be questions will give you more information that merely asking "Do you have any other questions?" </detail></h2><h2 title="Review Date 11/20/2017"><text>Updated by: Laura J.

<item><title>Mastectomy - discharge </title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000244.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>You had a mastectomy. This is surgery that removes the entire breast. The surgery was done to treat or prevent breast cancer.</text><text>Now that you're going home, follow the surgeon's instructions on how to care for yourself at home.</text></h2><h2 title="When You're in the Hospital"><text>Your surgery was one of these:</text><detail>For a nipple-sparing mastectomy, the surgeon removed the entire breast and left the nipple and areola (the pigmented circle around the nipple) in place. The surgeon may have done a biopsy of nearby lymph nodes to see if the cancer spread.</detail><detail>For a skin-sparing mastectomy, the surgeon removed the entire breast along with the nipple and areola, but removed very little skin. The surgeon may have done a biopsy of nearby lymph nodes to see if the cancer spread.</detail><detail>For a total or simple mastectomy, the surgeon removed the entire breast along with the nipple and areola. The surgeon may have done a biopsy of nearby lymph nodes to see if the cancer spread.</detail><detail>For a modified radical mastectomy, the surgeon removed the entire breast and the lower level lymph nodes under your arm. </detail><text>You may have also had breast reconstruction surgery with implants or natural tissue.</text></h2><h2 title="What to Expect at Home"><text>Full recovery may take 4 to 8 weeks. You may have shoulder, chest, and arm stiffness. This stiffness gets better over time and can be helped with physical therapy.</text><text>You may have swelling in the arm on the side of your surgery. This swelling is called lymphedema. The swelling usually occurs much later and it can be a problem that lasts. It can also be treated with physical therapy.</text><text>You may go home with drains in your chest to remove extra fluid. Your surgeon will decide when to remove these drains, usually in a week or two.</text><text>You may need time to adjust to losing your breast. Talking to other women who have had mastectomies can help you deal with these feelings. Ask your health care provider about local support groups. Counseling can help as well.</text></h2><h2 title="Activity"><text>You can do whatever activity you want as long as it does not cause pain or discomfort. You should be able to resume your usual activities in a few weeks.</text><text>It is OK to use your arm on the side of your surgery.</text><detail>Your provider or physical therapist can show you some simple exercises to relieve tightness. Do only the exercises they show you.</detail><detail>You may drive only if you are not taking pain medicines and you can easily turn the steering wheel without pain. </detail><text>Ask your surgeon when you can return to work. When and what you can do depends on your type of work and whether you also had a lymph node biopsy.</text><text>Ask your surgeon or nurse about using post-mastectomy products, such as a mastectomy bra or a camisole with drain pockets. These can be bought in drug stores and on the internet. </text></h2><h2 title="Wound Care"><text>You may still have drains in your chest when you go home from the hospital. You will need to empty and measure how much fluid drains from them. </text><text>Stitches are often placed under the skin and dissolve on their own. If your surgeon used clips, you will go back to the doctor to have them removed. This usually takes place 7 to 10 days after surgery.</text><text>Care for your wound as instructed. Instructions may include:</text><detail>If you have a dressing, change it every day until your doctor says you do not need to.</detail><detail>Wash the wound area with mild soap and water.</detail><detail>You may shower but DO NOT scrub the strips of surgical tape or surgical glue. Let them fall off on their own.</detail><detail>DO NOT sit in a bathtub, pool, or hot tub until your doctor tells you it is OK.</detail><detail>You may shower after all of your dressings have been removed. </detail></h2><h2 title="Managing Your Pain"><text>Your surgeon will give you a prescription for pain medicines. Get it filled right away so you have it available when you go home. Remember to take your pain medicine before your pain gets severe.</text><text>Try using an ice pack on your chest and armpit if you have pain or swelling. Do this only if your surgeon says it is OK. Wrap the ice pack in a towel before applying it. This prevents cold injury of your skin. DO NOT use the ice pack for more than 15 minutes at a time.</text></h2><h2 title="Follow-up"><text>Your surgeon will tell you when you need to have your next visit. You may also need appointments to talk about more treatment, such as chemotherapy, radiation, or hormonal therapy.</text></h2><h2 title="When to Call the Surgeon"><text>Call if:</text><detail>Your temperature is 101.5°F (38.6°C), or higher.</detail><detail>You have swelling of the arm on the side you had surgery (lymphedema).</detail><detail>Your surgical wounds are bleeding, are red or warm to the touch, or have a thick, yellow, green, or milky drainage.</detail><detail>You have pain that is not helped with your pain medicines.</detail><detail>It is hard to breathe.</detail><detail>You have a cough that does not go away.</detail><detail>You cannot drink or eat. </detail></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>Breast removal surgery - discharge; Nipple-sparing mastectomy - discharge; Total mastectomy - discharge; Simple mastectomy - discharge; Modified radical mastectomy - discharge; Breast cancer - mastectomy -discharge</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 2/11/2017"><text>Updated by: Debra G.

This article offers advice on making good food choices to manage your weight.</text></h2><h2 title="A Balanced Diet"><text>For a balanced diet, you need the right types and amounts of foods and drinks. This keeps your body healthy.</text><text>Know how many calories your body needs every day. A dietitian can help you determine your caloric needs based on your: </text><detail>Age</detail><detail>Sex</detail><detail>Size</detail><detail>Activity level</detail><detail>Medical conditions </detail><text>Know how many servings of dairy, fruits and vegetables, proteins, and grains and other starches your body needs each day. </text><text>A balanced diet also includes avoiding too much of some foods and making sure you get enough of others. </text><text>Stock up on healthy foods such as fresh produce, lean proteins, low-fat dairy, and whole grains. Limit foods like chips and candy and other empty calories. These include foods that are low in healthy nutrients and high in sugar, fat, and calories. Eat healthy snacks instead, like carrots and bell peppers with hummus, an apple and a piece of string cheese, or yogurt with fresh fruit. </text><text>Choose different healthy foods from each food group. Eat foods from each group with every meal. Whenever you sit down to a meal, green vegetables should take up half of your plate.</text><h3 title="Protein (meats and beans)"><text>Avoid the fried options; baked, steamed, grilled, stewed, or broiled is better.</text><text>Good sources of lean protein include white meat turkey and chicken with the skin removed. Buffalo meat is also good.</text><text>Eat lean cuts of beef or pork. Trim away any visible fat.</text><text>Eat plenty of fish, such as salmon and sardines, at least 2 times per week. Limit varieties that are high in mercury, such as: </text><detail>Shark</detail><detail>Swordfish</detail><detail>Tile fish</detail><detail>King mackerel </detail><text>Also limit red snapper and tuna to once a week or less.</text><text>Beans are good sources of protein and fiber, including: </text><detail>Pinto beans</detail><detail>Black beans</detail><detail>Kidney beans</detail><detail>Lentils</detail><detail>Split peas</detail><detail>Garbanzo beans </detail><text>Nuts and seeds are part of a balanced diet. You can also eat tofu, tempeh, and other soy products.</text><text>Eggs are also a good source of protein. For most healthy people, it is fine to eat 1 to 2 whole eggs per day. The yolk is where most of the vitamins and minerals are. </text><picname>Proteins</picname><picurl>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/images/ency/fullsize/19823.jpg</picurl></h3><h3 title="Dairy (milk and milk products) "><text>Always choose fat-free (skim) or low-fat (1%) dairy products, and try to consume 3 cups (0.72 liter) total per day. Be careful with flavored milks that may contain added sugars.Yogurt is best when it is fat-free or low-fat. Plain yogurt that you stir your own fresh or dried fruit into is better than fruit-flavored yogurts, which can contain added sugars.</text><text>Cream cheese, cream, and butter are not healthy dairy products and should be consumed in moderation.</text></h3><h3 title="Grains, cereals, and fiber"><text>Grain products are made from wheat, rice, oats, cornmeal, barley, or other grains such as millet, bulgur, and amaranth. Foods made with grains include: </text><detail>Pasta</detail><detail>Oatmeal</detail><detail>Breads</detail><detail>Breakfast cereals</detail><detail>Tortillas</detail><detail>Grits </detail><text>There are 2 kinds of grains: whole grains and refined grains. Choose mostly whole-grain foods. They are healthier for you because they have the entire grain kernel and have more protein and fiber than refined grains. These include: </text><detail>Bread and pasta made with whole-wheat flour</detail><detail>Bulgur (cracked wheat), amaranth, and other grains</detail><detail>Oatmeal</detail><detail>Popcorn</detail><detail>Brown rice </detail><text>Check the ingredients list, and buy breads and pastas that list "whole wheat" or "whole grain" as the first ingredient.</text><text>Refined grains are changed to make them last longer. They also have a finer texture. This process removes fiber, protein, iron, and many B vitamins. Refined grains include white flour, white rice, or de-germed cornmeal. Eat fewer foods that often have refined grains, such as white flour and pasta.</text><text>Products with added bran, such as oat bran or bran cereal, are a good source of fiber. Just remember, they may not be whole-grain products.</text></h3><h3 title="Oils and fats"><text>Monounsaturated or polyunsaturated fat. These are the healthiest type of fat. Many healthy oils come from plants, nuts, olives, or fish. They are liquid at room temperature.</text><text>Healthy choices include:</text><detail>Canola</detail><detail>Corn</detail><detail>Cottonseed</detail><detail>Olive</detail><detail>Safflower</detail><detail>Soybean</detail><detail>Sunflower oils </detail><text>Saturated fats. These are fats found mostly in animal products such as butter and lard. They are also found in coconut oil. Saturated fats are solid at room temperature. It is best to try and reduce the amount of saturated fat in your diet.</text><text>You can limit your intake of these fats by eating only a small amount of:</text><detail>Whole milk products</detail><detail>Cream</detail><detail>Ice cream</detail><detail>Butter</detail><detail>Snack foods such as cookies, cakes, and crackers that contain these ingredients </detail><text>Trans fats and hydrogenated fats. This type of fat is often found in fried foods. They are also in some donuts, cookies, and crackers. Many processed foods and margarines have them. The recommendation is to limit your intake of trans fats as much as possible.</text><text>Things you can do to help limit your intake of unhealthy saturated fats and trans fats include:</text><detail>Avoid fried foods. Fried food absorbs the fats from cooking oils. This increases your fat intake. If you do fry, cook with polyunsaturated oils. Try to saute foods in a small amount of oil instead of deep-fat frying.</detail><detail>Boil, grill, poach, and bake fish, chicken, and lean meats.</detail><detail>Read food labels. Try to avoid foods that have partially-hydrogenated fats or trans fats.

Fill half your plate with fruits and vegetables. Fill the other half with whole grains and meat.</text><text>Replace half of the cheese in your omelets with spinach, onions, tomatoes, or mushrooms. Replace 2 ounces (56 grams) of cheese and 2 ounces (56 grams) of meat in your sandwiches with lettuce, tomato, cucumbers, or onions.</text><text>You can reduce your portion of rice or pasta by stirring in broccoli, chopped bell pepper, cooked squash or other vegetables.

<item><title>Managing your weight gain during pregnancy</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000603.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>Most women should gain somewhere between 25 and 35 pounds (11.5 to 16 kilograms) during pregnancy. Most will gain 2 to 4 pounds (1 to 2 kilograms) during the first trimester, and then 1 pound (.5 kilogram) a week for the rest of the pregnancy. The amount of weight gain depends on your situation.</text><detail>Overweight women need to gain less (15 to 20 pounds or 7 to 9 kilograms or less, depending on their pre-pregnancy weight).</detail><detail>Underweight women will need to gain more (28 to 40 pounds or 13 to 18 kilograms).</detail><detail>You should gain more weight if you are having more than 1 baby. Women having twins need to gain 37 to 54 pounds (16.5 to 24.5 kilograms).</detail><text>A balanced, nutrient-rich diet, along with exercise, is the basis for a healthy pregnancy. For most pregnant women, the right amount of calories is:</text><detail>1,800 calories per day in the 1st trimester</detail><detail>2,200 calories per day in the 2nd trimester</detail><detail>2,400 calories per day in the 3rd trimester </detail></h2><h2 title="What's Causing the Weight Gain?"><text>Much of the weight that you gain during pregnancy is not fat, but is related to the baby. Here is a breakdown of how 35 pounds (16 kilograms) adds up:</text><detail>Baby: 8 pounds (3.5 kilograms)</detail><detail>Placenta: 2 to 3 pounds (1 to 1.5 kilograms)</detail><detail>Amniotic fluid: 2 to 3 pounds (1 to 1.5 kilograms)</detail><detail>Breast tissue: 2 to 3 pounds (1 to 1.5 kilograms)</detail><detail>Blood supply: 4 pounds (2 kilograms)</detail><detail>Fat stores: 5 to 9 pounds (2.5 to 4 kilograms)</detail><detail>Uterus growth: 2 to 5 pounds (1 to 2.5 kilograms) </detail></h2><h2 title="Managing Weight During Pregnancy"><text>Some women are already overweight when they get pregnant. Other women gain weight too quickly during their pregnancy. Either way, a pregnant woman should not go on a diet or try to lose weight during pregnancy.</text><text>It is better to focus on eating the right foods and staying active. If you do not gain enough weight during pregnancy, you and your baby may have problems.</text><text>Still, you can make changes in your diet to get the nutrients you need without gaining too much weight. Talk to your health care provider to get help with planning a healthy diet.</text><text>Below are some healthy eating tips to help you get started.</text><text>Healthy choices:</text><detail>Fresh fruits and vegetables make good snacks. They are full of vitamins and low in calories and fat.</detail><detail>Eat breads, crackers, and cereals made with whole grains.</detail><detail>Choose reduced-fat dairy products. You need at least 4 servings of milk products every day. However, using skim, 1%, or 2% milk will greatly reduce the amount of calories and fat you eat. Also choose low-fat or fat-free cheese or yogurt. </detail><text>Foods to avoid:</text><detail>Naturally sweetened is better than foods and drinks with added sugar or artificial sweeteners.</detail><detail>Food and drinks that list sugar or corn syrup as one of the first ingredients are not good choices.</detail><detail>Many sweetened drinks are high in calories. Read the label and watch out for drinks that are high in sugar. Substitute water for sodas and fruit drinks.</detail><detail>Avoid junk-food snacks, such as chips, candy, cake, cookies, and ice cream. The best way to keep from eating junk food or other unhealthy snacks is to not have these foods in your house.</detail><detail>Go light on fats. Fats include cooking oils, margarine, butter, gravy, sauces, mayonnaise, regular salad dressings, lard, sour cream, and cream cheese. Try the lower-fat versions of these foods. </detail><text>Eating out:</text><detail>Knowing the amount of calories, fat, and salt in your food can help you eat healthier.</detail><detail>Most restaurants have menus and nutrition facts on their websites. Use these to plan ahead.</detail><detail>In general, eat at places that offer salads, soups, and vegetables.</detail><detail>Avoid fast food. </detail><text>Cooking at home:</text><detail>Prepare meals using low-fat cooking methods.</detail><detail>Frying foods in oil or butter will increase the calories and fat of the meal.</detail><detail>Baking, broiling, grilling, or boiling are healthier, lower-fat methods of cooking. </detail><text>Exercise:</text><detail>Moderate exercise, as recommended by your provider, can help burn extra calories.</detail><detail>Walking or swimming are generally safe, effective exercises for pregnant women.</detail><detail>Be sure to talk to your provider before starting an exercise program. </detail></h2><h2 title="Body Image During Pregnancy"><text>If you have struggled with your weight in the past, it may be hard to accept that it is ok to gain weight now. It is normal to feel anxious as the numbers on the scale edge up. </text><text>Keep in mind that you need to gain weight for a healthy pregnancy. The extra pounds will come off after you have had your baby. However, if you gain a lot more weight than is recommended, your baby will also be bigger. That can sometimes lead to problems with delivery. A healthy diet and regular exercise are your best ways to ensure a healthy pregnancy and baby. </text></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>Prenatal care - managing your weight</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 11/11/2016"><text>Updated by: Irina Burd, MD, PhD, Associate Professor of Gynecology and Obstetrics at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD.

<item><title>Managing your chronic back pain</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000516.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>Managing chronic pain means finding ways to make your back pain tolerable so you can live your life. You may not be able to get rid of your pain completely, but you can change some things that worsen your pain. These things are called stressors. Some of them may be physical, like the chair you sit in at work. Some may be emotional, like a difficult relationship.</text><text>Reducing stress can improve your physical and emotional health. It is not always easy to reduce stress, but it's easier if you are able to ask your friends and family for help.</text></h2><h2 title="Make a List"><text>First, make a list of what makes your back pain better and what makes it worse.</text><text>Then try to make changes in your home and work to decrease the causes of your pain. For example, if bending to pick up heavy pots sends shooting pain down your back, rearrange your kitchen so that the pots are hanging from above or are stored at waist height.</text><text>If your back pain is worse at work, talk to your boss. It may be that your workstation isn't set up correctly.</text><detail>If you sit at a computer, make sure that your chair has a straight back with an adjustable seat and back, armrests, and a swivel seat.</detail><detail>Ask about having an occupational therapist assess your workspace or movements to see if changes such as a new chair or cushioned mat under your feet would help.</detail><detail>Try not to stand for long periods. If you must stand at work, rest one foot on a stool, then the other foot. Keep switching the load of your body's weight between your feet during the day. </detail><text>Long car rides and getting in and out of the car can be hard on your back. Here are some tips:</text><detail>Adjust your car seat to make it easier to enter, sit in, and get out of your car.</detail><detail>Bring your seat as far forward as possible to avoid leaning forward when you are driving.</detail><detail>If you drive long distances, stop and walk around every hour.</detail><detail>DO NOT lift heavy objects right after a long car ride. </detail><text>These changes around your home could help relieve your back pain:</text><detail>Raise your foot up to the edge of a chair or stool to put your socks and shoes on instead of bending over. Also consider wearing shorter socks. They are quicker and easier to put on.</detail><detail>Use a raised toilet seat or install handrail next to the toilet to help take pressure off your back when you sit on and get up from the toilet. Also make sure the toilet paper is easy to reach.</detail><detail>DO NOT wear high-heeled shoes. If you must wear them sometimes, consider wearing comfortable shoes with flat soles to and from the event or until you must put on high-heels.</detail><detail>Wear shoes with cushioned soles.</detail><detail>Rest your feet on a low stool while you're sitting so that your knees are higher than your hips. </detail></h2><h2 title="Rely on Friends and Family"><text>It is important to have strong relationships with family and friends you can depend on when your back pain makes it hard to get through the day.</text><text>Take time to build strong friendships at work and outside of work by using caring words and being kind. Give sincere compliments to the people around you. Respect those around you and treat them the way you like to be treated.</text><text>If a relationship is causing stress, consider working with a counselor to find ways to resolve conflict and strengthen the relationship</text></h2><h2 title="Establish Life Routines "><text>Set up good life habits and routines such as:</text><detail>Exercise a little every day. Walking is a good way to keep your heart healthy and your muscles strong. If walking is too hard for you, work with a physical therapist to develop an exercise plan that you can do and maintain.</detail><detail>Eat foods that are low in fats and sugar. Healthy foods make your body feel better, and they decrease your risk of being overweight, which can cause back pain.</detail><detail>Reduce demands on your time. Learn how to say yes to things that are important and no to those that are not.</detail><detail>Prevent pain from starting. Figure out what causes your back pain, and find other ways to get the job done.</detail><detail>Take medicines as needed.</detail><detail>Make time for activities that make you feel relaxed and calm.</detail><detail>Give yourself extra time to get things done or to get where you need to go.</detail><detail>Do things that make you laugh.

Talk to your doctor and diabetes educator about how often you should check your blood sugar.</text><detail>Not everyone with diabetes needs to check their blood sugar every day. But some people may need to check it many times a day.</detail><detail>If you have type 1 diabetes, check your blood sugar at least 4 times a day. </detail><text>Usually, you will test your blood sugar before meals and at bedtime.

If your blood sugar is higher than your goals for 3 days and you don't know why, call your provider.</text><text>Random blood sugar values are often not that useful to your provider and this can be frustrating to people with diabetes. Often fewer values with more information (meal description and time, exercise description and time, medication dose and time) related to the blood sugar value are much more useful to help guide medication decisions and dose adjustments.</text></h2><h2 title="Recommended Blood Sugar Targets"><text>For people with type 1 diabetes, the American Diabetes Association recommends that blood sugar targets be based on a person's needs and goals.

<item><title>Managing tension headaches at home</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000421.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>A tension headache is pain or discomfort in your head, scalp, or neck. Tension headache is a common type of headache. It can occur at any age, but it is most common in teens and adults.</text><text>A tension headache occurs when neck and scalp muscles become tense, or contract. The muscle contractions can be a response to stress, depression, a head injury, or anxiety.</text></h2><h2 title="When You Have a Tension Headache"><text>Hot or cold showers or baths may relieve a headache for some people. You may also want to rest in a quiet room with a cool cloth on your forehead.</text><text>Gently massaging your head and neck muscles may provide relief.</text><text>If your headaches are due to stress or anxiety, you may want to learn ways to relax.</text><text>Over-the-counter pain medicine, such as aspirin, ibuprofen, or acetaminophen, may relieve pain. If you are planning to take part in an activity that you know will trigger a headache, taking pain medicine beforehand may help.</text><text>Follow your health care provider's instructions about how to take your medicines. Rebound headaches are headaches that keep coming back. They can occur from overuse of pain medicine. If you take pain medicine more than 3 days a week on a regular basis, you can develop rebound headaches. </text><text>Be aware that aspirin and ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) can irritate your stomach. If you take acetaminophen (Tylenol), DO NOT take more than a total of 4,000 mg (4 grams) of regular strength or 3,000 mg (3 grams) of extra strength a day to avoid liver damage.</text></h2><h2 title="Preventing Tension Headaches"><text>Knowing your headache triggers can help you avoid situations that cause your headaches. A headache diary can help.

This can help you and your provider create a treatment plan. Knowing your triggers can help you avoid them.</text><text>Lifestyle changes that may help include:</text><detail>Use a different pillow or change sleeping positions.</detail><detail>Practice good posture when reading, working, or doing other activities.</detail><detail>Exercise and stretch your back, neck, and shoulders often when typing, working on computers, or doing other close-up work.</detail><detail>Get more vigorous exercise. This is exercise that gets your heart beating fast. (Check with your provider about what kind of exercise is best for you.)</detail><detail>Have your eyes checked. If you have glasses, use them.</detail><detail>Learn and practice stress management. Some people find relaxation exercises or meditation helpful.</detail><text>If your provider prescribes medicines to prevent headaches or help with stress, follow instructions exactly on how to take them.

<item><title>Managing pain during labor</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000587.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>There is no one best method for dealing with pain during labor. The best choice is the one that makes the most sense for you. Whether you choose to use pain relief or not, it is good to prepare yourself for natural childbirth. </text></h2><h2 title="Natural Childbirth"><text>The pain felt during childbirth is different for every woman. Some women choose natural childbirth, or giving birth without medicine for pain. If all goes well, it can be a great experience.</text><text>If you want to deliver without medicine, take a childbirth class. Childbirth classes teach breathing and relaxation techniques. These techniques can help you relieve pain naturally during birth. And, they can add to the relief you get from medicine if you choose to take it.</text><text>For some women, the techniques learned in childbirth classes are enough to relieve their pain. Other women may choose to use pain medicine during childbirth. </text></h2><h2 title="Pain Medicines for Childbirth"><text>A systemic analgesic is a pain medicine that is injected into your vein or muscle. This medicine acts on your entire nervous system rather than just a certain part of your body. The pain may not completely go away, but it will be dulled.</text><text>With systemic analgesics, some women have an easier labor and feel more relaxed. These medicines often do not slow down labor. They also do not affect contractions.</text><text>But, they make you and your baby drowsy. Some women complain of feeling like they lose control.</text><text>An epidural block numbs or causes a loss of feeling in the lower half of your body. Your health care provider injects the block into your lower back. This lessens the pain of contractions and makes it easier to deliver your baby through your vagina.</text><text>Epidural is the safest and most effective pain-relieving procedure. Most women choose an epidural to manage the pain of their labor. Facts about epidurals:</text><detail>There is no sedating effect on you or your baby.</detail><detail>The risks are small.</detail><detail>The chances of needing a cesarean delivery (C-section) do not increase.</detail><detail>Labor sometimes is slightly longer if you receive an epidural.</detail><detail>Many times an epidural can allow labor that has stalled to progress.</detail><detail>The biggest side effect of an epidural is numbness and lack of movement (mobility).</detail><text>Local anesthesia (pudendal block) is a numbing medicine that your provider injects into your vagina and rectal areas when you are close to delivery. It lessens the pain as the baby passes through the numbed area.</text></h2><h2 title="Plan and Be Prepared"><text>Keep in mind that a plan is just a plan. Be flexible when you are planning for your labor and delivery. Things often change when the actual day arrives. Many women decide before going into labor to have natural childbirth. Later, they change their mind and decide they want pain medicine after all. It is OK to change your mind.</text><text>Other women plan on pain medicine, but they arrive at the hospital too late. Sometimes, the baby is born before the woman can get pain medicine.

<item><title>Managing migraines at home</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000420.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>A migraine is a common type of headache. It may occur with symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, or sensitivity to light. Most people feel a throbbing pain on only one side of their head during a migraine.</text><text>Some people who get migraines have warning signs, called an aura, before the actual headache begins. An aura is a group of symptoms that includes vision changes. An aura is a warning sign that a bad headache is coming.</text><text>Migraine headaches can be triggered by certain foods. The most common are:</text><detail>Any processed, fermented, pickled, or marinated foods, as well as foods that contain monosodium glutamate (MSG)</detail><detail>Baked goods, chocolate, nuts, and dairy products</detail><detail>Fruits (such as avocado, banana, and citrus fruit)</detail><detail>Meats containing sodium nitrates, such as bacon, hot dogs, salami, and cured meats</detail><detail>Red wine, aged cheese, smoked fish, chicken liver, figs, and certain beans </detail><text>Alcohol, stress, hormonal changes, skipping meals, lack of sleep, certain odors or perfumes, loud noises or bright lights, exercise, and cigarette smoking may also trigger a migraine.</text></h2><h2 title="When You Get a Migraine"><text>Try to treat your symptoms right away. This may help make the headache less severe. When migraine symptoms begin:</text><detail>Drink water to avoid dehydration, especially if you have vomited</detail><detail>Rest in a quiet, darkened room</detail><detail>Place a cool cloth on your head </detail><text>Over-the-counter pain medicines, such as acetaminophen, ibuprofen, or aspirin, are often helpful when your migraine is mild.</text><text>Your health care provider may have prescribed medicines to stop a migraine. These drugs come in different forms. They may come as a nasal spray, rectal suppository, or injection instead of pills. Other medicines can treat nausea and vomiting.</text><text>Follow your provider's instructions about how to take all of your medicines. Rebound headaches are headaches that keep coming back. They can occur from overuse of pain medicine. If you take pain medicine more than 3 days a week on a regular basis, you can develop rebound headaches.</text></h2><h2 title="Preventing Migraine Headaches"><text>A headache diary can help you identify your headache triggers. When you get a headache, write down:</text><detail>Day and time the pain began</detail><detail>What you ate and drank over the past 24 hours</detail><detail>How much you slept</detail><detail>What you were doing and where you were right before the pain started</detail><detail>How long the headache lasted and what made it stop </detail><text>Review your diary with your provider to identify triggers or a pattern to your headaches. This can help you and your provider create a treatment plan. Knowing your triggers can help you avoid them. </text><text>Lifestyle changes that may help include:</text><detail>Avoid triggers that seem to bring on a migraine headache.</detail><detail>Get regular sleep and exercise.</detail><detail>Slowly decrease the amount of caffeine you drink every day.</detail><detail>Learn and practice stress management. Some people find relaxation exercises and meditation helpful. </detail><text>If you have frequent migraines, your provider may prescribe medicine to reduce the number of them. You need to take this medicine every day for it to be effective. Your provider may have you try more than one drug before deciding which works best for you.</text></h2><h2 title="When to Call the Doctor"><text>Call 911 if:</text><detail>You are experiencing "the worst headache of your life."</detail><detail>You have speech, vision, or movement problems or loss of balance, especially if you have not had these symptoms with a headache before.</detail><detail>A headache starts suddenly. </detail><text>Schedule an appointment or call your provider if:</text><detail>Your headache patterns or pain changes.</detail><detail>Treatments that once worked are no longer help.</detail><detail>You have side effects from your medicine.</detail><detail>You are pregnant or could become pregnant. Some medicines should not be taken during pregnancy.</detail><detail>You need to take pain medicines more than 3 days a week.</detail><detail>You are taking birth control pills and have migraine headaches.</detail><detail>Your headaches are more severe when lying down. </detail></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>Headache - migraine - self-care; Vascular headache - self-care</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 11/22/2017"><text>Updated by: Luc Jasmin, MD, PhD, FRCS (C), FACS, Department of Surgery at Providence Medical Center, Medford OR; Department of Surgery at Ashland Community Hospital, Ashland OR; Department of Maxillofacial Surgery at UCSF, San Francisco CA.

<item><title>Managing menopause at home</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000392.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>Menopause is most often a natural event that normally occurs between the ages of 45 and 55. After menopause, a woman can no longer become pregnant.</text></h2><h2 title="What to Expect at Home"><text>For most women, menstrual periods will slowly stop over time.</text><detail>During this time, your periods may become either more closely or more widely spaced. This pattern may last for 1 to 3 years.</detail><detail>Menopause is complete when you have not had a period for 1 year. This is called post menopause. </detail><text>Your menstrual flow may come to a sudden halt after surgeries to remove your ovaries, chemotherapy, or certain hormone treatments for breast cancer.</text><text>Symptoms of menopause vary widely. Some women have no symptom, while others have symptoms that are moderate to severe. Also, some women may have symptoms for 1 to 2 years, and others may have ongoing symptoms.</text><text>Common symptoms include:</text><detail>Hot flashes</detail><detail>Mood disturbances</detail><detail>Sexual problems </detail></h2><h2 title="Taking Hormones"><text>Talk to your provider if your menopause symptoms are very bad. You and your provider can weigh the risk and benefits of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) to see if this option would be right for you. </text><text>If your health care provider has prescribed HRT for menopause symptoms, take these medicines as directed. Ask your provider what you should do if you miss a dose.</text><text>When taking hormones:</text><detail>Follow up carefully with your provider.</detail><detail>Ask about when you need mammograms or a test to check your bones.</detail><detail>DO NOT smoke. Smoking will increase the chance of blood clots in your legs or your lungs.</detail><detail>Report any new vaginal bleeding right away. Also report menstrual bleeding that comes more often or is more severe. </detail></h2><h2 title="Managing hot Flashes"><text>The following non-hormonal treatments can help you manage hot flashes:</text><detail>Dress lightly and in layers. Try to keep your environment cool.</detail><detail>Practice slow, deep breathing whenever a hot flash starts to come on. Try taking six breaths per minute.</detail><detail>Try relaxation techniques such as yoga, tai chi, or meditation.</detail><text>Watching what you eat or drink can improve your symptoms and help you sleep:</text><detail>Eat at regular times each day. Eat a healthy diet that is low in fat and includes lots of fruits and vegetables.</detail><detail>Milk and other dairy products contain tryptophan, which may help induce sleep.</detail><detail>If you can, avoid coffee, colas with caffeine, and energy drinks completely. If you cannot avoid them, try not to have any after the early part of the afternoon.</detail><detail>Alcohol may make your symptoms worse and often leads to a more disrupted sleep. </detail><text>Nicotine stimulates the body and will make it harder to fall asleep. This includes both cigarettes and smokeless tobacco. So if you smoke, consider quitting.</text><text>A class of antidepressant medicines called SSRIs has also been shown to help with hot flashes.</text></h2><h2 title="Intimacy"><text>Vaginal dryness may be relieved by using a water-soluble vaginal lubricant during intercourse. DO NOT use petroleum jelly or topical estrogen cream or tablets.</text><detail>Over the counter vaginal moisturizers are also available and can help to improve vaginal dryness.</detail><detail>Ask your provider about vaginal estrogen creams. </detail><text>Once you have not had a period for 1 year, you are no longer at risk of becoming pregnant. Before that, use birth control to prevent pregnancy. DO NOT use mineral oils or other oils if you use condoms, as these may damage latex condoms or diaphragms.</text><text>Kegel exercises can help with vaginal muscle tone and help you control urine leakage.</text><text>Continuing to have sexual intimacy is important to keep the normal sexual response.</text></h2><h2 title="What Else"><text>Reach out to other people. Find someone you trust (such as a friend, family member, or neighbor) who will listen to you and offer support. Often, just talking to someone helps relieve some of the anxiety and stress of menopause.</text><text>Get plenty of exercise. It can help you feel healthier and will keep your bones strong.</text><text>You need enough calcium and vitamin D to prevent bone thinning (osteoporosis):</text><detail>You need about 1,200 mg of calcium per day from food sources or supplements. Eat high calcium foods, such as cheese, leafy green vegetables, low-fat milk and other dairy, salmon, sardines, and tofu, or take a calcium supplement. You can make a list of calcium contained in your food to find out how much calcium you usually get from your diet. If you fall below 1,200 mg, add a supplement to make up the rest.</detail><detail>You need 800 to 1,000 IU of vitamin D a day. Diet and sunlight provide some. But most menopausal women need to take vitamin D supplements.</detail><detail>Calcium and vitamin D supplements can be taken as separate supplements or combined as one.</detail><detail>If you have a history of kidney stones, talk with your provider first. </detail><text>After menopause, a woman's risk for heart disease and stroke goes up. Ask your provider about what you should do to control your blood pressure, cholesterol, and other risk factors for heart disease.</text></h2><h2 title="When to Call the Doctor"><text>Call your health care provider if you find you are unable to manage your symptoms of menopause with home care only.</text><text>Also call if you have any unusual menstrual bleeding, or if you have any spotting or bleeding at all 1 year or more after your last period.</text></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>Perimenopause - self-care; Hormone replacement therapy - self-care; HRT- self-care</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 7/17/2017"><text>Updated by: Cynthia D.

Your health care provider can use allergy skin testing to see if you have a latex allergy.</text><text>A blood test can also be done to help your provider tell whether you are allergic to latex.</text></h2><h2 title="How to Avoid Latex"><text>Always tell any provider, dentist, or person who draws blood from you that you have a latex allergy. More and more, people wear gloves in the workplace and elsewhere to protect their hands and avoid germs. These tips can help you avoid latex:</text><detail>If people use latex products in your workplace, tell your employer you are allergic to it. Stay away from areas at work where latex is used.</detail><detail>Wear a medical alert bracelet so that others know you are allergic to latex, in case you have a medical emergency.</detail><detail>Before eating at a restaurant, ask if food handlers wear latex gloves when handling or preparing food. While rare, some very sensitive people have gotten sick from food prepared by handlers wearing latex gloves. Proteins from the latex gloves can transfer to food and kitchen surfaces. </detail><text>Carry a pair of vinyl or other non-latex gloves with you and have more at home. Wear them when you handle items that:</text><detail>Someone who wore latex gloves touched</detail><detail>May have latex in them but you are not sure </detail><text>For children who are allergic to latex:</text><detail>Make sure daycare providers, babysitters, teachers, and your children's friends and their families know that your children have latex allergies.</detail><detail>Tell your children's dentists and other providers such as doctors and nurses.</detail><detail>Teach your child not to touch toys and other products that contain latex.</detail><detail>Choose toys that are made of wood, metal, or cloth that does not contain elastic. If you are not sure if a toy has latex, check the packaging or call the toy maker. </detail></h2><h2 title="When to Call the Doctor"><text>Your provider may prescribe epinephrine if you are at risk of a severe allergic reaction to latex.

<item><title>Mallet finger - aftercare</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000538.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>Mallet finger occurs when you cannot straighten your finger. When you do try to straighten it, the tip of your finger remains bent toward your palm. </text><text>Sports injuries are the most common cause of mallet finger, particularly from catching a ball. </text></h2><h2 title="More About Your Injury"><text>Tendons attach muscles to bones. The tendon that attaches to the tip of your finger bone on the back side helps you straighten your fingertip. </text><text>Mallet finger occurs when this tendon: </text><detail>Is stretched or torn</detail><detail>Pulls a piece of bone away from the rest of the bone (avulsion fracture) </detail><text>Mallet finger most often occurs when something hits the tip of your straightened finger and bends it down with force. </text></h2><h2 title="What to Expect"><text>Wearing a splint on your finger to keep it straight is the most common treatment for mallet finger. You may need to wear a splint for different lengths of time. </text><detail>If your tendon is only stretched, not torn, it should heal in 4 to 6 weeks if you wear a splint all the time.</detail><detail>If your tendon is torn or pulled off the bone, it should heal in 6 to 8 weeks of wearing a splint all the time. After that, you will need to wear your splint for another 3 to 4 weeks, at night only. </detail><text>If you wait to start treatment or DO NOT wear the splint as you are told, you may have to wear it longer. Surgery is rarely needed except for more severe fractures.</text><text>Your splint is made of hard plastic or aluminum. A trained professional should make your splint to make sure it fits correctly and your finger is in the right position for healing. </text><detail>Your splint should be snug enough to hold your finger in a straight position so that it does not droop. But it should not be so tight that it cuts off blood flow.</detail><detail>If your skin is white when you take off your splint, it may be too tight. </detail></h2><h2 title="Activity"><text>You will likely be able to return to your normal activities or sports, as long as you wear your splint all the time. </text></h2><h2 title="Self-care at Home"><text>Be careful when you take off your splint to clean it. </text><detail>Keep your finger straight the whole time the splint is off.</detail><detail>Letting your fingertip droop or bend may mean you will have to wear your splint even longer. </detail><text>When you shower, cover your finger and splint with a plastic bag. If they get wet, dry them after your shower. Keep your finger straight at all times. </text><text>Using an ice pack can help with pain. Apply the ice pack for 20 minutes, every hour you are awake for the first 2 days, then for 10 to 20 minutes, 3 times daily as needed to reduce pain and swelling. </text><text>For pain, you can use ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn), or acetaminophen (Tylenol). You can buy these pain medicines at the store.</text><detail>Talk with your health care provider before using these medicines if you have heart disease, high blood pressure, kidney disease, or have had stomach ulcers or internal bleeding in the past.</detail><detail>DO NOT take more than the amount recommended on the bottle or by your provider. </detail></h2><h2 title="Follow-up"><text>When it is time for your splint to come off, your provider will examine how well your finger has healed. Swelling in your finger when you are no longer wearing the splint may be a sign that the tendon has not healed yet. You may need another x-ray of your finger.</text><text>If your finger has not healed at the end of treatment, your provider may recommend another 4 weeks of wearing the splint.</text></h2><h2 title="When to Call the Doctor"><text>Call your provider if: </text><detail>Your finger is still swollen at the end of your treatment time</detail><detail>Your pain gets worse at any time</detail><detail>The skin of your finger changes color</detail><detail>You develop numbness or tingling in your finger </detail></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>Baseball finger - aftercare; Drop finger - aftercare; Avulsion fracture - mallet finger - aftercare</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 4/9/2018"><text>Updated by: C.

<item><title>Make time to move</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000765.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>Experts recommend getting at least 30 minutes of moderate exercise most days of the week. If you have a busy schedule, this may seem like a lot.

Instead, look for simple ways to make exercise a regular part of your life.</text><detail>Break it up. You do not need to do all 30 minutes of exercise at one time. You can get the same health benefits from doing three 10-minute sessions, or two 15-minute workouts. For example, you could do 10 minutes of squats and push-ups in the morning, take a brisk 10-minute walk after lunch, then play a round of hoops with the kids after dinner.</detail><detail>Find something you enjoy. DO NOT struggle to do an exercise you do not like. There are endless ways to get moving. Keep trying until you find different activities you like. Then keep mixing it up.</detail><detail>Make your commute count. If possible, bike, walk, or jog to and from work. You may find you feel less stressed and have more energy when you arrive. Plus, you will save money by not having to pay for parking, gas, or bus fare.</detail><detail>Get up earlier. A morning workout can boost your energy for the rest of the day. So set your alarm in the morning for 30 minutes earlier. Walk or jog around the neighborhood, or use a stationary bike or treadmill indoors.</detail><detail>Choose the right time for you. While a.m. exercise may be a great way to start the day, if you are not a morning person, it may feel like a chore. Instead, try exercising at lunchtime or after work.</detail><detail>Schedule your exercise. Make getting exercise just as important as your other appointments. Set aside time in your daily planner. No one needs to know what you are doing. They just need to know that you are not available during that time. Also, no matter what type of exercise you do, try to do it at the same time every day. This helps make it part of your routine. For example, you might swim after work every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. Or, you could take a walk after dinner every weeknight.</detail><detail>Join a team. Softball, basketball, hockey, and soccer are not just for kids. Look for recreational teams in your community. Most leagues are open to all skill levels. So do not worry if you have not played before. Joining a team can make exercise more fun and help keep you motivated.</detail><detail>Tune in while you work out. Use TV time to exercise. You can stretch, jog in place, jump rope, use resistance bands, or use a bike trainer while you watch your favorite TV shows.</detail><detail>Join or start a fitness group at work. Your co-workers likely face the same struggles to exercise as you do. Get together with like-minded folks at work to walk or jog at lunch or after work.</detail><detail>Make coffee dates active. If you regularly meet a friend for coffee or lunch, think about making it an activity date instead. Take a walk or a hike, go bowling, or try a new exercise class together. Many people find exercising with a friend more fun.</detail><detail>Get a trainer. Working with a trainer can help teach you new ways to exercise and keep you motivated. Just make sure to ask about the trainer's qualifications. They should have an exercise certification from a national organization, such as the American College of Sports Medicine. Many gyms offer group training, which can help cut the cost.</detail><detail>Get fit with your family. Plan weekly outings with your children that include exercise. Go bicycling, take a nature walk, or go swimming. Or, sign up for an exercise class for parents and children. </detail></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>Exercise - time to move; Weight loss - time to move; Obesity - time to move</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 4/15/2018"><text>Updated by: Linda J.

Most times, they build slowly. Checking your peak flow can tell you if an attack is coming, sometimes before you have any symptoms.</text></h2><h2 title="What is Peak Flow?"><text>Peak flow can tell you how well you blow air out of your lungs. If your airways are narrowed and blocked due to asthma, your peak flow values drop.</text><text>You can check your peak flow at home with a small, plastic meter. Some meters have tabs on the side that you can adjust to match your action plan zones (green, yellow, red). If your meter does not have these, you can mark them with colored tape or a marker.</text></h2><h2 title="Write Down Your Peak Flow Numbers"><text>Write down your peak flow scores (numbers) on a chart or diary. Many brands of peak flow meters come with charts. Make a copy of your chart to bring with you when you see your health care provider.</text><text>Next to your peak flow number also write:</text><detail>Any signs or symptoms you felt.</detail><detail>Steps you took if you had symptoms or your peak flow dropped.</detail><detail>Changes in your asthma drugs.</detail><detail>Any asthma triggers you were exposed to. </detail></h2><h2 title="Use Your Peak Flow Meter Every Day"><text>Once you know your personal best, take your peak flow at:</text><detail>Every morning when you wake up, before you take medicine. Make this part of your daily morning routine.</detail><detail>When you have asthma symptoms or an attack.</detail><detail>Again after you take medicine for the attack. This can tell you how bad your asthma attack is and if your medicine is working.</detail><detail>Any other time your provider tells you to. </detail><text>Check to see which zone your peak flow number is in. Do what your provider told you to do when you are in that zone. This information should be in your action plan.</text><text>Do your peak flow 3 times and record the best value every time you check it.</text><text>If you use more than one peak flow meter (such as one at home and another one at school or work), be sure that all of them are the same brand.</text></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>Asthma - make peak flow a habit; Reactive airway disease - peak flow; Bronchial asthma - peak flow</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 2/18/2018"><text>Updated by: Laura J.

<item><title>Niacin for cholesterol</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000788.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>Niacin is a B-vitamin. When taken as a prescription in larger doses, it can help lower cholesterol and other fats in your blood. Niacin helps:</text><detail>Raise HDL (good) cholesterol</detail><detail>Lower LDL (bad) cholesterol</detail><detail>Lower triglycerides, another type of fat in your blood </detail><text>Niacin works by blocking how your liver makes cholesterol. Cholesterol can stick to the walls of your arteries and narrow or block them.</text></h2><h2 title="How Niacin Helps"><text>Improving your cholesterol levels can help protect you from: </text><detail>Heart disease</detail><detail>Heart attack</detail><detail>Stroke </detail><text>Your health care provider will work with you to lower your cholesterol by improving your diet. If this is not successful, medicines to lower cholesterol may be the next step. Statins are thought to be the best drugs to use for people who need medicines to lower their cholesterol.</text><text>Research now suggests that niacin does not add to the benefit of a statin alone for reducing the risk of cardiovascular events, including heart attacks and stroke. </text><text>In addition, niacin can cause unpleasant and potentially dangerous side effects. Therefore, its use has been declining. However, some people may be prescribed niacin in addition to other drugs if they have very high cholesterol or if they do not tolerate other medicines.</text></h2><h2 title="Which Niacin Medicine is Right for you?"><text>There are different brands of niacin medicines. Most also come in a less expensive, generic form.</text><text>Niacin may be prescribed along with other medicines, such as a statin, to help lower cholesterol. Combination tablets that include nicotinic acid plus other medicines are also available.</text><text>Niacin is also sold over-the-counter (OTC) as a supplement. You should not take OTC niacin to help lower cholesterol. Doing so could have serious side effects.</text></h2><h2 title="How to Take Niacin"><text>Take your medicine as directed. The medicine comes in tablet form. DO NOT break or chew tablets before taking the medicine. DO NOT stop taking your medicine without talking with your provider first. </text><text>You take niacin 1 to 3 times per day. It comes in different doses, depending on how much you need. </text><text>Read the label on the pill bottle carefully. Some brands should be taken at bedtime with a light, low-fat snack; others you will take with dinner. Avoid alcohol and hot drinks while taking niacin to reduce flushing.</text><text>Store all of your medicines in a cool, dry place. Keep them where children cannot get to them.</text><text>You should follow a healthy diet while taking niacin. This includes eating less fat in your diet. Other ways you can help your heart include:</text><detail>Getting regular exercise</detail><detail>Managing stress</detail><detail>Quitting smoking </detail></h2><h2 title="Know Your Risks"><text>Before you start taking niacin, tell your provider if you:</text><detail>Are pregnant, plan to become pregnant, or are breastfeeding</detail><detail>Have allergies</detail><detail>Are taking other medicines</detail><detail>Drink a lot of alcohol</detail><detail>Have diabetes, kidney disease, peptic ulcer, or gout </detail><text>Talk to your provider about all of your medicines, herbs, or supplements. Certain medicines may interact with niacin.</text><text>Regular blood tests will help you and your provider:</text><detail>See how well the medicine is working</detail><detail>Monitor for side effects, such as liver problems </detail></h2><h2 title="Possible Side Effects"><text>Mild side effects may include:</text><detail>Flushing and red face or neck</detail><detail>Diarrhea</detail><detail>Headache</detail><detail>Upset stomach</detail><detail>Skin rash </detail><text>Though rare, more serious side effects are possible.

<item><title>Newborn jaundice - discharge</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000296.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>Your baby has been treated in the hospital for newborn jaundice. This article tells you what you need to know when your baby comes home.</text></h2><h2 title="When Your Child Was in the Hospital"><text>Your baby has newborn jaundice. This common condition is caused by high levels of bilirubin in the blood. Your child's skin and sclera (whites of his eyes) will look yellow.</text><text>Some newborns need to be treated before they leave the hospital. Others may need to go back to the hospital when they are a few days old. Treatment in the hospital most often lasts 1 to 2 days. Your child needs treatment when their bilirubin level is too high or rising too quickly.</text><text>To help break down the bilirubin, your child will be placed under bright lights (phototherapy) in a warm, enclosed bed. The infant will wear only a diaper and special eye shades. Your baby may have an intravenous (IV) line to give them fluids.</text><text>Rarely, your baby may need treatment called a double volume blood exchange transfusion. This is used when the baby's bilirubin level is very high.</text><text>Unless there are other problems, your child will be able to feed (by breast or bottle) normally. Your child should feed every 2 to 2 ½ hours (10 to 12 times a day).</text><text>The health care provider may stop phototherapy and send your child home when their bilirubin level is low enough to be safe. Your child's bilirubin level will need to be checked in the provider's office, 24 hours after therapy stops, to make sure the level is not rising again.</text><text>Possible side effects of phototherapy are watery diarrhea, dehydration, and skin rash that will go away once the therapy stops.</text></h2><h2 title="What to Expect at Home"><text>If your child did not have jaundice at birth but now has it, you should call your provider. Bilirubin levels are generally the highest when a newborn is 3 to 5 days old.</text><text>If the bilirubin level is not too high or not rising quickly, you can do phototherapy at home with a fiber optic blanket, which has tiny bright lights in it. You may also use a bed that shines light up from the mattress. A nurse will come to your home to teach you how to use the blanket or bed and to check on your child.</text><text>The nurse will return daily to check your child's:</text><detail>Weight</detail><detail>Intake of breast milk or formula</detail><detail>Number of wet and poopy (stool) diapers</detail><detail>Skin, to see how far down (head to toe) the yellow color goes</detail><detail>Bilirubin level </detail><text>You must keep the light therapy on your child's skin and feed your child every 2 to 3 hours (10 to 12 times a day). Feeding prevents dehydration and helps bilirubin leave the body.</text><text>Therapy will continue until your baby's bilirubin level lowers enough to be safe. Your baby's provider will want to check the level again in 2 to 3 days.</text><text>If you are having trouble breastfeeding, contact a breastfeeding nurse specialist.</text></h2><h2 title="When to Call the Doctor"><text>Call your baby's health care provider if the infant: </text><detail>Has a yellow color that goes away, but then returns after treatment stop.</detail><detail>Has a yellow color that lasts for more than 2 to 3 weeks</detail><text>Also call your baby's provider if you have concerns, if the jaundice is getting worse, or the baby:</text><detail>Is lethargic (hard to wake up), less responsive, or fussy</detail><detail>Refuses the bottle or breast for more than 2 feedings in a row</detail><detail>Is losing weight</detail><detail>Has watery diarrhea</detail></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>Jaundice of the newborn - discharge; Neonatal hyperbilirubinemia - discharge; Breastfeeding jaundice - discharge; Physiologic jaundice - discharge</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 2/16/2017"><text>Updated by: Neil K.

<item><title>Nasal fracture - aftercare</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000554.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>Your nose has 2 bones at the bridge of your nose and a long piece of cartilage (flexible but strong tissue) that gives your nose its shape. </text><text>A nasal fracture occurs when the bony part of your nose has been broken. Most broken noses are caused by trauma such as sport injuries, car accidents, or fistfights. </text></h2><h2 title="More About Your Injury"><text>If your nose is crooked from the injury you may need a reduction in order to put the bones back in place. If the break is easy to fix, a reduction can be done in the health care provider's office. If the break is more severe, you may need surgery to fix it.</text><text>You may have a hard time breathing through your nose because the bones may be out of place or there is a lot of swelling.</text></h2><h2 title="What to Expect"><text>You may have one or all of these symptoms of a broken nose:</text><detail>Swelling on the outside and on the bridge of your nose</detail><detail>Pain</detail><detail>A crooked shape to your nose</detail><detail>Bleeding from either inside or outside the nose</detail><detail>Difficulty breathing through your nose</detail><detail>Bruising around one or both eyes </detail><text>Your provider may need to get an x-ray of your nose to see if you have a fracture. A CT scan or other tests may be needed to rule out a more serious injury.</text><text>If you have a nosebleed that does not stop, the provider may insert a soft gauze pad or other kind of packing into the bleeding nostril.</text><text>You may have had a nasal septal hematoma. This is a collection of blood within the septum of the nose. The septum is the part of the nose between the 2 nostrils. An injury disrupts the blood vessels so that fluid and blood may collect under the lining. Your provider may have made a small cut or used a needle to drain the blood.</text><text>If you need surgery, you will need to wait until most or all of the swelling has gone down. In most cases, this is 3 to 6 days after your injury. You may be referred to a special doctor -- such as a plastic surgeon or an ear, nose, and throat doctor -- if the injury is more severe.</text></h2><h2 title="Symptom Relief"><text>For simple breaks, in which the nasal bone is not crooked, the provider may tell you to take pain medicine and nasal decongestants, and to put ice on the injury.</text><text>To keep pain and swelling down:</text><detail>Rest. Try to keep away from any activity where you could bump your nose.</detail><detail>Ice your nose for 20 minutes, every 1 to 2 hours while awake. DO NOT apply ice directly to the skin.</detail><detail>Take pain medicine if necessary.</detail><detail>Keep your head elevated to help reduce swelling and improve breathing. </detail><text>For pain, you can use ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn), or acetaminophen (Tylenol). You can buy these pain medicines at the store.</text><detail>Talk with your provider before using these medicines if you have heart disease, high blood pressure, kidney disease, or have had stomach ulcers or internal bleeding in the past.</detail><detail>DO NOT take more than the amount recommended on the bottle or by your provider. </detail></h2><h2 title="Activity"><text>You can keep doing most daily activities, but use extra care. It may be difficult to exercise strenuously because breathing through your nose may be impaired by swelling. Try not to lift anything heavy unless your provider says it is OK. If you have a cast or splint, wear this until your provider says it is OK to take it off.</text><text>You may have to avoid sports for a while. When your provider tells you it is safe to play again, make sure to wear face and nose guards.</text></h2><h2 title="Self-care at Home "><text>DO NOT remove any packing or splints unless your doctor tells you to.</text><text>Take hot showers to breathe in the steam. This will help ease stuffiness and break up mucus or dried blood that builds up after surgery.</text><text>You may also need to clean the inside of your nose to get rid of dried blood or drainage. Use a cotton swab dipped in warm soapy water and carefully wipe the inside of each nostril.</text><text>If you take any medicines nasally, talk to your provider before using them.</text></h2><h2 title="Follow-up"><text>Follow up with your doctor 1 to 2 weeks after your injury. Based on your injury, your doctor may want to see you more than one time.</text></h2><h2 title="When to Call the Doctor"><text>Call the provider if you have:</text><detail>Sudden numbness or tingling</detail><detail>Sudden increase in pain or swelling</detail><detail>Any open wound or bleeding</detail><detail>Injury does not seem to be healing as expected</detail><detail>Difficulty breathing that does not go away</detail><detail>Any changes in vision or double vision</detail><detail>Worsening headache</detail><detail>Nausea and vomiting</detail><detail>Fever</detail><detail>Foul smelling and/or discolored (yellow, green, or red) drainage from the nose </detail></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>Broken nose</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 4/7/2018"><text>Updated by: Jacob L.

The sprays work well for treating:</text><detail>Allergic rhinitis symptoms, such as congestion, runny nose, sneezing, itching, or swelling of the nasal passageway</detail><detail>Nasal polyps, which are noncancerous (benign) growths in the lining of the nasal passage </detail><text>A nasal corticosteroid spray is different from other nasal sprays you can buy at the store to relieve symptoms of a cold.</text><text>A corticosteroid spray works best when it is used every day. Your health care provider will recommend a daily schedule of the number of sprays for each nostril.</text><text>You may also use the spray only when you need it, or as needed along with regular use. Regular use gives you better results.</text><text>It may take 2 weeks or more for your symptoms to improve. Be patient. Relieving the symptoms can help you feel and sleep better and lessen your symptoms during the day.</text><text>Starting a corticosteroid spray at the beginning of pollen season will work best for decreasing symptoms during that season.</text><text>Several brands of nasal corticosteroid sprays are available. They all have similar effects. Some require a prescription, but you can buy some without one.</text></h2><h2 title="How do you use a Nasal Corticosteroid Spray?"><text>Make sure you understand your dosing instructions. Spray only the number of prescribed sprays in each nostril. Read the package instructions before using your spray the first time.</text><text>Most corticosteroid sprays suggest the following steps:</text><detail>Wash your hands well.</detail><detail>Gently blow your nose to clear the passageway.</detail><detail>Shake the container several times.</detail><detail>Keep your head upright. DO NOT tilt your head back.</detail><detail>Breathe out.</detail><detail>Block one nostril with your finger.</detail><detail>Insert the nasal applicator into the other nostril.</detail><detail>Aim the spray toward the outer wall of the nostril.</detail><detail>Inhale slowly through the nose and press the spray applicator.</detail><detail>Breathe out and repeat to apply the prescribed number of sprays.</detail><detail>Repeat these steps for the other nostril. </detail><text>Avoid sneezing or blowing your nose right after spraying. </text></h2><h2 title="Side Effects"><text>Nasal corticosteroid sprays are safe for all adults. Some types are safe for children (age 2 and older). Pregnant women can safely use corticosteroid sprays.</text><text>The sprays usually work only in the nasal passageway. They do not affect other parts of your body unless you use too much.</text><text>Side effects may include any of these symptoms: </text><detail>Dryness, burning, or stinging in the nasal passage. You can lessen this effect by using the spray after showering or placing your head over a steamy sink for 5 to 10 minutes.</detail><detail>Sneezing.</detail><detail>Throat irritation.</detail><detail>Headaches and nosebleed (uncommon, but report these to your provider right away).</detail><detail>Infection in the nasal passages.</detail><detail>In rare cases, perforation (hole or crack) in the nasal passageway may occur. This can happen if you spray into the middle of your nose instead of toward the outer wall.</detail><text>Make sure you or your child uses the spray exactly as prescribed to avoid side effects. If you or your child uses the spray regularly, ask your provider to examine your nasal passages now and then to make sure problems are not developing.</text></h2><h2 title="When to Call the Doctor"><text>Call your provider if you have:</text><detail>Nasal irritation, bleeding, or other new nasal symptoms</detail><detail>Continued allergy symptoms after repeated use of nasal corticosteroids</detail><detail>Questions or concerns about your symptoms</detail><detail>Trouble using the medicine </detail></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>Steroid nasal sprays; Allergies - nasal corticosteroid sprays</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 11/19/2017"><text>Updated by: Stuart I.

<item><title>Overcoming job stress</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000884.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>Almost everyone feels job stress at times, even if you like your job. You may feel stress about hours, coworkers, deadlines, or possible layoffs. Some stress is motivating and can help you achieve. But when job stress is constant, it can lead to health problems. Finding ways to relieve your stress can help you stay healthy and feel better.</text></h2><h2 title="Causes of Job Stress"><text>Although the cause of job stress is different for every person, there are some common sources of stress in the workplace. These include:</text><detail>Workload. This can include working long hours, having few breaks, or juggling a very heavy workload.</detail><detail>Work roles. It can cause stress if you do not have a clear work role, you have too many roles, or you have to answer to more than one person.</detail><detail>Job conditions. A job that is physically demanding or dangerous can be stressful. So can working at a job that exposes you to loud noise, pollution, or toxic chemicals.</detail><detail>Management. You may feel stress if management does not allow workers a say in making decisions, lacks organization, or has policies that are not family-friendly.</detail><detail>Issues with others. Problems with your boss or coworkers are a common source of stress.</detail><detail>Fear for your future. You may feel stress if you are worried about layoffs or not advancing in your career. </detail></h2><h2 title="How Job Stress Affects Your Health"><text>Like any kind of stress, job stress that continues for a long time can affect your health. Job stress may increase your risk for health problems such as:</text><detail>Heart problems</detail><detail>Back pain</detail><detail>Depression and burnout</detail><detail>Injuries at work</detail><detail>Immune system problems </detail><text>Job stress may also cause troubles at home and in other areas of your life, making your stress worse. </text></h2><h2 title="Signs to Watch for"><text>Job stress may be a problem for you if you have any of these signs:</text><detail>Frequent headaches</detail><detail>Upset stomach</detail><detail>Trouble sleeping</detail><detail>Problems in your personal relationships</detail><detail>Feeling unhappy in your job</detail><detail>Feeling angry often or having a short temper </detail></h2><h2 title="What you can do"><text>You do not need to let job stress take a toll on your health. There are many ways you can learn to manage job stress.</text><detail>Take a break. If you are feeling stressed or angry at work, take a break. Even a short break can help refresh your mind. Take a short walk or have a healthy snack. If you cannot leave your work area, close your eyes for a few moments and breathe deeply.</detail><detail>Create a job description. Creating a job description or reviewing an outdated one can help you gain a better sense of what is expected of you and give you a better sense of control.</detail><detail>Set reasonable goals. DO NOT accept more work than you can reasonably do. Work with your boss and coworkers to set expectations that are realistic. It may help to keep track of what you accomplish every day. Share it with your manager to help set expectations.</detail><detail>Manage technology. Cell phones and email can make it hard to tune out work. Set some limits for yourself, such as turning off your devices during dinner or after a certain time every night.</detail><detail>Take a stand. If your working conditions are dangerous or uncomfortable, work with your boss, management, or employee organizations to resolve the problem. If this does not work, you can report unsafe working conditions to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA).</detail><detail>Get organized. Start each day by creating a to-do list. Rate the tasks in order of importance and work your way down the list.</detail><detail>Do things you enjoy.

<item><title>Outdoor fitness routine</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000891.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>Getting exercise does not have to mean going indoors to the gym. You can get a full workout in your own backyard, local playground, or park.</text></h2><h2 title="Benefits of Outdoor Exercise"><text>Exercising outside can offer many benefits. It can help improve your mood, expose you to vitamin D from the sun, and increase your energy level. It also offers a varied landscape that you DO NOT get indoors. So if you are walking, running, or bicycling, you are more likely to encounter hills. This helps work different muscle groups and increase the intensity of your workout.</text></h2><h2 title="A Complete Workout"><text>Your routine should include 3 types of exercise:</text><detail>Aerobic exercise. This is any kind of exercise that uses your larger muscles and gets your heart beating faster. Aim to get at least 2 hours and 30 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise each week.</detail><detail>Stretching exercises. These exercises stretch your muscles for better flexibility and range of motion in your joints. You can stretch before or after doing your other exercises.</detail><detail>Strength training. These exercises work your muscles to make them stronger and help build stronger bones. Try to work out all of your major muscle groups at least twice a week. Just make sure to rest for a day in between. </detail><text>No matter what type of outdoor workout you choose, include exercises from all 3 groups. Include exercises that target your arms, legs, shoulders, chest, back, and abdominal muscles.</text><text>If you have not been active in a while, or if you have a health condition, it is a good idea to talk with your health care provider before starting an exercise program.</text></h2><h2 title="Ideas for Outdoor Exercise"><text>There are many ways to exercise outdoors, the possibilities are almost endless. Choose something that appeals to you and is right for your level of fitness. Here are some ideas:</text><detail>Warm up first. Get your blood flowing by walking for about 5 minutes. Add a dynamic stretch by bringing your knees up toward your chest. Warming up and stretching your muscles can help prevent some injuries. You should continue with your warm up until your body feels warm and you are just starting to sweat.</detail><detail>Walk or jog to your outdoor gym. Choose a park or playground near your house for your workout. This way you can start, and end, your routine with a brisk walk or light jog.</detail><detail>Choose your props. Park benches, trees, and monkey bars all make great exercise props. Use a park bench for doing pushups, dips, and step-ups. Monkey bars and tree branches are great for pull-ups. Monkey bars can also be used to work your abs by pulling your bent legs up toward your chest as you hang from your hands. You can also wrap resistance bands around trees or poles to do strengthening exercises.</detail><detail>Think full body. When exercising outside, use exercises that use your body weight. For example, you can do squats, lunges, pushups, dips, sit ups, and planks. Do 15 repetitions of each exercise. Build up to 3 sets of 15 repetitions for each exercise.</detail><detail>Join a class or group. Many people feel more motivated when exercising in a group. Look for fitness classes, such as yoga, tai chi, or aerobics, offered outside in local parks and recreation areas. You can also look for groups that focus on a sport you enjoy, such as bicycling, hiking, jogging, rowing, tennis, or Frisbee.</detail><detail>Make chores a workout. Yes, your outdoor chores can count as exercise. A combination of gardening, mowing the lawn with a push mower, pulling weeds, or raking leaves can give you a full body workout.</detail><detail>Mix it up. Keep your workout new by varying your routine every so often. Try a new sport or walk, hike, or jog along a new route. Take a day trip and do your routine somewhere new. </detail></h2><h2 title="Staying Safe"><text>Whenever you exercise outside, you should take a few precautions to make sure you stay safe.</text><detail>Watch the weather. While you can exercise in most types of weather, extreme heat or cold can be dangerous. In cold weather, dress in layers, and wear a hat and gloves. In hot weather, wear plenty of sunscreen, choose lightweight clothing, and drink lots of water.</detail><detail>Use caution on streets. Walk or jog facing oncoming traffic and wear bright clothing so drivers can see you. If you are out when it is dark, wear reflective clothing or carry a flashlight.</detail><detail>Be prepared. Carry an ID and a cell phone, just in case. </detail></h2><h2 title="For More Information"><text>The American Council on Exercise (ACE) has many exercise routines listed on its site -- www.acefitness.org/education-and-resources/lifestyle/exercise-library. </text><text>There are also many books on exercises you can do on your own. You can also get fitness videos or DVDs. Choose books or videos created by people with fitness credentials. Look for someone certified by ACE or the American College of Sports Medicine.</text></h2><h2 title="When to Call the Doctor"><text>Call your provider right away if you have any of the following symptoms during exercise:</text><detail>Pressure or pain in your chest, shoulder, arm, or neck</detail><detail>Feeling sick to your stomach</detail><detail>Severe pain</detail><detail>Trouble breathing or shortness of breath even when you stop exercise</detail><detail>Lightheadedness</detail><detail>A headache, weakness, confusion, or muscle cramps in hot weather</detail><detail>Loss of feeling or stinging on any area of your skin in cold weather </detail></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>Exercise - outdoors</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 4/15/2018"><text>Updated by: Linda J.

<item><title>Omega-3 fats - Good for your heart</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000767.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>Omega-3 fatty acids are a type of polyunsaturated fat. We need these fats to build brain cells and for other important functions. Omega-3s help keep your heart healthy and protected against stroke. They also help improve your heart health if you already have heart disease.</text><text>Your body does not make omega-3 fatty acids on its own. You need to get them from your diet. Certain fish are the best sources of omega-3s. You can also get them from plant foods.</text><text>Omega-3 fatty acids should make up 5% to 10% of your total calories.</text><picname>Omega-3 fatty acids</picname><picurl>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/images/ency/fullsize/19302.jpg</picurl></h2><h2 title="Omega-3s and Your Heart"><text>Omega-3s are good for your heart and blood vessels in several ways.</text><detail>They reduce triglycerides, a type of fat in your blood.</detail><detail>They reduce the risk of developing an irregular heart beat (arrhythmias).</detail><detail>They slow the buildup of plaque in your arteries.</detail><detail>They help to slightly lower your blood pressure.</detail><text>These healthy fats may also help with cancer, depression, inflammation, and ADHD. Health experts are still discovering all the possible benefits of omega-3 fatty acids.</text></h2><h2 title="How Much you can eat"><text>The American Heart Association (AHA) recommends eating at least 2 servings a week of fish rich in omega-3s. A serving is 3.5 ounces (100 grams), which is slightly bigger than a checkbook. Oily fish rich in omega-3s include:</text><detail>Salmon</detail><detail>Mackerel</detail><detail>Albacore tuna</detail><detail>Trout</detail><detail>Sardines </detail></h2><h2 title="Fish and Safety"><text>Some fish can be tainted with mercury and other chemicals. Eating tainted fish can pose health risks for young children and pregnant women.</text><text>If you are concerned about mercury, you can reduce your risk of exposure by eating a variety of fish. </text><text>Pregnant women and children should avoid fish with high levels of mercury. These include:</text><detail>Swordfish</detail><detail>Shark</detail><detail>King mackerel</detail><detail>Tilefish </detail><text>If you are middle-aged or older, the benefits of eating fish outweigh any risks. </text></h2><h2 title="Other Sources of Omega-3s"><text>Oily fish, such as salmon and tuna, contain 2 kinds of omega-3s. These are EPA and DHA. Both have direct benefits for your heart.</text><text>You can get another kind of omega-3, ALA, in some oils, nuts, and plants. ALA benefits your heart, but not as directly as EPA and DHA. Still, eating nuts, seeds, and healthy oils as well as fish can help you get a full range of these healthy fats.</text><text>Plant-based sources of omega-3s include:</text><detail>Ground flaxseeds and flaxseed oil</detail><detail>Walnuts</detail><detail>Chia seeds</detail><detail>Canola oil and soy oil</detail><detail>Soybeans and tofu </detail><text>Of all plant-based foods, ground flaxseeds and flaxseed oil have the highest amount of ALA. You can eat ground flaxseed over granola or in smoothies. Flaxseed oil goes well in salad dressing.</text></h2><h2 title="What About Fish oil Supplements?"><text>Most health experts agree that the best way to reap the benefits of omega-3 is from food. Whole foods contain many nutrients besides omega-3s. These all work together to keep your heart healthy.</text><text>If you already have heart disease or high triglycerides, you may benefit from consuming higher amounts of omega-3 fatty acids. It may be hard to get enough omega-3s through food. Ask your doctor if taking fish oil supplements might be a good idea.</text></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>Cholesterol - omega-3s; Atherosclerosis - omega-3s; Hardening of the arteries - omega-3s; Coronary artery disease - omega-3s; Heart disease - omega-3s</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 4/23/2018"><text>Updated by: Emily Wax, RD, The Brooklyn Hospital Center, Brooklyn, NY.

<item><title>Puberty in girls</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000651.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>

 
Puberty is when your body changes and you develop from being a girl to a woman. Learn what changes to expect so that you feel more prepared.
</text></h2><h2 title="Expect Changes with Puberty"><text>Know that you are going through a growth spurt.</text><text>You have not grown this much since you were a baby. You might grow 2 to 4 inches (5 to 10 centimeters) in a year. When you are done going through puberty, you will be almost as tall as you will be when you are a grown up. Your feet may be the first to grow. They seem really big at first, but you will grow into them.</text><text>Expect to gain weight. This is normal and needed to have healthy menstrual cycles. You will notice that you get curvier, with bigger hips and breasts than when you were a little girl. </text></h2><h2 title="Expect Lots of Body Changes"><text>Your body makes hormones to get puberty started. Here are some changes you will start seeing. You will:</text><detail>Sweat more. You may notice that your armpits smell now. Shower every day and use deodorant.</detail><detail>Start developing breasts. They start as small breast buds under your nipples. Eventually your breasts grow more, and you may want to start wearing a bra. Ask your mom or a trusted adult to take you shopping for a bra.</detail><detail>Grow body hair. You will start getting pubic hair. This is hair on and around your private parts (genitals). It starts out light and thin and gets thicker and darker as you get older. You will also grow hair in your armpits.</detail><detail>Get your period. See "menstrual periods" below.</detail><detail>Get some pimples or acne. This is caused by the hormones that start in puberty. Keep your face clean and use non-oily face cream or sunscreen. Talk to your health care provider if you are having a lot of problems with pimples. </detail></h2><h2 title="Know When Puberty Happens"><text>Most girls go through puberty somewhere between being 8 and 15 years old. There is a wide age range when puberty starts. That is why some kids in 7th grade still look like young children and others look really grown up.</text><text>You may wonder when you will get your period. Usually girls get their period about 2 years after their breasts start to grow. </text></h2><h2 title="Menstrual Periods"><text>Each month, one of your ovaries releases an egg. The egg goes through the fallopian tube into the uterus. </text><text>Each month, the uterus creates a lining of blood and tissue. If the egg is fertilized by a sperm (this is what could happen with unprotected sex), the egg may plant itself into this uterus lining and result in a pregnancy. If the egg is not fertilized, it just passes through the uterus. </text><text>The uterus no longer needs the extra blood and tissue. The blood passes through the vagina as your period. The period usually lasts 2 to 7 days and happens about once a month.</text><text>Be prepared to get your period.</text><text>Talk to your provider about when you might start getting your period. Your provider may be able to tell you, from other changes in your body, when you should expect your period.</text><text>Keep supplies for your period in your backpack or purse. You will want some pads or pantiliners. Being prepared for when you get your period keeps you from being too worried.</text><text>Ask your mother, an older female relative, friend, or someone you trust to help you get supplies. Pads come in all different sizes. They have a sticky side so you can stick them on your underwear. Pantiliners are small, thin pads.</text><text>Once you have your period, you may want to learn how to use tampons. You insert a tampon into your vagina to absorb the blood. The tampon has a string that you use to pull it out. </text><text>Have your mother or a trusted female friend teach you how to use tampons. Change tampons every 4 to 8 hours. </text></h2><h2 title="Be Aware of Mood Swings"><text>

 
You can feel really moody right before you get your period. This is caused by hormones. You might feel:</text><detail>Irritable</detail><detail>Have trouble sleeping</detail><detail>Sad</detail><detail>Less confident about yourself. You may even have trouble figuring out what you want to wear to school.</detail><text>Luckily, feeling moody should go away once you start your period.
</text></h2><h2 title="Accept Changes in Your Body"><text>Try to be comfortable with your body changing. If you are stressed about changes, talk to your parents or a provider that you trust. Avoid dieting to prevent normal weight gain during puberty. Dieting is really unhealthy when you are growing. </text></h2><h2 title="When to Call the Doctor"><text>Talk to your provider if you have:</text><detail>Worries about puberty.</detail><detail>Really long, heavy periods.</detail><detail>Irregular periods that do not seem to get regular.</detail><detail>Lots of pain and cramping with your periods.</detail><detail>Any itching or odor from your private parts. This could be a sign of a yeast infection or a sexually transmitted disease.</detail><detail>A lot of acne. You may be able to use special soap or medicine to help.</detail></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>Well child - puberty in girls; Development - puberty in girls; Menstruation - puberty in girls; Breast development - puberty in girls</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 12/9/2016"><text>Updated by: Neil K.

<item><title>Puberty in boys</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000650.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>

 
Puberty is when your body changes, when you develop from being a boy to a man. Learn what changes to expect so that you feel more prepared.
</text></h2><h2 title="Expect Changes with Puberty"><text>Know that you will go through a growth spurt.</text><text>You have not grown this much since you were a baby. Usually boys start their growth spurt about 2 years after puberty starts. When you are done going through puberty, you will be almost as tall as you will be when you are a grown up.</text><text>Maybe you are worried about how tall you are or how tall you will get. How tall you get depends a lot on how tall your mom and dad are. If they are tall, you are likely to be tall. If they are short, you will probably be short too.</text><text>You will also start building some muscle. Again, you may be worried that other boys seem to be getting bigger faster. But puberty happens for each boy on their own body schedule. You cannot rush it.</text><text>Eat well, sleep well, and stay physically active to help you grow well. Some boys want to lift weights to build muscles. You will not be able to build muscle until you are in puberty. Before puberty, lifting weights will tone your muscles, but you will not build muscles yet. </text></h2><h2 title="Expect Lots of Body Changes"><text>Your body makes hormones to get puberty started. Here are some changes you will start seeing. You will:</text><detail>See your testicles and penis get bigger.</detail><detail>Grow body hair. You may grow hair on your face around your upper lip, cheeks, and chin. You may see hair on your chest and in your armpits. You will also grow pubic hair in your private parts around your genitals. As the hair on your face grows thicker, talk to your parent about shaving.</detail><detail>Notice your voice getting deeper.</detail><detail>Sweat more. You may notice that your armpits smell now. Shower every day and use deodorant.</detail><detail>Get some pimples or acne. Hormones cause this during puberty. Keep your face clean and use non-oily face cream or sunscreen. Talk to your health care provider if you are having a lot of problems with pimples.</detail><detail>Maybe have gynecomastia. This is when your breasts get a little enlarged. This is from hormones during puberty. The gynecomastia should last about 6 months to 2 years. About one half of boys will have it.</detail><text>You will also get erections more often. An erection is when your penis becomes bigger, hard, and stands out from your body. Erections can happen at any time. This is normal.</text><detail>You can have an erection when you are sleeping. Your underwear or bed maybe wet in the morning. You had a "wet dream," or what is called a nocturnal emission. This is when semen comes out of your urethra, the same hole that you pee out of. Wet dreams happen because your testosterone level goes up during puberty. This is all preparing your body to be able to father a child someday.</detail><detail>Know that semen has sperm in it. Sperm is what fertilizes a woman's egg to make a baby.</detail></h2><h2 title="Know When Puberty Happens"><text>Most boys start puberty somewhere between the ages of 9 and 16 years. There is a wide age range when puberty starts. That is why some kids in 7th grade still look like young children and others look really grown up.</text><text>Girls usually start puberty earlier than boys. That is why so many girls are taller than boys in 7th and 8th grade. As adults, many men end up taller than women.</text><text>Accept changes in your body. Try to be comfortable with your body changing. If you are stressed about changes, talk to your parents or a provider that you trust.</text></h2><h2 title="When to Call the Doctor"><text>Call your provider if you are:</text><detail>Having pain or a problem with your penis or testicles</detail><detail>Worried that you are not going into puberty</detail></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>Well child - puberty in boys; Development - puberty in boys</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 12/9/2016"><text>Updated by: Neil K.

<item><title>Protecting yourself from cancer scams</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000847.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>If you or a loved one has cancer, you want to do everything possible to fight the disease. Unfortunately, there are companies who take advantage of this and promote phony cancer treatments that do not work. These treatments come in all forms, from creams and salves to mega-doses of vitamins. Using unproven treatments can be a waste of money. At worst, they can even be harmful. Learn to protect yourself by learning how to spot possible cancer scams.</text></h2><h2 title="How Scams can Hurt you"><text>Using an unproven treatment can be harmful in a few ways:</text><detail>It can delay your use of an approved treatment. When you are treating cancer, time is precious. A delay in treatment can allow the cancer to grow and spread. This can make it harder to treat.</detail><detail>Some of these products interfere with standard cancer treatments, such as chemotherapy or radiation. This can make your treatment less effective.</detail><detail>In some cases, these treatments can be harmful. For example, black salves, touted as a miracle cancer cure, can burn off layers of your skin. </detail></h2><h2 title="How to Spot a Scam"><text>There are some easy ways to spot a cancer treatment scam. Here are a few:</text><detail>The drug or product claims to treat all types of cancer. This is a tip-off because all cancers are different and no one drug can treat them all.</detail><detail>The product includes claims such as "miracle cure," "secret ingredient," "scientific breakthrough," or "ancient remedy."</detail><detail>It is advertised using personal stories from people. In many cases, these are paid actors, but even if they are real, such stories do not prove a product works.</detail><detail>The product includes a money-back guarantee.</detail><detail>The ads for the product use lots of technical or medical jargon.</detail><detail>The product is deemed safe because it is "natural." Not all natural products are safe. And even natural products that are generally safe, like vitamins, may not be safe during cancer treatment.</detail></h2><h2 title="Look for FDA Approval"><text>It is hard to know if a product or drug really works just from reading claims or studies. That is why it is important to use cancer treatments that have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). To get FDA approval, drugs must go through extensive testing to make sure they are effective and safe. Using a cancer treatment that has not been approved by the FDA is risky at best, and can even hurt you.</text><text>Some types of complementary and alternative medicine may help ease the side effects of cancer and its treatment. But none of these treatments have been proven to treat or cure cancer.</text></h2><h2 title="Investigational Drugs"><text>There is a difference between an unproven treatment and investigational drugs. These are drugs that are being studied to see if they work well to treat cancer. People with cancer may take investigational drugs as part of a clinical trial. This is a study to test how well the drug works, and to check its side effects and safety. Clinical trials are the last step before a drug can get approval from the FDA.</text></h2><h2 title="When to Call the Doctor"><text>If you are curious about a cancer treatment you have heard about, your best bet is to ask your health care provider about it. This includes complementary or alternative treatments. Your provider can weigh the medical evidence and help you decide if it is an option for you.

This is an infection of the prostate gland.</text></h2><h2 title="What to Expect"><text>If you have acute prostatitis, your symptoms started quickly. You may still feel ill, with fever, chills, and flushing (skin redness). It may hurt a lot when you urinate for the first few days. The fever and pain should begin improving over the first 36 hours.</text><text>If you have chronic prostatitis, your symptoms are likely to begin slowly and be less severe. Symptoms will probably improve slowly over many weeks.</text></h2><h2 title="Taking Your Antibiotics"><text>It is likely you will have antibiotics to take home. Follow the directions on the bottle carefully. Take the antibiotics at the same time every day.</text><text>For acute prostatitis, antibiotics are taken for 2 to 6 weeks. Chronic prostatitis is treated with antibiotics for 4 to 12 weeks or longer.</text><text>Finish all the antibiotics, even if you start feeling better. It is harder for antibiotics to get into prostate tissue to treat the infection. Taking all of your antibiotics will reduce the chance of the condition returning.</text><text>Antibiotics may cause side effects. These include nausea or vomiting, diarrhea, and other symptoms. Report these to your doctor. DO NOT just stop taking your pills.</text></h2><h2 title="Help With Your Symptoms "><text>Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen or naproxen, may help with pain or discomfort. Ask your doctor if you can take these.</text><text>Warm baths may relieve some of your perineal and lower back pain. </text><text>Avoid substances that irritate the bladder, such as alcohol, caffeinated beverages, citrus juices, and hot or spicy foods.</text><text>Drink plenty of fluids, 64 or more ounces (2 or more liters) per day, if your doctor says this is OK. This helps flush bacteria from the bladder. It can also help prevent constipation.</text><text>To reduce discomfort with bowel movements, you may also:</text><detail>Get some exercise every day. Start slowly and build up at least 30 minutes a day.</detail><detail>Eat foods with high fiber, such as whole grains, fruits, vegetables.</detail><detail>Try tool softeners or fiber supplements. </detail></h2><h2 title="Follow-up "><text>See your health care provider for an exam after you finish taking antibiotics to make sure that the infection is gone.</text><text>If you do not improve or you are having problems with your treatment, talk to your doctor sooner.</text></h2><h2 title="When to Call the Doctor"><text>Call your provider if:</text><detail>You are unable to pass urine at all, or it is very difficult to pass urine.</detail><detail>Fever, chills, or pain do not begin to improve after 36 hours, or they are getting worse. </detail></h2><h2 title="Review Date 8/26/2017"><text>Updated by: Jennifer Sobol, DO, urologist with the Michigan Institute of Urology, West Bloomfield, MI.

Avoid coffee, soft drinks, and alcohol. They can irritate your bladder and urethra, the tube that brings urine from your bladder out of your body.</text><text>Eat a normal, healthy diet with plenty of fiber. You may get constipation from pain medications and being less active. You can use a stool softener or fiber supplement to help prevent this problem.</text><text>Take your medicines as you have been told. You may need to take antibiotics to help prevent infection. Check with your provider before taking aspirin or other over-the-counter pain relievers such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) or acetaminophen (Tylenol).</text><text>You may take showers. But avoid baths if you have a catheter. You can take baths once your catheter is removed. Make sure your provider clears you for baths to make sure your incisions are healing well.</text><text>You will need to make sure your catheter is working properly. You will also need to know how to clean the tube and the area where it attaches to your body. This can prevent infection or skin irritation.</text><text>After your catheter is removed:</text><detail>You may have some urine leakage (incontinence). This should get better over time.

Your health care provider will discuss the benefits and risks of each treatment.</text><text>Sometimes your provider may recommend one treatment for you because of your type of cancer and risk factors. Other times, there may be two or more treatments that could be good for you.</text><text>Factors you and your provider must think about include:</text><detail>Your age and other medical problems you may have</detail><detail>Side effects that occur with each type of treatment</detail><detail>How much the prostate cancer has spread</detail><detail>Your Gleason score, which tells how likely it is that cancer has already spread</detail><detail>Your prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test result </detail><text>Ask your provider to explain these things following about your treatment choices:</text><detail>Which choices offer the best chance of curing your cancer or controlling its spread?</detail><detail>How likely is it that you will have different side effects, and how they will affect your life?</detail></h2><h2 title="Radical Prostatectomy (Prostate Removal)"><text>Radical prostatectomy is a surgery to remove the prostate and some of the surrounding tissue. It is an option when the cancer has not spread beyond the prostate gland.</text><text>Healthy men who will likely live 10 or more years after being diagnosed with prostate cancer often have this procedure.</text><text>Be aware that it is not always possible to know for certain, before surgery, if the cancer has spread beyond the prostate gland.</text><text>Possible problems after surgery include difficulty controlling urine and erection problems. Also, some men need further treatments after this surgery.</text></h2><h2 title="Radiation Therapy"><text>Radiation therapy works best for treating prostate cancer that has not spread outside of the prostate. It may also be used after surgery if there is a risk that cancer cells are still present. Radiation is sometimes used for pain relief when cancer has spread to the bone.</text><text>External beam radiation therapy uses high-powered x-rays pointed at the prostate gland:</text><detail>Before treatment, the radiation therapist uses a special pen to mark the part of the body that is to be treated.</detail><detail>Radiation is delivered to the prostate gland using a machine similar to a regular x-ray machine. The treatment itself is usually painless.</detail><detail>Treatment is done in a radiation oncology center that is usually connected to a hospital.</detail><detail>Treatment is usually done 5 days a week for 6 to 8 weeks. </detail><text>Side effects may include:</text><detail>Appetite loss</detail><detail>Diarrhea</detail><detail>Erection problems</detail><detail>Fatigue</detail><detail>Rectal burning or injury</detail><detail>Skin reactions</detail><detail>Urinary incontinence, the feeling of needing to urinate urgently, or blood in the urine </detail><text>There are reports of secondary cancers arising from the radiation as well.</text><text>Proton therapy is another kind of radiation therapy used to treat prostate cancer. Proton beams target the tumor precisely, so there is less damage to the surrounding tissue. This therapy is not widely accepted or used.</text></h2><h2 title="Prostate Brachytherapy"><text>Brachytherapy is often used for small prostate cancers that are found early and are slow-growing. Brachytherapy may be combined with external beam radiation therapy for more advanced cancers.</text><text>Brachytherapy involves placing radioactive seeds inside the prostate gland.</text><detail>A surgeon inserts small needles through the skin beneath your scrotum to inject the seeds. The seeds are so small that you do not feel them.</detail><detail>The seeds are left in place permanently. </detail><text>Side effects may include:</text><detail>Pain, swelling, or bruising in the penis or scrotum</detail><detail>Red-brown urine or semen</detail><detail>Impotence</detail><detail>Incontinence</detail><detail>Urinary retention</detail><detail>Diarrhea </detail></h2><h2 title="Hormonal Therapy"><text>Testosterone is the main male hormone. Prostate tumors need testosterone to grow. Hormonal therapy is treatment that decreases the effect of testosterone on prostate cancer.</text><text>Hormone therapy is mainly used for cancer that has spread beyond the prostate. The treatment can help relieve symptoms and prevent further growth and spread of cancer. But it does not cure the cancer.</text><text>The main type of hormone therapy is called a luteinizing hormone-releasing hormones (LH-RH) agonist:</text><detail>The medicine blocks the testicles from making testosterone. The drugs must be given by injection, usually every 3 to 6 months.</detail><detail>Possible side effects include nausea and vomiting, hot flashes, anemia, fatigue, thinning bones (osteoporosis), reduced sexual desire, decreased muscle mass, weight gain, and impotence. </detail><text>The other type of hormone medicine is called an androgen-blocking drug:</text><detail>It is often given along with LH-RH drugs to block the effect of testosterone produced by the adrenal glands, which make a small amount of testosterone.</detail><detail>Possible side effects include erection problems, reduced sexual desire, liver problems, diarrhea, and enlarged breasts. </detail><text>Much of the body's testosterone is made by the testes. As a result, surgery to remove the testes (called orchiectomy) can also be used as a hormonal treatment.</text></h2><h2 title="Chemotherapy"><text>Chemotherapy and immunotherapy (medicine that helps the body's immune system fight the cancer) may be used to treat prostate cancer that no longer responds to hormone treatment. Usually a single drug or a combination of drugs is recommended.</text></h2><h2 title="Cryotherapy"><text>Cryotherapy uses very cold temperatures to freeze and kill prostate cancer cells. The goal of cryosurgery is to destroy the entire prostate gland and possibly surrounding tissue.</text><text>Cryosurgery is generally not used as a first treatment for prostate cancer.</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 10/10/2017"><text>Updated by: Jennifer Sobol, DO, Urologist with the Michigan Institute of Urology, West Bloomfield, MI.

<item><title>Prostate cancer staging</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000397.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>Cancer staging is a way to describe how much cancer is in your body and where it is located in your body.

This is also called clinical staging. </text><text>PSA refers to a protein made by the prostate measured by a lab test. </text><detail>A higher level of PSA can indicate a more advanced cancer.</detail><detail>The doctors will also look at how fast the PSA levels have been increasing from test to test. A faster increase could show a more aggressive tumor. </detail><text>A prostate biopsy is done in your doctor's office. The results can indicate:</text><detail>How much of the prostate is involved.</detail><detail>The Gleason score. A number from 2 to 10 that shows how closely the cancer cells look like normal cells when viewed under a microscope. Scores less than 6 suggest the cancer is slow growing and not aggressive. Higher numbers indicate a faster growing cancer that is more likely to spread. </detail><text>Imaging tests such as a CT scan, MRI, or bone scan also may be done.</text><text>Using the results from these tests, your doctor can tell you your clinical stage. At times, this is enough information to make decisions about your treatment.</text><text>Surgical staging (pathological staging) is based on what your doctor finds if you have surgery to remove the prostate and perhaps some of the lymph nodes. Lab tests are done on the tissue that's removed. </text><text>This staging helps determine what other treatment you may need might. It also helps predict what to expect after treatment ends.</text></h2><h2 title="What the Stages Mean"><text>The higher the stage, the more advanced the cancer.</text><text>Stage I cancer. The cancer is found only in only one part of the prostate. Stage I is called localized prostate cancer. It cannot be felt during a digital rectal exam or seen with imaging tests. If the PSA is less than 10 and the Gleason score is 6 or less, Stage I cancer is likely to grow slowly.</text><text>Stage II cancer. The cancer is more advanced than stage I. It has not spread beyond the prostate and is still called localized. The cells are less normal than cells in stage I, and may grow more rapidly. There are two types of stage II prostate cancer:</text><detail>Stage IIA is most likely found in only one side of the prostate.</detail><detail>Stage IIB may be found in both sides of the prostate. </detail><text>Stage III cancer. The cancer has spread outside the prostate into local tissue. It may have spread into the seminal vesicles. These are the glands that make semen. Stage III is called locally advanced prostate cancer.</text><text>Stage IV cancer. The cancer has spread to distant parts of the body. It could be in nearby lymph nodes or bones, most often of the pelvis or spine. Other organs such as bladder, liver, or lungs can be involved.</text><text>Staging along with the PSA value and Gleason score help you and your doctor decide on the best treatment, taking into account:</text><detail>Your age</detail><detail>Your overall health</detail><detail>Your symptoms (if you have any)</detail><detail>Your feelings about side effects of treatment</detail><detail>The chance that treatment can cure your cancer or help you in other ways </detail><text>With stage I, II, or III prostate cancer, the main goal is to cure the cancer by treating it and keeping it from coming back. With stage IV, the goal is to improve symptoms and prolong life. In most cases, stage IV prostate cancer cannot be cured.</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 8/26/2017"><text>Updated by: Jennifer Sobol, DO, urologist with the Michigan Institute of Urology, West Bloomfield, MI.

<item><title>Prostate cancer screening</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000846.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>Cancer screenings can help find signs of cancer early, before you notice any symptoms. In many cases, finding cancer early makes it easier to treat or cure. However, at present it is not clear if screening for prostate cancer is helpful for most men. For this reason, you should speak with your health care provider before having a prostate cancer screening.</text></h2><h2 title="Types of Screenings"><text>Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test is a blood test that checks the level of PSA in your blood.</text><detail>In some cases, a high level of PSA could mean you have prostate cancer.</detail><detail>But other conditions can also cause a high level, such as infection in the prostate or an enlarged prostate. You may need another test to find out if you have cancer.</detail><detail>Other blood tests or a prostate biopsy can help diagnose a cancer if the PSA test is high.</detail><text>Digital rectal exam (DRE) is a test in which your provider inserts a lubricated, gloved finger into your rectum. This allows the provider to check the prostate for lumps or unusual areas. Most cancers cannot be felt with this type of exam, at least in the early stages.&lt;br&gt;</text><text>Imaging tests, such as an ultrasound or an MRI, are not accurate for screening prostate cancer.</text></h2><h2 title="Benefits and Risks of Screenings"><text>The benefit of any cancer screening test is to find cancer early, when it easier to treat. But the value of PSA screening for prostate cancer is debated. No single answer fits all men.</text><text>For some men 55 through 69 years old, screening may help reduce the chance of death from prostate cancer. However, for many men, screening and treatment can be harmful instead of beneficial. </text><text>Prostate cancer often grows very slowly. PSA levels can begin to rise years before a cancer causes any symptoms or problems. It is also very common as men age. In many cases, the cancer will not cause any problems or shorten a man's life span.</text><text>For these reasons, it is not clear if the benefits of routine screenings outweigh the risks or side effects of being treated for prostate cancer once it is found.</text><text>There are other factors to think about before having a PSA test:</text><detail>Anxiety. Elevated PSA levels do not always mean you have cancer. These results and the need for further testing can cause a lot of fear and anxiety, even if you do not have prostate cancer.</detail><detail>Side effects from further testing. If your PSA test is higher than normal, you may need to have a one or more biopsies to find out for sure. A biopsy is safe, but can cause problems such as an infection, pain, fever, or blood in the semen or urine.</detail><detail>Overtreatment. Many prostate cancers will not affect your normal life span. But since it is impossible to know for sure, most people want to get treatment.</detail><detail>Side effects of treatment. Cancer treatment can have serious side effects, including problems with erections and urinating. These side effects can cause more problems than the untreated cancer.</detail></h2><h2 title="Who Needs Screenings"><text>Measuring the PSA level can increase the chance of finding prostate cancer when it is very early. But there is debate over the value of the PSA test for detecting prostate cancer. No single answer fits all men.</text><text>If you're 55 through 69 years old, before having the test, talk to your provider about the pros and cons of having a PSA test. Ask about:</text><detail>Whether screening decreases your chance of dying from prostate cancer</detail><detail>Whether there is any harm from prostate cancer screening, such as side effects from testing or overtreatment of cancer when discovered</detail><detail>Whether you have a higher risk of prostate cancer than others</detail><text>Men younger than age 55 have a higher chance of developing prostate cancer and should talk with their provider about PSA screening if they:</text><detail>Have a family history of prostate cancer (especially a brother or father)</detail><detail>Are African American</detail><text>For men older than age 70, recommendations are against screening at all or only screening men who appear to for those who seem to have a longer life expectancy.

"><text>Your baby is growing bigger, which can make it hard to find a good sleeping position. If you have always been a back- or stomach-sleeper, you might have trouble getting used to sleeping on your side (as health care providers recommend). Also, shifting around in bed becomes harder as you get bigger.</text><text>Other things that may keep you from sleeping include:</text><detail>More trips to the bathroom. Your kidneys are working harder to filter the extra blood your body is making. This results in more urine. Also, as your baby grows, there is more pressure on your bladder. This means a lot more trips to the bathroom.</detail><detail>Increased heart rate. Your heart rate increases during pregnancy to pump more blood. This may make it harder to sleep.</detail><detail>Shortness of breath. At first, pregnancy hormones can make you breathe more deeply. This might make you feel like you're working harder to get air. Also, as the baby takes up more space, it can put more pressure on your diaphragm (the muscle just below your lungs).</detail><detail>Aches and pains.Pains in your legs or back are caused in part by the extra weight you are carrying.</detail><detail>Heartburn. During pregnancy, the entire digestive system slows down. Food stays in the stomach and bowels longer. This may cause heartburn, which is often worse at night. Constipation may also occur.</detail><detail>Stress and dreams. Many pregnant women worry about the baby or about becoming a parent, which can make it hard to sleep. Vivid dreams and nightmares are common during pregnancy. Dreaming and worrying more than usual is normal, but try not to let it keep you up at night. </detail></h2><h2 title="How can I get Comfortable?"><text>Try sleeping on your side. Lying on your side with your knees bent will likely be the most comfortable position. It makes it easier for your heart to pump because it keeps the baby from putting pressure on the large vein that carries blood back to the heart from your legs. </text><text>Many providers tell pregnant women to sleep on the left side. Sleeping on the left side also improves blood flow among the heart, fetus, uterus, and kidneys. It also keeps pressure off your liver. If your left hip becomes too uncomfortable, it is OK to switch to your right side for a while. It is best not to sleep flat on your back. </text><text>Try using pillows under your belly or between your legs. Also, using a bunched-up pillow or rolled-up blanket at the small of your back may relieve some pressure. You can also try an egg crate type of mattress on your side of the bed to give some relief for sore hips. It also helps to have extra pillows available to support your body.</text></h2><h2 title="More Sleeping Tips"><text>These tips will safely improve your chances of getting a good night's sleep.</text><detail>Cut out or limit drinks like soda, coffee, and tea. These drinks have caffeine and will make it harder for you to sleep.</detail><detail>Avoid drinking a lot of fluids or eating a big meal within a few hours of going to bed. Some women find it helpful to eat a big breakfast and lunch, then have a smaller dinner.</detail><detail>If nausea keeps you up, eat a few crackers before you go to bed.</detail><detail>Try going to bed and waking up at the same time each day.</detail><detail>Avoid exercise right before you go to bed.</detail><detail>Do something to relax before you go to bed. Try soaking in a warm bath for 15 minutes, or having a warm, caffeine-free drink, like milk.</detail><detail>If a leg cramp wakes you up, press your feet hard against the wall or stand on the leg.</detail><detail>Take short naps during the day to make up for lost sleep at night. </detail><text>If stress or anxiety about becoming a parent is keeping you from getting a good night's sleep, try:</text><detail>Taking a childbirth class to help you prepare for the life changes ahead</detail><detail>Talking to your provider about techniques to deal with stress </detail></h2><h2 title="Can I Take Anything to Help me Sleep?"><text>DO NOT take any sleep aids. This includes over-the-counter medicines and herbal products. They are not recommended for pregnant women.

<item><title>Preventing stroke</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000678.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>A stroke occurs when the blood flow is cut off to any part of the brain. The loss of blood flow can be caused by a blood clot in an artery of the brain. It can also be caused by a blood vessel in a part of the brain that becomes weak and bursts open. A stroke is sometimes called a "brain attack."</text></h2><h2 title="What are risk factors and preventive care?"><text>A risk factor is something that increases your chance of having a stroke. You can't change some risk factors for stroke. But some, you can. </text><text>Changing risk factors that you can control will help you live a longer, healthier life.

<item><title>Preventing pressure ulcers</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000147.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>Pressure ulcers are also called bedsores, or pressure sores. They can form when your skin and soft tissue press against a harder surface, such as a chair or bed, for a prolonged time. This pressure reduces blood supply to that area. Lack of blood supply can cause the skin tissue in this area to become damaged or die. When this happens, a pressure ulcer may form.</text><text>You have a risk of developing a pressure ulcer if you:</text><detail>Spend most of your day in a bed or a chair with minimal movement</detail><detail>Are overweight or underweight</detail><detail>Are not able to control your bowels or bladder</detail><detail>Have decreased feeling in an area of your body</detail><detail>Spend a lot of time in one position </detail><text>You will need to take steps to prevent these problems.</text></h2><h2 title="Self-care"><text>You, or your caregiver, need to check your body every day from head to toe.

DO NOT scrub hard.</detail><detail>Use moisturizing cream and skin protectants on your skin every day.</detail><detail>Clean and dry areas underneath your breasts and in your groin.</detail><detail>DO NOT use talc powder or strong soaps.</detail><detail>Try not to take a bath or shower every day. It can dry out your skin more. </detail><text>Eat enough calories and protein to stay healthy. </text><text>Drink plenty of water every day.</text><text>Make sure your clothes are not increasing your risk of developing pressure ulcers:</text><detail>Avoid clothes that have thick seams, buttons, or zippers that press on your skin.</detail><detail>DO NOT wear clothes that are too tight.</detail><detail>Keep your clothes from bunching up or wrinkling in areas where there is any pressure on your body. </detail><text>After urinating or having a bowel movement:</text><detail>Clean the area right away.

Your diabetes may increase your risk for problems during or after your surgery, such as:</text><detail>Infection after surgery</detail><detail>Healing slower</detail><detail>Fluid, electrolyte, and kidney problems</detail><detail>Heart problems</detail></h2><h2 title="Before Surgery"><text>Work with your health care provider to come up with the safest surgery plan for you.</text><text>Focus more on controlling your diabetes during the days to weeks before surgery.</text><text>Your provider will do a medical exam and talk to you about your health.</text><detail>Tell your provider about all the medicines you are taking.</detail><detail>If you take metformin, talk to your provider about stopping it.

<item><title>Preparing children for pregnancy and a new baby</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000635.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>

 
A new baby changes your family. It is an exciting time. But a new baby can be hard for your older child or children. Learn how you can help your older child get ready for a new baby.
</text></h2><h2 title="Tell Your Child about the New Baby"><text>Tell your child that you are pregnant when you are ready to share the news. Try to let them know before everyone around them is talking about it.</text><text>Know that your child will notice that you feel tired or sick. Try to stay positive so your child will not resent the baby for making you feel bad. </text></h2><h2 title="Be Prepared to Answer Questions "><text>Let your child decide how much they want to know and how much they want to talk about the baby.</text><text>Be prepared for your child to ask, "Where does the baby come from?" Know what you are comfortable talking about. Keep the conversation at their level and answer their questions. You can:</text><detail>Tell them that the baby comes from inside the uterus that is behind your belly.</detail><detail>Read kid's books about childbirth with your child.</detail><detail>Bring your child to a doctor's appointment. Let your child hear the baby's heartbeat.</detail><detail>Let your child feel the baby when the baby kicks or moves.</detail><text>Understand your child's sense of time. A young child will not understand that the baby will not come for months. Explain your due date with times that make sense to your child. For example, tell them that the baby is coming when it gets cold out or when it gets hot out.</text><text>Try not to ask your child if they want a brother or sister. If the baby is not what they want, they may be disappointed.</text></h2><h2 title="Know That Your Child is Tuned In to You"><text>As your belly gets bigger, your child will notice:</text><detail>They cannot sit on your lap anymore.</detail><detail>You are not picking them up very much.</detail><detail>You are low in energy.</detail><text>Explain to them that having a baby is hard work. Reassure them that you are OK and that they are still very important to you.</text></h2><h2 title="Handle Your Child's Emotions and Behavior"><text>Know that your child may get clingy. Your child may act up. Set limits with your child as you always have. Be caring and let your child know they are still important. Below are some things that you can do.</text><text>Your child likes to hear about themselves. Show your child pictures of when you were pregnant with them and pictures of them as a baby. Tell your child stories of what you did with them as a baby. Tell your child how excited you were when they were born. Help your child see that this is what having a new baby is like.</text><text>Encourage your child to play with a doll. Your child can feed, diaper, and care for the baby doll. Let your child play with some of the baby things. Your child may want to dress their stuffed animals or dolls in the clothes. Tell your child they can help do this with the real baby.</text><text>Try to keep to your child's regular routines as much as possible. Let your child know the things that will stay the same after the baby comes, such as:</text><detail>Going to school</detail><detail>Going to the playground</detail><detail>Playing with their favorite toys</detail><detail>Reading books with you </detail><text>Avoid telling your child to act like a big boy or a big girl. Remember that your child thinks of themselves as your baby. </text></h2><h2 title="Try Not to Make Big Changes "><text>DO NOT push potty training right before or right after the baby is born.</text><text>DO NOT push your child to give up their baby blanket.</text><text>If you are moving your child to a new room or to a new bed, do this, weeks before your due date. Give your child time to make the change before the baby comes. </text></h2><h2 title="Get Prepared for the Birth of Your Baby"><text>Ask your child to help get ready for the new baby. Your child can help:</text><detail>Pack your suitcase for the hospital.</detail><detail>Pick out the baby's coming-home clothes.</detail><detail>Get the new baby's crib or room ready. Set out clothes and arrange the diapers.</detail><detail>You shop for baby things. </detail><text>Make arrangements for your older child. Tell your child who will take care of them when you have the baby. Let your child know that you will not be gone for long.</text><text>Plan for your child to visit you and the new baby in the hospital. Have your child visit when there are not a lot of other visitors. On the day that you take the baby home, have your older child come to the hospital to "help."</text><text>For younger children, a small gift (a toy or stuffed animal) "from the baby" is often helpful to help the child deal with the family adding a new baby.</text><text>Let your child know what the baby will do:</text><detail>Where the baby will sleep</detail><detail>Where the baby car seat will go in the car</detail><detail>How the baby will breastfeed or take a bottle every few hours </detail><text>Also explain what the baby cannot do. The baby cannot talk, but they can cry. And the baby cannot play because they are too little. But the baby will like watching your child play, dance, sing, and jump. </text></h2><h2 title="At Home with the New Baby"><text>Try to spend a little time each day with the older child. Do this when the baby is napping or when another adult can watch the baby.</text><text>Encourage your child to help with the baby. Know that this takes longer than doing it yourself. Your child can:</text><detail>Sing to the baby</detail><detail>Help with diaper changes</detail><detail>Help push the stroller</detail><detail>Talk to the baby </detail><text>Ask visitors to play and talk with the older child as well as visit with the new baby. Let your child open the baby's gifts.</text><text>When you breastfeed or bottle-feed your baby, read a story, sing, or cuddle with your older child too.</text><text>Know that your child will have mixed feelings about the new baby.</text><detail>They may start talking in baby talk. They may act out.</detail><detail>Help your child talk about their feelings about the new baby. </detail></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>Siblings - new baby; Older children - new baby; Prenatal care - preparing children</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 12/9/2016"><text>Updated by: Neil K.

Health care providers can also test a fetus (unborn baby) to see if the baby will have a genetic disorder, such as cystic fibrosis or Down syndrome.</text></h2><h2 title="Who may Want Prenatal Genetic Counseling?"><text>It is up to you whether or not to have prenatal genetic counseling and testing. You will want to think about your personal desires, religious beliefs, and family circumstances.</text><text>Some people have a greater risk than others for passing on genetic disorders to their children. They are:</text><detail>People who have family members or children with genetic or birth defects.</detail><detail>Jews of Eastern European descent.

Ask questions you may have about the test and what the results will mean for you.</text></h2><h2 title="What Will Counseling and Tests Tell me?"><text>Keep in mind that genetic tests that are done before you get pregnant (conceive) can most often only tell you the odds of having a child with a certain birth defect. For instance, you may learn that you and your partner have a 1 in 4 chance of having a child with a certain disease or defect.</text><text>If you decide to conceive, you will need more tests to see if your baby will have the defect or not.</text><text>For those who may be at risk, test results can help answer such questions as:</text><detail>Are the chances of having a baby with a genetic defect so high that we should look at other ways to start a family?</detail><detail>If you have a baby with a genetic disorder, are there treatments or surgeries that can help the baby?</detail><detail>How do we prepare ourselves for the chance we might have a child with a genetic problem? Are there classes or support groups for the disorder? Are there providers nearby who treat children with the disorder?</detail><detail>Should we continue the pregnancy? Are the baby's problems so severe that we might choose to end the pregnancy? </detail></h2><h2 title="What Will Happen?"><text>You can prepare by finding out if any medical problems like these run in your family:</text><detail>Child development problems</detail><detail>Miscarriages</detail><detail>Stillbirth</detail><detail>Severe childhood illnesses </detail><text>Steps in prenatal genetic counseling include:</text><detail>You will fill out an in-depth family history form and talk to the counselor about health problems that run in your family.</detail><detail>You may also get blood tests to look at your chromosomes or other genes.</detail><detail>Your family history and test results will help the counselor look at genetic defects you may pass on to your children. </detail><text>If you choose to be tested after you become pregnant, tests that may be done during the pregnancy (either on the mother or fetus) include:</text><detail>Amniocentesis, in which fluid is withdrawn from the amniotic sac (fluid that surrounds the baby).</detail><detail>Chorionic villus sampling (CVS), which takes a sample of the cells from the placenta.</detail><detail>Percutaneous umbilical blood sampling (PUBS), which tests blood from the umbilical cord (the cord that connects the mother to the baby).</detail><detail>Noninvasive prenatal screening, which looks in the mother's blood for DNA from the baby that may have an extra or missing chromosome. </detail><text>These tests have some risks. They may cause infection, harm the fetus, or cause a miscarriage. If you are worried about these risks, talk to your provider.</text></h2><h2 title="What if I Carry a Genetic Disorder?"><text>The purpose of prenatal genetic counseling is simply to help parents make informed decisions. A genetic counselor will help you figure out how to use the information you get from your tests. If you are at risk, or if you find out that your baby has a disorder, your counselor and provider will talk to you about options and resources. But the decisions are yours to make.</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 1/10/2018"><text>Updated by: Anna C.

A lot of your body's energy is directed toward supporting a rapidly growing fetus. It's common to feel the need to reduce your activities and your work load, and to get some rest during the day.</text><text>Heartburn and low back pain are also common complaints at this time in pregnancy. When you're pregnant, your digestive system slows down. This can cause heartburn as well as constipation.

This is a common problem in pregnancy, although easy to fix. </text><text>Glucose tolerance testing. Checks for signs of diabetes which can begin during pregnancy. In this test, your doctor will give you a sweet liquid. An hour later, your blood will be drawn to check your blood sugar levels.

<item><title>Premature rupture of membranes</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000512.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>Amniotic fluid is the water that surrounds your baby in the womb. Membranes or layers of tissue hold in this fluid. This membrane is called the amniotic sac.</text><text>Often, the membranes rupture (break) during labor. This is often called "when the water breaks."</text><text>Sometimes the membranes break before a woman goes into labor. When the water breaks early, it is called premature rupture of membranes (PROM). Most women will go into labor on their own within 24 hours.</text><text>If the water breaks before the 37th week of pregnancy, it is called preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM). The earlier your water breaks, the more serious it is for you and your baby.</text></h2><h2 title="Why Does PROM Happen?"><text>In most cases, the cause of PROM is unknown. Some causes or risk factors may be:</text><detail>Infections of the uterus, cervix, or vagina</detail><detail>Too much stretching of the amniotic sac (this may happen if there is too much fluid, or more than one baby putting pressure on the membranes)</detail><detail>Smoking</detail><detail>If you have had surgery or biopsies of the cervix</detail><detail>If you were pregnant before and had a PROM or PPROM </detail><text>Most women whose water breaks before labor do not have a risk factor.</text></h2><h2 title="How do I Know I Have it?"><text>The biggest sign to watch for is fluid leaking from the vagina. It may leak slowly, or it may gush out. Some of the fluid is lost when the membranes break. The membranes may continue to leak.</text><text>Sometimes when fluid leaks out slowly, women mistake it for urine. If you notice fluid leaking, use a pad to absorb some of it. Look at it and smell it. Amniotic fluid usually has no color and does not smell like urine (it has a much sweeter smell).</text><text>If you think your membranes have ruptured, call your health care provider right away. You will need to be checked as soon as possible.</text></h2><h2 title="What Will Happen?"><text>At the hospital, simple tests can confirm that your membranes have ruptured. Your provider will check your cervix to see if it has softened and is starting to dilate (open up).</text><text>If your doctor finds that you have PROM, you will need to be in the hospital until your baby is born.</text><text>AFTER 37 WEEKS</text><text>If your pregnancy is past 37 weeks, your baby is ready to be born. You will need to go into labor soon. The longer it takes for labor to start, the greater your chance of getting an infection.</text><text>You can either wait for a short while until you go into labor on your own, or you can be induced (get medicine to start labor). Women who deliver within 24 hours after their water breaks are less likely to get an infection. So, if labor is not starting on its own, it can be safer to be induced.</text><text>BETWEEN 34 AND 37 WEEKS</text><text>If you are between 34 and 37 weeks when your water breaks, your provider will likely suggest that you be induced. It is safer for the baby to be born a few weeks early than it is for you to risk an infection.</text><text>BEFORE 34 WEEKS</text><text>If your water breaks before 34 weeks, it is more serious. If there are no signs of infection, the provider may try to hold off your labor by putting you on bed rest. Steroid medicines are given to help the baby's lungs grow quickly. The baby will do better if its lungs have more time to grow before being born.</text><text>You will also receive antibiotics to help prevent infections. You and your baby will be watched very closely in the hospital. Your provider may do tests to check your baby's lungs. When the lungs have grown enough, your provider will induce labor.</text></h2><h2 title="What if I Have to Deliver My Baby Preterm (Early)?"><text>If your water breaks early, your provider will tell you what will be the safest thing to do. There are some risks to giving birth early, but the hospital where you deliver will send your baby to the preterm unit (a special unit for babies born early). If there is not a preterm unit where you deliver, you and your baby will be moved to a hospital that has one.</text></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>PROM; PPROM; Pregnancy complications - premature rupture</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 4/19/2018"><text>Updated by: John D.

Kidney damage results in the presence of protein in the urine. Preeclampsia that occurs in women after the 20th week of pregnancy. It can be mild or severe. Preeclampsia usually resolves after the baby is born and the placenta is delivered. However, it may persist or even begin after delivery, most often within 48 hours. This is called postpartum preeclampsia.</text></h2><h2 title="What to Expect "><text>Treatment decisions are made based on the gestational age of the pregnancy and the severity of the preeclampsia. </text><text>If you are past 37 weeks and have been diagnosed with preeclampsia, your health care provider will likely advise you to deliver early. This may involve receiving medicines to start (induce) labor or delivering the baby by cesarean delivery (C-section).</text><text>If you are less than 37 weeks pregnant, the goal is to prolong your pregnancy as long as it is safe. Doing so allows your baby to develop longer inside of you.</text><detail>How quickly you should be delivered depends on how high your blood pressure is, signs of liver or kidney problems, and the condition of the baby.</detail><detail>If your preeclampsia is severe, you may need to stay in the hospital to be monitored closely. If the preeclampsia remains severe, you may need to be delivered.</detail><detail>If your preeclampsia is mild, you may be able to stay at home on bed rest.

<item><title>Prediabetes</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000778.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>Prediabetes occurs when the level of sugar (glucose) in your blood is too high, but not high enough to be called diabetes. </text><text>If you have prediabetes, you are at a much higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes within 10 years. It also greatly increases your risk for heart disease. </text><text>Losing extra weight and getting regular exercise CAN often stop prediabetes from becoming full-blown diabetes. </text></h2><h2 title="About Prediabetes"><text>Your body gets energy from the glucose in your blood. A hormone called insulin helps the cells in your body use glucose. If you have prediabetes, this process does not work as well. Glucose builds up in your bloodstream. If the levels get high enough, you can develop type 2 diabetes.</text><text>Having diabetes increases the risk for certain health problems. This is because high glucose levels in the blood can damage the blood vessels and nerves. This can lead to heart disease and stroke. If you have prediabetes, damage may already be occurring in your blood vessels. </text><text>Having prediabetes is a wake-up call to take action to improve your health.</text></h2><h2 title="How to Help Prevent Diabetes "><text>Your health care provider will talk with you about your condition and your risks from prediabetes. To help you prevent diabetes, your provider will likely suggest certain lifestyle changes:</text><detail>Eat healthy foods. This includes whole grains, lean proteins, low-fat dairy, and plenty of fruits and vegetables. Watch portion sizes and avoid sweets and fried foods. </detail><detail>Lose weight. Just a small weight loss can make a big difference in your health. For example, your provider may suggest that you lose about 7% of your body weight. So, if you weigh 200 pounds (90 kilograms), your goal would be to lose about 14 pounds (6.3 kilograms). Your provider may suggest a diet or you can join a program to help you lose weight.</detail><detail>Get more exercise. Aim to get at least 30 to 60 minutes of moderate exercise at least 5 days a week. This can include brisk walking, riding your bike, or swimming. You can also break up exercise into smaller sessions throughout the day.</detail><detail>Take medicines as directed. Depending on your other risk factors, your provider may prescribe medicines to lower cholesterol or blood pressure or to help prevent diabetes.</detail></h2><h2 title="Risk Factors "><text>You can't tell that you have prediabetes because it has no symptoms. The only way to know is through a blood test. Your provider will test your blood sugar if you are at risk for diabetes. The risk factors for prediabetes are the same as those for type 2 diabetes.</text><text>You should get tested for prediabetes if you are age 45 or older. If you are younger than 45, you should get tested if you are overweight or obese and have one or more of these risk factors:</text><detail>A previous diabetes test showing diabetes risk</detail><detail>Family history of diabetes</detail><detail>Inactive lifestyle and lack of regular exercise</detail><detail>African American, Hispanic/Latin American, American Indian and Alaska Native, Asian American, or Pacific Islander ethnicity</detail><detail>High blood pressure (140/90 mm Hg or higher)</detail><detail>Low HDL (good) cholesterol and high triglycerides</detail><detail>History of heart disease</detail><detail>History of diabetes during pregnancy (gestational diabetes)</detail><detail>History of delivering a baby weighing more than 9 pounds (4 kilograms)</detail><detail>Polycystic ovary syndrome</detail></h2><h2 title="Follow-Up Testing"><text>If your blood test results show that you have prediabetes, your provider may suggest that you be retested once each year. If your results are normal, your provider may suggest getting retested every 3 years.</text></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>Impaired fasting glucose - prediabetes; Impaired glucose tolerance - prediabetes</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 5/21/2017"><text>Updated by: Laura J.

The posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) is located inside your knee joint and connects the bones of your upper and lower leg.</text><text>A PCL injury occurs when the ligament is stretched or torn. A partial PCL tear occurs when only part of the ligament is torn. A complete PCL tear occurs when the entire ligament is torn into two pieces.</text></h2><h2 title="More About Your Injury"><text>The PCL is one of several ligaments that keep your knee stable. The PCL helps keep your leg bones in place and allows your knee to move back and forth. It is the strongest ligament in the knee. PCL tears often occur as a result of a severe knee injury.</text><text>Injuring the PCL takes a lot of force. It can occur if you:</text><detail>Get hit very hard on the front of your knee, such as hitting your knee on the dashboard during a car accident</detail><detail>Fall hard on a bent knee</detail><detail>Bend the knee too far backward (hyperflexion)</detail><detail>Land the wrong way after jumping </detail><detail>Dislocate your knee</detail><text>PCL injuries commonly occur with other knee damage, including injuries to the nerves and blood vessels.

<item><title>Post surgical pain treatment - adults</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000406.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>Pain that occurs after surgery is an important concern. Before your surgery, you and your surgeon may have discussed how much pain you should expect and how it will be managed.</text><text>Several factors determine how much pain you have and how to manage it:</text><detail>Different types of surgeries and surgical cuts (incisions) cause different types and amounts of pain afterward.</detail><detail>A longer and more invasive surgery, besides causing more pain, can take more out of you. Recovering from these other effects of surgery can make it harder to deal with the pain.</detail><detail>Each person feels and reacts to pain differently. </detail><text>Controlling your pain is important for your recovery. Good pain control is needed so you can get up and begin to move around. This is important because:</text><detail>It lowers your risk for blood clots in your legs or lungs, as well as lung and urinary infections.</detail><detail>You will have a shorter hospital stay so that you go home sooner, where you are likely to recover more quickly.</detail><detail>You are less likely to have lingering chronic pain problems. </detail></h2><h2 title="Your Role in Controlling the Pain"><text>There are many types of pain medicines. Depending on the surgery and your overall health, you may receive a single medicine or a combination of medicines.</text><text>Studies show that people who use pain medicine after surgery to control pain often use fewer pain medicines than those who try to avoid pain medicine.</text><text>Your job as a patient is to tell your health care providers when you are having pain and if the medicines you are receiving control your pain. Providers will always be busy, but do not worry about bothering them. Speak up. In the end, you are the one in control of your pain.</text></h2><h2 title="Patient Controlled Anesthesia (PCA)"><text>Right after surgery, you may receive pain medicines directly into your veins through an intravenous (IV) line. This line runs through a pump. The pump is set to give you a certain amount of pain medicine.</text><text>Often, you can push a button to give yourself more pain relief when you need it. This is called patient controlled anesthesia (PCA) because you manage how much extra medicine you receive. It is programmed so you cannot give yourself too much.</text></h2><h2 title="Epidural Pain Control"><text>Epidural pain medicines are delivered through a soft tube (catheter). The tube is inserted into your back into the small space just outside the spinal cord. The pain medicine can be given to you continuously or in small doses through the tube.</text><text>You may come out of surgery with this catheter already in place. Or a doctor (anesthesiologist) inserts the catheter into your lower back while you lay on your side in the hospital bed after your surgery.</text><text>Risks of epidural blocks are rare but may include:</text><detail>Drop in blood pressure. Fluids are given through a vein (IV) to help keep your blood pressure stable.</detail><detail>Headache, dizziness, difficulty breathing, or seizure. </detail></h2><h2 title="Pain Pills or Shots"><text>Narcotic pain medicine taken as pills or given as a shot may provide enough pain relief. You may receive this medicine right away after surgery. More often, you receive it when you no longer need epidural or continuous IV medicine.</text><text>Ways you receive pills or shots include:</text><detail>On a regular schedule, where you do not need to ask for them</detail><detail>Only when you ask your nurse for them</detail><detail>Only at certain times, such as when you get up out of bed to walk in the hallway or go to physical therapy </detail><text>Most pills or shots provide relief for 4 to 6 hours or longer.

<item><title>Portion size</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000337.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>It can be hard to measure out every portion of food you eat. Yet there are some simple ways to know that you are eating the right serving sizes.</text><text>A recommended serving size is the amount of each food that you are supposed to eat during a meal or snack. A portion is the amount of food that you actually eat. If you eat more or less than the recommended serving size, you may get either too much or too little of the nutrients you need. </text><text>People with diabetes who use the exchange list for carb counting, should keep in mind that a "serving" on the exchange list will not always be the same as the recommended serving size. </text><text>For foods like cereal and pasta, it may be helpful to use measuring cups to measure out an exact serving for a couple of days until you get more practiced at eyeballing the appropriate portion.</text><text>Use your hand and other everyday objects to measure portion sizes:</text><detail>One serving of meat or poultry is the palm of your hand or a deck of cards</detail><detail>One 3-ounce (84 grams) serving of fish is a checkbook</detail><detail>One-half cup (40 grams) of ice cream is a tennis ball</detail><detail>One serving of cheese is six dice</detail><detail>One-half cup (80 grams) of cooked rice, pasta, or snacks such as chips or pretzels is a rounded handful, or a tennis ball</detail><detail>One serving of a pancake or waffle is a compact disc</detail><detail>Two tablespoons (36 grams) of peanut butter is a ping-pong ball </detail><text>You should eat five or more servings of fruits and vegetables each day to help reduce your risk of cancer and other diseases. Fruits and vegetables are low in fat and high in fiber. They will also help you fill up so that you are satisfied at the end of your meals They do contain calories so you should not eat an unlimited amount, especially of fruits.</text><text>How to measure out the correct serving sizes of fruits and vegetables:</text><detail>One cup (90 grams) of chopped raw fruits or vegetables is a woman's fist or a baseball</detail><detail>One medium apple or orange is a tennis ball</detail><detail>One-quarter cup (35 grams) of dried fruit or nuts is a golf ball or small handful</detail><detail>One cup (30 grams) of lettuce is four leaves (Romaine lettuce)</detail><detail>One medium baked potato is a computer mouse </detail><text>To control your portion sizes when you are eating at home, try the following tips:</text><detail>DO NOT eat from the bag. You could be tempted to eat too much. Use the serving size on the package to portion out the snack into small bags or bowls. You can also buy single-serving portions of your favorite snack foods. If you buy in bulk, you can divide snacks up into single-serving portions when you get home from the store.</detail><detail>Serve food on smaller plates. Eat from a salad plate instead of a dinner plate. Keep serving dishes on the kitchen counter so you will have to get up for seconds. Putting your food out of easy reach and out of sight will make it harder for you to overeat.</detail><detail>Half of your plate should contain green vegetables. Divide the other half between lean protein and whole grains. Filling half of your plate with green vegetables before you serve the rest of your entrée is one of the easiest methods of portion control.</detail><detail>Substitute lower-fat varieties of food. Instead of whole-fat cream cheese, sour cream, and milk, buy low-fat or skim instead. Use half the amount you would normally use of to save even more calories. You can try replacing half of the cream cheese with hummus or mix the sour cream with plain yogurt to make this easier</detail><detail>DO NOT eat mindlessly. When you snack in front of the television or while doing other activities, you will be distracted enough that you may eat too much. Eat at the table. Focus your attention on your food so you will know when you have had enough to eat.</detail><detail>Snack between meals if desired. If you are hungry between meals, eat a healthy, high-fiber snack such as a piece of fruit, small salad, or bowl of broth-based soup. The snack will fill you up so that you do not eat too much at your next meal. Snacks that pair protein and carbohydrates with fiber will leave you more satisfied. Some examples are having an apple with string cheese, whole-wheat crackers with peanut butter, or baby carrots with hummus. </detail><text>To control your portion sizes when eating out, try these tips:</text><detail>Order the small size. Instead of a medium or large, ask for the smallest size. By eating a small hamburger instead of a large, you will save about 150 calories. A small order of fries will save you about 300 calories, and a small soda will save 150 calories. Never super-size your order.</detail><detail>Order the "lunch size" of a food, rather than the dinner size.</detail><detail>Order appetizers rather than entrees.</detail><detail>Share your meal. Split an entree with a friend, or cut your meal in half when it arrives. Put one half in a to-go box before you start eating. You can have the rest of your meal for lunch the next day.</detail><detail>Fill up with lower calorie foods. Order a small salad, fruit cup, or cup of broth-based soup before your entree. It will fill you up so that you eat less of your meal. </detail></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>Obesity - portion size; Overweight - portion size; Weight-loss - portion size; Healthy diet - portion size</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 8/14/2016"><text>Updated by: Emily Wax, RD, The Brooklyn Hospital Center, Brooklyn, NY.

<item><title>Placenta abruptio</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000605.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>The placenta connects the fetus (unborn baby) to the mother's uterus. It allows the baby to get nutrients, blood, and oxygen from the mother. It also helps the baby get rid of waste.</text><text>Placenta abruptio (also called placental abruption) is when the placenta separates from the inner wall of the uterus before the baby is born. </text></h2><h2 title="More About This Condition"><text>In most pregnancies, the placenta stays attached to the upper part of the uterine wall.</text><text>In a small number of pregnancies, the placenta detaches (pulls itself from the wall of the uterus) too early. Most of the time, only part of the placenta pulls away. Other times it pulls away completely. If this happens, it is most often in the 3rd trimester.</text><text>The placenta is the lifeline of a fetus. Serious problems occur if it detaches. The baby gets less oxygen and fewer nutrients. Some babies become growth restricted (very small), and in a small number of cases, it is fatal. It can also cause significant blood loss for the mother.</text></h2><h2 title="What Causes It?"><text>No one knows what causes placental abruption. But these factors raise a woman's risk for it:</text><detail>Long-term (chronic) high blood pressure</detail><detail>Sudden high blood pressure in pregnant women who had normal blood pressure in the past</detail><detail>Heart disease</detail><detail>Diabetes</detail><detail>Smoking</detail><detail>Alcohol or cocaine use</detail><detail>Placental abruption in an earlier pregnancy</detail><detail>An injury to the mother (such as a car crash or fall in which the abdomen was hit)</detail><detail>Being African American</detail><detail>Being older than 40 </detail></h2><h2 title="Signs of Placental Abruption"><text>

 
The most common symptoms are vaginal bleeding and painful contractions. The amount of bleeding depends on how much of the placenta has detached. Sometimes the blood that collects when the placenta detaches stays between the placenta and uterine wall, so you may not have bleeding from your vagina.</text><detail>If the separation is slight, you may have only light bleeding. You may also have cramps or feel tender in your belly.</detail><detail>If the separation is moderate, you may have heavier bleeding. Cramps and belly pain will be more severe.</detail><detail>If more than half the placenta detaches, you may have belly pain and heavy bleeding. You may also have contractions. The baby may move more or less than normal.</detail><text>If you have any of these symptoms during your pregnancy, tell your health care provider right away.
</text></h2><h2 title="How is Placental Abruption Treated?"><text>Your provider will:</text><detail>Do a physical exam</detail><detail>Observe your contractions and how your baby responds to them</detail><detail>Sometimes do an ultrasound to check your placenta (but ultrasound does not always show a placental abruption)</detail><detail>Check your baby's heart rate and rhythm</detail><text>If your placental abruption is small, your provider may put you on bed rest to stop your bleeding. After a few days, most women can go back to their normal activities in most cases.</text><text>For a moderate separation, you will likely need to stay in the hospital. In the hospital:</text><detail>Your baby's heart rate will be monitored.</detail><detail>You might need a blood transfusion.</detail><detail>If your baby shows any signs of distress, your provider may induce your labor early. If you cannot give birth vaginally, you will need a C-section. </detail><text>Severe placental abruption is an emergency. You will need to deliver right away, most often by C-section. It is very rare, but a baby can be stillborn if there is a severe abruption.</text></h2><h2 title="Can I Prevent Placental Abruption?"><text>You cannot prevent placental abruption, but you can control the risk factors related to it by:</text><detail>Keeping high blood pressure, heart disease, and diabetes under control</detail><detail>Not using tobacco, alcohol, cocaine, or amphetamines</detail><detail>Following your provider's recommendations about ways to lower your risk if you had an abruption in a past pregnancy </detail></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>Premature placental separation; Placental separation; Placental abruption; Vaginal bleeding - abruption; Pregnancy - abruption</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 11/11/2016"><text>Updated by: Irina Burd, MD, PhD, Associate Professor of Gynecology and Obstetrics at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD.

<item><title>Piriformis syndrome</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000776.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>Piriformis syndrome is pain and numbness in your buttocks and down the back of your leg. It occurs when the piriformis muscle in the buttocks presses on the sciatic nerve. </text><text>The syndrome, which affects more women than men, is uncommon. But when it occurs, it can cause sciatica. </text></h2><h2 title="Causes"><text>The piriformis muscle is involved in nearly every movement you make with your lower body, from walking to shifting weight from one foot to the other. Beneath the muscle is the sciatic nerve. This nerve runs from your lower spine down the back of your leg to your foot.</text><text>Injuring or irritating the piriformis muscle can cause muscle spasms.The muscle may also swell or tighten from the spasms. This puts pressure on the nerve beneath it, causing pain.</text><text>Overuse can irritate or injure the muscle. Muscle spasms may come from:</text><detail>Sitting for long periods</detail><detail>Over exercising</detail><detail>Running, walking, or doing other repetitive activities</detail><detail>Playing sports</detail><detail>Climbing stairs</detail><detail>Lifting heavy objects </detail><text>Trauma can also cause muscle irritation and damage. This may be caused by:</text><detail>Car accidents</detail><detail>Falls</detail><detail>Sudden twisting of the hip</detail><detail>Penetrating wounds </detail></h2><h2 title="Symptoms"><text>Sciatica is the main symptom of piriformis syndrome. Other symptoms include:</text><detail>Tenderness or a dull ache in the buttock</detail><detail>Tingling or numbness in the buttock and along the back of the leg</detail><detail>Difficulty sitting</detail><detail>Pain from sitting that grows worse as you continue to sit</detail><detail>Pain that gets worse with activity</detail><detail>Lower body pain that is so severe it becomes disabling </detail><text>The pain usually affects just one side of the lower body. But it can also occur on both sides at the same time.</text></h2><h2 title="Exams and Tests"><text>Your health care provider will:</text><detail>Do a physical exam</detail><detail>Ask about your symptoms and recent activities</detail><detail>Take your medical history </detail><text>During the exam, your provider may put you through a range of movements. The point is to see if and where they cause pain.</text><text>Other problems can cause sciatica. For instance, a slipped disk or arthritis of the spine can put pressure on the sciatic nerve. To rule out other possible causes, you may have an MRI or a CT scan. </text></h2><h2 title="Treatment"><text>In some cases, you may not need medical treatment. The following self-care tips can help relieve pain.</text><detail>Avoid activities that cause pain, such as biking or running. You can resume these activities after the pain is gone.</detail><detail>Be sure to use proper form and equipment when doing sports or other physical activities.</detail><detail>Use pain medicines such as ibuprofen (Motrin, Advil), naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn), or acetaminophen (Tylenol) for pain.</detail><detail>Try ice and heat. Use an ice pack for 15 to 20 minutes every few hours. Wrap the ice pack in a towel to protect your skin. Alternate the cold pack with a heating pad on low setting. Don't use a heating pad for longer than 20 minutes at a time.</detail><detail>Follow your provider's instructions for doing special stretches. Stretches and exercises can relax and strengthen the piriformis muscle.</detail><detail>Use proper posture when sitting, standing, or driving. Sit up straight and don't slump. </detail><text>Your provider may prescribe muscle relaxants. This will relax the muscle so you can exercise and stretch it. Injections of steroid medicines into the area may also help.</text><text>For more severe pain, your provider may recommend electrotherapy such as TENS. This treatment uses electrical stimulation to reduce pain and stop muscle spasms.</text><text>As a last resort, your provider may recommend surgery to cut the muscle and relieve pressure on the nerve.</text></h2><h2 title="Prevention"><text>To prevent future pain:</text><detail>Get regular exercise.</detail><detail>Avoid running or exercising on hills or uneven surfaces.</detail><detail>Warm up and stretch before exercising. Then gradually increase the intensity of your activity.</detail><detail>If something causes you pain, stop doing it. Don't push through the pain. Rest until the pain passes.</detail><detail>Don't sit or lie down for long periods in positions that put extra pressure on your hips. </detail></h2><h2 title="When to Call the Doctor "><text>Call your provider if you have:</text><detail>Pain that lasts longer than a few weeks</detail><detail>Pain that starts after you have been injured in an accident </detail><text>Get medical help immediately if:</text><detail>You have sudden severe pain in your lower back or legs, along with muscle weakness or numbness</detail><detail>You have difficulty controlling your foot and find yourself tripping over it when you walk</detail><detail>You can't control your bowels or bladder </detail></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>Pseudosciatica; Wallet sciatica; Hip socket neuropathy; Pelvic outlet syndrome; Low back pain - piriformis</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 11/27/2016"><text>Updated by: C.

Start at the pin site and clean your skin by moving the swab away from the pin. Move the swab in a circle around the pin, then make the circles around the pin larger as you move away from the pin site.</detail><detail>Remove any dried drainage and debris from your skin with the swab.</detail><detail>Use a new swab or gauze to clean the pin. Start at the pin site and move up the pin, away from your skin.</detail><detail>When you are done cleaning, use a dry swab or gauze in the same way to dry the area. </detail><text>For a few days after your surgery you may wrap your pin site in dry sterile gauze while it heals. After this time, leave the pin site open to air.</text><text>If you have an external fixator (a steel bar that may be used for fractures of long bones), clean it with gauze and cotton swabs dipped in your cleaning solution every day.</text><text>Most people who have pins can take a shower 10 days after surgery.

Then, the doctor directs light at the cancer cells using a laser or other light source. The light triggers the medicine to produce a type of oxygen that treats cancer by:</text><detail>Killing cancer cells</detail><detail>Damaging blood cells in the tumor</detail><detail>Helping the body's infection-fighting system attack the tumor </detail><text>The light can come from a laser or other source. The light is often applied through a thin, lighted tube that is put inside the body. Small fibers at the end of the tube direct the light at the cancer cells. PDT treats cancer in the:</text><detail>Lungs, using a bronchoscope</detail><detail>Esophagus, using upper endoscopy</detail><text>Doctors use light-emitting diodes (LEDs) to treat skin cancers. Medicine is placed on the skin, and the light is shone on the skin.</text><text>Another type of PDT uses a machine to collect a person's blood, which is then treated with a drug and exposed to light. Then, the blood is returned to the person. This is used to treat symptoms of a certain type of lymphoma.</text></h2><h2 title="Pros and Cons of PDT"><text>PDT has several benefits. For example, it:</text><detail>Targets only cancer cells, not normal cells</detail><detail>Can be repeated many times in the same area, unlike radiation therapy</detail><detail>Is less risky than surgery</detail><detail>Takes less time and costs less than many other cancer treatments </detail><text>But PDT also has drawbacks. It can only treat areas where light can reach. That means it can only be used to treat cancer on or just under the skin, or in the linings of some organs. Also, it cannot be used in people with certain blood diseases.</text></h2><h2 title="Side Effects of PDT"><text>There are two main side effects of PDT. One is a reaction caused by light that makes the skin swollen, sunburned, or blistered after just a few minutes in the sun or near bright lights. This reaction can last as long as 3 months after treatment. To avoid it:</text><detail>Close the shades and curtains on windows and skylights in your home before you get your treatment.</detail><detail>Bring dark sunglasses, gloves, a wide-brimmed hat, and wear clothes that cover as much of your skin as possible to your treatment.</detail><detail>For at least a month after treatment, stay inside as much as possible, especially between 10 am and 4 pm.</detail><detail>Cover your skin whenever you go outside, even on cloudy days and in the car. DO NOT count on sunscreen, it will not prevent the reaction.</detail><detail>DO NOT use reading lamps and avoid exam lamps, such as the type a dentist uses.</detail><detail>DO NOT use helmet-type hair dryers like those in hair salons. Use only the low heat setting when using a hand-held hair dryer. </detail><text>The other main side effect is swelling, which may cause pain or trouble breathing or swallowing. These depend on the area that is treated. The side effects are temporary.</text></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>Phototherapy; Photochemotherapy; Photoradiation therapy; Cancer of the esophagus - photodynamic; Esophageal cancer - photodynamic; Lung cancer - photodynamic</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 10/21/2017"><text>Updated by: Todd Gersten, MD, Hematology/Oncology, Florida Cancer Specialists &amp;amp; Research Institute, Wellington, FL.

<item><title>Peripherally inserted central catheter - insertion</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000461.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>A peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) is a long, thin tube that goes into your body through a vein in your upper arm. The end of this catheter goes into a large vein near your heart. Your health care provider has determined that you need a PICC. The information below tells you what to expect when the PICC is inserted.</text></h2><h2 title="What is a Peripherally Inserted Central Catheter (PICC)?"><text>The PICC helps carry nutrients and medicines into your body. It is also used to draw blood when you need to have blood tests.</text><text>A PICC is used when you need intravenous (IV) medical treatment over a long period of time or if blood draws done the regular way have become difficult.</text></h2><h2 title="How is a PICC Inserted?"><text>The PICC insertion procedure is done in the radiology (x-ray) department or at your hospital bedside. The steps to insert it are:</text><detail>You lie on your back.</detail><detail>A tourniquet (strap) is tied around your arm near your shoulder.</detail><detail>Ultrasound pictures are used to choose the vein and guide the needle into your vein. Ultrasound looks inside your body with a device that is moved over your skin. It is painless.</detail><detail>The area where the needle is inserted is cleaned.</detail><detail>You get a shot of medicine to numb your skin. This may sting for a moment.</detail><detail>A needle is inserted, then a guide wire and the catheter. The guide wire and catheter are moved through your vein to the proper spot.</detail><detail>During this process, the needle puncture site is made a little larger with a scalpel. One or two stitches close it up afterward. This usually does not hurt. </detail><text>The catheter that was inserted is connected to another catheter that stays outside your body. You will receive medicines and other fluids through this catheter.</text></h2><h2 title="After the Catheter is Placed"><text>It is normal to have a little pain or swelling around the site for 2 or 3 weeks after the catheter is put in place. Take it easy. DO NOT lift anything with that arm or do strenuous activity for about 2 weeks.</text><text>Take your temperature at the same time each day and write it down. Call your provider if you develop a fever.</text><text>It is usually OK to take showers and baths several days after your catheter is placed. Ask your provider how long to wait. When you do shower or bathe, make sure the dressings are secure and your catheter site stays dry. DO NOT let the catheter site go under water if you are soaking in a bathtub.</text></h2><h2 title="Other Care"><text>Your nurse will teach you how to take care of your catheter in order to keep it working correctly and to help protect yourself from infection. This includes flushing the catheter, changing the dressing, and giving yourself medicines.</text><text>After some practice, taking care of your catheter gets easier. It is best to have a friend, family member, caregiver, or nurse help you.</text><text>Your doctor will give you a prescription for the supplies you need. You can buy these at a medical supply store. It will help to know the name of your catheter and what company makes it. Write this information down and keep it handy.</text></h2><h2 title="When to Contact a Medical Professional"><text>Call your provider if you have:</text><detail>Bleeding, redness, or swelling at the catheter site</detail><detail>Dizziness</detail><detail>Fever or chills</detail><detail>Hard time breathing</detail><detail>Leaking from the catheter, or the catheter is cut or cracked</detail><detail>Pain or swelling near the catheter site, or in your neck, face, chest, or arm</detail><detail>Trouble flushing your catheter or changing your dressing</detail><text>Also call your provider if your catheter:</text><detail>Is coming out of your vein</detail><detail>Seems blocked</detail></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>PICC - insertion</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 11/20/2017"><text>Updated by: Laura J.

<item><title>Peripheral artery bypass - leg - discharge </title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000239.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>Peripheral artery bypass surgery is done to re-route the blood supply around a blocked artery in the leg. You had this surgery because fatty deposits in your arteries were blocking blood flow. This caused symptoms of pain and heaviness in your leg that made walking difficult. This article tells you how to take care of yourself after leaving the hospital.</text></h2><h2 title="When You’re in the Hospital"><text>You had peripheral artery bypass surgery to re-route the blood supply around a blocked artery in one of your legs. </text><text>Your surgeon made an incision (cut) over the area where the artery was blocked. This may have been in your leg or groin, or the lower part of your belly. Clamps were placed over the artery at each end of the blocked section. A special tube called a graft was sewn into the artery to replace the blocked part. </text><text>You may have stayed in the intensive care unit (ICU) for 1 to 3 days after surgery. After that, you stayed in a regular hospital room.</text></h2><h2 title="What to Expect at Home"><text>Your incision may be sore for several days. You should be able to walk farther now without needing to rest. Full recovery from surgery may take 6 to 8 weeks.</text></h2><h2 title="Activity "><text>Walk short distances 3 to 4 times a day. Slowly increase how far you walk each time.</text><text>When you are resting, keep your leg raised above the level of your heart to prevent leg swelling:</text><detail>Lie down and place a pillow under the lower part of your leg.</detail><detail>DO NOT sit for more than 1 hour at a time when you first come home. If you can, raise your feet and legs when you are sitting. Rest them on another chair or a stool. </detail><text>You will have more leg swelling after walking or sitting. If you have a lot of swelling, you may be doing too much walking or sitting, or eating too much salt in your diet.</text><text>When you climb stairs, use your good leg first when you go up. Use your leg that had surgery first when you go down. Rest after taking several steps.</text><text>Your health care provider will tell you when you can drive. You may take short trips as a passenger, but try to sit in the backseat with your leg that had surgery raised up on the seat.</text></h2><h2 title="Wound Care"><text>If your staples have been removed, you will probably have Steri-Strips (small pieces of tape) across your incision.

<item><title>Percutaneous urinary procedures - discharge</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000137.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>You had a procedure to drain urine from your kidney or to get rid of kidney stones. This article gives you advice on what to expect after the procedure and steps you should take to care for yourself.</text></h2><h2 title="When You're in the Hospital"><text>You had percutaneous (through the skin) urinary procedures to help drain urine from your kidney and get rid of kidney stones.</text><text>If you had a percutaneous nephrostomy, the health care provider inserted a small, flexible catheter (tube) through your skin into your kidney to drain your urine.</text><text>If you also had percutaneous nephrostolithotomy (or nephrolithotomy), the provider passed a small medical instrument through your skin into your kidney. This was done to break up or remove kidney stones.</text></h2><h2 title="What to Expect at Home"><text>You may have some pain in your back for the first week after the catheter was inserted into the kidney. Over-the-counter pain medicine such as Tylenol may help with the pain. Other pain medicines, such as aspirin or ibuprofen (Advil) can also help, but your provider may not recommend that you take these medicines because they can increase your risk of bleeding.</text><text>You may have some clear-to-light yellow drainage around the catheter insertion site for the first 1 to 3 days. This is normal.</text><text>A tube that comes from your kidney will pass through the skin on your back. This helps the urine flow from your kidney into a bag that is attached to your leg. You may see some blood in the bag at first. This is normal and should clear over time.</text></h2><h2 title="Caring for Your Tubes and Catheters"><text>Proper care of your nephrostomy catheter is important so you do not get an infection.</text><detail>During the day, you may use a small urinary bag that is attachesd to your leg.</detail><detail>Use a larger drainage bag at night.</detail><detail>Always keep the urinary bag below the level of your kidneys.</detail><detail>Empty the bag before it is completely full.</detail><detail>Wash your drainage bag once a week using a solution of half white vinegar and half water. Rinse it well with water and allow it to air dry. </detail><text>Drink plenty of liquids (2 to 3 liters) every day, unless your provider tells you not to do so.</text><text>Avoid any activity that causes a pulling sensation, pain around the catheter, or kinking in the catheter. DO NOT swim when you have this catheter.</text><text>Your provider will recommend that you take sponge baths so that your dressing stays dry. You may take a shower if you wrap the dressing with plastic wrap and replace the dressing if it gets damp. DO NOT soak in a bathtub or hot tub.</text></h2><h2 title="Dressing Changes"><text>Your provider will show you how to place a new dressing.</text><text>Change your dressing every 2 to 3 days for the first week. Change it more often if it gets dirty, wet, or becomes loose. After the first week, change your dressing once a week, or more often as needed.</text><text>You will need some supplies when you change your dressing. These include: Telfa (the dressing material), Tegaderm (the clear plastic tape that holds the plastic ring in place), scissors, split gauze sponges, 4-inch x 4-inch (10 cm x 10 cm) gauze sponges, tape, connecting tube, hydrogen peroxide, and warm water (plus a clean container to mix them in), and a drainage bag (if needed).</text><text>Always wash your hands well with soap and water before you remove the old dressing. Wash them again before you put on the new dressing.</text><text>Be careful when you take off the old dressing:</text><detail>DO NOT pull on the drainage catheter.</detail><detail>Keep the plastic ring against your skin.</detail><detail>Check to see that the sutures (stitches) or the device that holds your catheter against your skin is secure. </detail><text>When the old dressing is off, gently clean the skin around your catheter. Use a cotton swab soaked with a solution of half hydrogen peroxide and half warm water. Pat it dry with a clean cloth.</text><text>Look at the skin around your catheter for any increase in redness, tenderness, or drainage. Call your provider if you notice these changes.</text><text>Place a clean dressing the way your provider showed you.</text><text>If possible, have family or a friend change the dressing for you. This makes the process easier.</text></h2><h2 title="When to Call the Doctor"><text>Call your provider if you have any of these symptoms:</text><detail>Pain in your back or side that will not go away or is getting worse</detail><detail>Blood in your urine after the first few days</detail><detail>Fever and chills</detail><detail>Vomiting</detail><detail>Urine that smells bad or looks cloudy</detail><detail>Worsening redness or pain of the skin around the tube</detail><text>Also call if:</text><detail>The plastic ring is pulling away from your skin.</detail><detail>The catheter has pulled out.</detail><detail>The catheter stops draining urine into the bag.</detail><detail>The catheter is kinked.</detail><detail>Your skin under the tape is irritated.</detail><detail>Urine is leaking around the catheter or plastic ring.</detail><detail>You have redness, swelling, or pain where the catheter comes out of your skin.</detail><detail>There is more drainage than usual on your dressings.</detail><detail>The drainage is bloody or contains pus. </detail></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>Percutaneous nephrostomy - discharge; Percutaneous nephrostolithotomy - discharge; PCNL - discharge; Nephrolithotomy - discharge; Percutaneous lithotripsy - discharge; Endoscopic lithotripsy - discharge; Kidney stent - discharge; Uteric stent - discharge; Renal calculi - nephrostomy; Nephrolithiasis - nephrostomy; Stones and kidney - self-care; Calcium stones - nephrostomy; Oxalate stones - nephrostomy; Uric acid stones - nephrostomy</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 10/4/2016"><text>Updated by: Jennifer Sobol, DO, urologist with the Michigan Institute of Urology, West Bloomfield, MI.

<item><title>Peptic ulcer disease - discharge</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000380.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>A peptic ulcer is an open sore or raw area in the lining of the stomach (gastric ulcer) or upper part of the small intestine (duodenal ulcer). This article describes how to care for yourself after you have been treated by your health care provider for this condition.</text></h2><h2 title="What to Expect at Home"><text>You have peptic ulcer disease (PUD). You may have had tests to help diagnose your ulcer. One of these tests may have been to look for bacteria in your stomach called Helicobacter pylori (H pylori). This type of infection is a common cause of ulcers.</text><text>Most peptic ulcers will heal within about 4 to 6 weeks after treatment begins. DO NOT stop taking the medicines you have been prescribed, even if symptoms go away quickly.</text></h2><h2 title="Diet and Lifestyle"><text>People with PUD should eat a healthy balanced diet.</text><text>It does not help to eat more often or increase the amount of milk and dairy products you consume. These changes may even cause more stomach acid. </text><detail>Avoid foods and drinks that cause discomfort for you. For many people these include alcohol, coffee, caffeinated soda, fatty foods, chocolate, and spicy foods.</detail><detail>Avoid eating late night snacks. </detail><text>Other things you can do to ease your symptoms and help healing include:</text><detail>If you smoke or chew tobacco, try to quit. Tobacco will slow the healing of your ulcer and increase the chance that the ulcer will come back. Talk to your doctor about getting help for quitting tobacco use.</detail><detail>Try to reduce your stress level and learn ways to better manage stress. </detail><text>Avoid drugs such as aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), or naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn). Take acetaminophen (Tylenol) to relieve pain. Take all medicines with plenty of water.</text></h2><h2 title="Medicines"><text>The standard treatment for a peptic ulcer and an H pylori infection uses a combination of medicines that you take for 5 to 14 days.</text><detail>Most people will take two types of antibiotics and a proton pump inhibitor (PPI).</detail><detail>These medicines may cause nausea, diarrhea, and other side effects. DO NOT just stop taking them without talking to your provider first. </detail><text>If you have an ulcer without an H pylori infection, or one that is caused by taking aspirin or NSAIDs, you will likely need to take a proton pump inhibitor for 8 weeks.</text><text>Taking antacids as needed between meals, and then at bedtime, may help healing also. Ask your provider about taking these medicines.</text><text>Talk to your provider about your medicine choices if your ulcer was caused by aspirin, ibuprofen, or other NSAIDs. You may be able to take a different anti-inflammatory drug. Or, your provider may have you take a drug called misoprostol or a PPI to prevent future ulcers.</text></h2><h2 title="Follow-up"><text>You will have follow-up visits to see how your ulcer is healing especially if the ulcer was in the stomach.</text><text>Your provider may want to perform an upper endoscopy after treatment to make sure healing has taken place.</text><text>You will also need follow-up testing to check that the H pylori bacteria are gone. You should wait at least 2 weeks after therapy is completed to be retested. Test results before that time may not be accurate.</text></h2><h2 title="When to Call the Doctor"><text>Get medical help right away if you:</text><detail>Develop sudden, sharp abdominal pain</detail><detail>Have a rigid, hard abdomen that is tender to the touch</detail><detail>Have symptoms of shock, such as fainting, excessive sweating, or confusion</detail><detail>Vomit blood</detail><detail>See blood in your stool (maroon, dark, or tarry black stools) </detail><text>Call your provider if:</text><detail>You feel dizzy or light-headed</detail><detail>You have ulcer symptoms</detail><detail>You feel full after eating a small meal portion</detail><detail>You experience unintentional weight loss</detail><detail>You are vomiting</detail><detail>You lose your appetite </detail></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>Ulcer - peptic - discharge; Ulcer - duodenal - discharge; Ulcer - gastric - discharge; Duodenal ulcer - discharge; Gastric ulcer - discharge; Dyspepsia - ulcer - discharge</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 4/24/2017"><text>Updated by: Michael M.

<item><title>PEG tube insertion - discharge</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000900.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>A PEG (percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy) feeding tube insertion is the placement of a feeding tube through the skin and the stomach wall. It goes directly into the stomach. PEG feeding tube insertion is done in part using a procedure called endoscopy.</text><text>Feeding tubes are needed when you are unable to eat or drink. This may be due to stroke or other brain injury, problems with the esophagus, surgery of the head and neck, or other conditions.</text><text>Your PEG tube is easy to use. You (or your caregiver) can learn to care for it on your own and even give yourself tube feedings.</text></h2><h2 title="About PEG Tubes"><text>Here are the important parts of your PEG tube:</text><detail>PEG/Gastronomy feeding tube.</detail><detail>2 small discs that are on the outside and the inside of the gastrostomy opening (or stoma) in your stomach wall. These discs prevent the feeding tube from moving. The disc on the outside is very close to the skin.</detail><detail>A clamp to close off the feeding tube.</detail><detail>A device to attach or fix the tube to the skin when not feeding.</detail><detail>2 openings at the end of the tube. One is for the feedings or medicines, the other for flushing the tube. (There may be a third opening on some tubes. It is there when there is a balloon instead of an internal disc). </detail><text>After you have had your gastrostomy for a while and the stoma is established, something called a button device can be used. These make feedings and care easier.</text><text>The tube itself will have a mark that shows where it should be leaving the stoma. You can use this mark whenever you need to confirm the tube is in the correct position.</text></h2><h2 title="What you Will Need to Know"><text>Things you or your caregivers will need to learn include:</text><detail>Signs or symptoms of infection</detail><detail>Signs that the tube is blocked and what to do</detail><detail>What to do if the tube is pulled out</detail><detail>How to hide the tube under clothes</detail><detail>How to empty the stomach through the tube</detail><detail>What activities are ok to continue and what to avoid </detail><text>Feedings will start slowly with clear liquids, and increase slowly.

The skin should heal in 2 to 3 weeks.</text><text>You will need to clean the skin around the PEG-tube 1 to 3 times a day.</text><detail>Use either mild soap and water or sterile saline (ask you provider). You may use a cotton swab or gauze.</detail><detail>Try to remove any drainage or crusting on the skin and tube. Be gentle.</detail><detail>If you used soap, gently clean again with plain water.</detail><detail>Dry the skin well with a clean towel or gauze.</detail><detail>Take care not to pull on the tube itself to prevent it from being pulled out. </detail><text>For the first 1 to 2 weeks, you provider will likely ask you to use sterile technique when caring for your PEG-tube site.</text><text>Your health care provider may also want you to put a special absorbent pad or gauze around the PEG-tube site. This should be changed at least daily or if it becomes wet or soiled.</text><detail>Avoid bulky dressings.</detail><detail>DO NOT put the gauze under the disc. </detail><text>DO NOT use any ointments, powders, or sprays around the PEG-tube unless told to do so by your provider.</text><text>Ask your provider when it is ok to shower or bathe. </text></h2><h2 title="Keeping the PEG-tube in Place"><text>If the feeding tube comes out, the stoma or opening may begin to close. To prevent this problem, tape the tube to your abdomen or use the fixation device. A new tube should be placed right away. Call your provider for advice on next steps.</text><text>Your provider can train you or your caregiver to rotate the gastrostomy tube when you are cleaning. This prevents it from sticking to the side of stoma and opening leading to the stomach.</text><detail>Make note of the mark or guide number of where the tube exits the stoma.</detail><detail>Detach the tube from the fixation device.</detail><detail>Rotate the tube a bit. </detail></h2><h2 title="When to Call the Doctor"><text>You should call your provider if:</text><detail>The feeding tube has come out and you do not know how to replace it</detail><detail>There is leakage around the tube or system</detail><detail>There is redness or irritation on the skin area around the tube</detail><detail>The feeding tube seems blocked</detail><detail>There is a lot of bleeding from the tube insertion site </detail><text>Also call your provider if you:</text><detail>Have diarrhea after feedings</detail><detail>Have a hard and swollen belly 1 hour after feedings</detail><detail>Have worsening pain</detail><detail>Are on a new medicine</detail><detail>Are constipated and passing hard, dry stools</detail><detail>Are coughing more than normal or feel short of breath after feedings</detail><detail>Notice feeding solution in your mouth </detail></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>Gastrostomy tube insertion-discharge; G-tube insertion-discharge; PEG tube insertion-discharge; Stomach tube insertion-discharge; Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube insertion-discharge</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 8/1/2017"><text>Updated by: Subodh K.

<item><title>Pediatric heart surgery - discharge</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000015.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>Your child had surgery to repair a heart defect. If your child had open-heart surgery, a surgical cut was made through the breastbone or the side of the chest. The child also may have been put on a heart-lung bypass machine during surgery.</text><text>After the surgery, your child was probably in the intensive care unit (ICU) and then in another part of the hospital.</text></h2><h2 title="What to Expect at Home"><text>Your child will need at least 3 or 4 more weeks at home to recover. For larger surgeries, recovery may take 6 to 8 weeks. Talk with your child's health care provider about when your child can return to school, daycare, or take part in sports.</text><text>Pain after surgery is normal. There may be more pain after closed-heart surgery than after open-heart surgery. This is because nerves may have been irritated or cut. The pain will likely decrease after the second day and can sometimes be managed with acetaminophen (Tylenol).</text><text>Many children behave differently after heart surgery. They may be clingy, irritable, wet the bed, or cry. They may do these things even if they were not doing them before their surgery. Support your child through this time. Slowly begin to set the limits that were in place before the surgery.</text></h2><h2 title="Activity "><text>For an infant, keep the child from crying for too long for the first 3 to 4 weeks. You can calm your child by staying calm yourself. When lifting your child, support both the child's head and bottom for the first 4 to 6 weeks.</text><text>Toddlers and older children will often stop any activity if they become tired.</text><text>The provider will tell you when it is OK for your child to return to school or daycare.</text><detail>Most often, the first few weeks after surgery should be a time to rest.</detail><detail>After the first follow-up visit, the provider will tell you what your child can do.</detail><text>For the first 4 weeks after surgery, your child should not do any activity that could result in a fall or a blow to the chest. Your child should also avoid bicycle or skateboard riding, roller skating, swimming, and all contact sports until the provider says it is OK.</text><text>Children who have had an incision through the breastbone need to be careful about how they use their arms and upper bodies for the first 6 to 8 weeks.</text><detail>DO NOT pull or lift the child by the arms or from their armpit area. Scoop the child up instead.</detail><detail>Prevent your child from doing any activities that involve pulling or pushing with the arms.</detail><detail>Try to keep your child from lifting the arms above the head.</detail><detail>Your child should not lift anything heavier than 5 pounds (2 kg). </detail></h2><h2 title="Diet "><text>Keep a close eye on your child's diet to make sure they get enough calories to heal and grow.</text><text>After heart surgery, most babies and infants (younger than 12 to 15 months) can take as much formula or breast milk as they want. In some cases, the provider may want your baby to avoid drinking too much formula or breast milk. Limit feeding time to around 30 minutes. Your child's provider will tell you how to add extra calories to formula if it is necessary.</text><text>Toddlers and older children should be given a regular, healthy diet. The provider will tell you how to improve the child's diet after surgery.</text><text>Ask your child's provider if you have any questions about your child's nutrition.</text></h2><h2 title="Wound Care "><text>Your provider will instruct you on how to care for the incisions. Look at the wound for signs of infection, such as redness, swelling, tenderness, warmth, or drainage.</text><text>Your child should take only a shower or a sponge bath until your provider says otherwise. Steri-Strips should not be soaked in water. They will begin to peel off after the first week. It is OK to remove them when they start to peel off.</text><text>For as long as the scar looks pink, make sure it is covered with clothing or a bandage when your child is in the sun.</text></h2><h2 title="Follow-up"><text>Ask your child's provider before getting any immunizations for 2 to 3 months after surgery. Afterward, your child should have a flu shot every year.</text><text>Many children who have had heart surgery must take antibiotics before, and sometimes after, having any dental work. Make sure you have clear instructions from your child's heart provider about when your child needs antibiotics.

<item><title>Pectus excavatum - discharge</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000298.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>You or your child had surgery to correct pectus excavatum. This is an abnormal formation of the rib cage that gives the chest a caved-in or sunken appearance.</text><text>Follow your doctor's instructions on self-care at home.</text></h2><h2 title="When You or Your Child Was in the Hospital"><text>The surgery was done either as an open or closed procedure. With open surgery a single cut (incision) was made across the front part of the chest. With a closed procedure, two small incisions were made, one on each side of the chest. Surgical tools were inserted through the incisions to perform the surgery.</text><text>During surgery, either a metal bar or struts were placed in the chest cavity to hold the breastbone in the correct position. The metal bar will stay in place for about 1 to 3 years. The struts will be removed in 6 to 12 months.</text></h2><h2 title="Home Care"><text>You or your child should walk often during the day to build up strength. You may need to help your child get in and out of bed during the first 1 to 2 weeks after surgery.</text><text>During the first month at home, be sure you or your child:</text><detail>Always bend over at the hips.</detail><detail>Sit up straight to help keep the bar in place. DO NOT slouch.</detail><detail>DO NOT roll onto either side. </detail><text>It may be more comfortable for you or your child to sleep partly sitting up in a recliner for the first 2 to 4 weeks after surgery.</text><text>You or your child should not use a backpack. Ask your surgeon how much weight is safe for you or your child to lift or carry. The surgeon may tell you that it should not be heavier than 5 or 10 pounds (2 to 4.5 kilograms).</text><text>You or your child should avoid vigorous activity and contact sports for 3 months. After that, activity is good because it improves growth of the chest and strengthens the chest muscles. </text><text>Ask the surgeon when you or your child can return to work or school.</text><text>Most dressings (bandages) will be removed by the time you or your child leaves the hospital. There may still be strips of tape on the incisions. Leave these in place. They will fall off on their own. There may be a small amount of drainage on the strips. This is normal.</text><text>Keep all follow-up appointments with the surgeon. This will likely be 2 weeks after surgery. Other doctor visits will be needed while the metal bar or strut is still in place. Another surgery will be done to remove the bar or struts. This is usually done on an outpatient basis.</text><text>You or your child should wear a medical alert bracelet or necklace while the metal bar or strut is in place. The surgeon can give you more information about this.</text></h2><h2 title="When to Call the Doctor"><text>Call the surgeon if you or your child has any of the following:</text><detail>Fever of 101°F (38.3°C), or higher</detail><detail>Increased swelling, pain, drainage, or bleeding from the wounds</detail><detail>Severe chest pain</detail><detail>Shortness of breath</detail><detail>Nausea or vomiting</detail><detail>Change in the way the chest looks since the surgery </detail></h2><h2 title="Review Date 1/31/2017"><text>Updated by: Mary C.

What helps when you feel fear or anxiety? Were you able to do something about it? For example, if the fear or anxiety started with a pain, did taking pain medicine help? </text><text>Use the energy of the feeling to do something, such as:</text><detail>Write down what you are feeling and thinking.</detail><detail>Exercise.</detail><detail>Talk to someone. </detail><text>To help you relax:</text><detail>Breathe slowly and deeply for a few minutes.</detail><detail>Listen to music that calms you.</detail><detail>Slowly count backward from 100 to 0.</detail><detail>Do yoga, qigong, or tai chi.</detail><detail>Have someone massage your hands, feet, arms, or back.</detail><detail>Pet a cat or dog.</detail><detail>Ask someone to read to you. </detail><text>To prevent feeling anxious:</text><detail>When you need to rest, tell visitors to come another time.</detail><detail>Take your medicine as it was prescribed.</detail><detail>DO NOT drink alcohol.</detail><detail>DO NOT have drinks with caffeine. </detail><text>Many people find they can prevent or manage these feelings if they can talk to someone they trust.</text><detail>Talk to a friend or loved one who is willing to listen.</detail><detail>When you see your doctor or nurse, talk about your fears.</detail><detail>If you have worries about money or other issues, or just want to talk about your feelings, ask to see a social worker. </detail><text>Your health care provider can give you medicine to help with these feelings.

<item><title>Pain and your emotions</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000417.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>Chronic pain can limit your everyday activities and make it hard to work. It can also affect how involved you are with friends and family members. Co-workers, family, and friends may have to do more than their usual share when you cannot do the things you normally do.</text><text>Unwanted feelings, such as frustration, resentment, and stress, are often a result. These feelings and emotions can worsen your back pain.</text></h2><h2 title="Mind-body Relationship"><text>The mind and body work together, they cannot be separated. The way your mind controls thoughts and attitudes affects the way your body controls pain.</text><text>Pain itself, and the fear of pain, can cause you to avoid both physical and social activities. Over times this leads to less physical strength and weaker social relationships. It can also cause further lack of functioning and pain.</text></h2><h2 title="Stress"><text>Stress has both physical and emotional effects on our bodies. It can raise our blood pressure, increase our breathing rate and heart rate, and cause muscle tension. These things are hard on the body. They can lead to fatigue, sleeping problems, and changes in appetite.</text><text>If you feel tired but have a hard time falling asleep, you may have stress-related fatigue. Or you may notice that you can fall asleep, but you have a hard time staying asleep. These are all reasons to talk with your doctor about the physical effects stress is having on your body.</text><text>Stress can also lead to anxiety, depression, a dependence on others, or an unhealthy dependence on medicines.</text></h2><h2 title="Depression "><text>Depression is very common among people who have chronic pain. Pain can cause depression or make existing depression worse. Depression can also make existing pains worse.</text><text>If you or your family members have or have had depression, there is a greater risk that you could develop depression from your chronic pain. Seek help at the first sign of depression. Even mild depression can affect how well you can manage your pain and stay active.</text><text>Signs of depression include:</text><detail>Frequent feelings of sadness, anger, worthlessness, or hopelessness</detail><detail>Less energy</detail><detail>Less interest in activities, or less pleasure from your activities</detail><detail>Difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep</detail><detail>Decreased or increased appetite that causes major weight loss or weight gain</detail><detail>Difficulty concentrating</detail><detail>Thoughts about death, suicide, or hurting yourself </detail></h2><h2 title="What to do About Your Emotions"><text>A common type of therapy for people with chronic pain is cognitive behavioral therapy. Seeking help from a therapist can help you:</text><detail>Learn how to have positive thoughts instead of negative ones</detail><detail>Reduce your fear of pain</detail><detail>Make important relationships stronger</detail><detail>Develop a sense of freedom from your pain </detail><text>If your pain is the result of an accident or emotional trauma, your health care provider can assess you for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Many people with PTSD are not able to deal with their back pain until they deal with the emotional stress that their accidents or traumas caused.</text><text>If you think you may be depressed, or if you are having a hard time controlling your emotions, talk with your provider. Get help sooner rather than later. Your provider may also suggest medicines to help with your feelings of stress or sadness.</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 9/7/2017"><text>Updated by: C.

<item><title>Rotator cuff - self-care</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000358.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>The rotator cuff is a group of muscles and tendons that attach to the bones of the shoulder joint, allowing the shoulder to move and remain stable. The tendons can be torn from overuse or injury.</text><text>Pain relief measures, using the shoulder properly, and shoulder exercises may help ease your symptoms.</text></h2><h2 title="Rotator Cuff Problems"><text>Common rotator cuff problems include:</text><detail>Tendinitis, which is irritation of the tendons and inflammation of the bursa (a normally smooth layer) lining these tendons</detail><detail>A tear, which occurs when one of the tendons is torn from overuse or injury </detail></h2><h2 title="Relieving the Pain"><text>Medicines, such as ibuprofen or naproxen, may help reduce swelling and pain. If you take these medicines every day, tell your doctor so that your general health can be monitored.</text><text>Moist heat, such as a hot bath, shower, or a heat pack, can help when you feel pain in your shoulder. An ice pack applied to the shoulder 20 minutes at a time, 3 to 4 times a day, may also help when you are in pain.</text></h2><h2 title="Using Your Shoulder"><text>Learn how to care for your shoulder to avoid placing extra stress on it. This can help you heal from an injury and avoid re-injury.</text><text>Your positions and posture during the day and night can also help relieve some of your shoulder pain:</text><detail>When you sleep, lie either on the side that is not in pain or on your back. Resting your painful shoulder on a couple of pillows may help.</detail><detail>When sitting, use good posture. Keep your head over your shoulder and place a towel or pillow behind your lower back. Keep your feet either flat on the floor or up on a foot stool.</detail><detail>Practice good posture in general to keep your shoulder blade and joint in their right positions. </detail><text>Other tips for taking care of your shoulder include:</text><detail>DO NOT carry a backpack or purse over just one shoulder.</detail><detail>DO NOT work with your arms above shoulder level for very long. If needed, use a foot stool or ladder.</detail><detail>Lift and carry objects close to your body. Try not to lift heavy loads away from your body or overhead.</detail><detail>Take regular breaks from any activity you do over and over again.</detail><detail>When reaching for something with your arm, your thumb should be pointing up.</detail><detail>Store items you use every day in places you can reach easily.</detail><detail>Keep things that you use a lot, such as your phone, with you or close by to avoid reaching and re-injuring your shoulder. </detail></h2><h2 title="Physical Therapy and Exercises"><text>Your doctor will likely refer you to a physical therapist to learn exercises for your shoulder.</text><detail>You may start with passive exercises. These are exercises the therapist will do with your arm. They help get the full movement back in your shoulder.</detail><detail>After that, you will do exercises the therapist teaches you to strengthen your shoulder muscles. </detail></h2><h2 title="Returning to Sports"><text>It is best to avoid playing sports until you have no pain during rest or activity. Also, when examined by your doctor or physical therapist, you should have:</text><detail>Full strength in the muscles around your shoulder joint</detail><detail>Good range of motion of your shoulder blade and upper spine</detail><detail>No pain during certain physical exam tests that are meant to provoke pain in someone who has rotator cuff problems</detail><detail>No abnormal movement of your shoulder joint and shoulder blade </detail><text>Returning to sports and other activity should be gradual.

Most American high school seniors have had an alcoholic drink within the past month. Drinking can lead to risky and dangerous behaviors.</text></h2><h2 title="Alcohol Use and Teenagers "><text>Puberty and the teenage years are a time of change. Your child may have just started high school or just gotten a driver's license. They may have a sense of freedom they never had before. </text><text>Teenagers are curious. They want to explore and do things their own way. But pressure to fit in might make it hard to resist alcohol if it seems like everyone else is trying it. </text></h2><h2 title="The Best Time to Begin Talking"><text>When a child begins drinking before age 15, they are much more likely to become a long-term drinker, or problem drinker. About 1 in 5 teens are considered problem drinkers. This means they:</text><detail>Get drunk</detail><detail>Have accidents related to drinking</detail><detail>Get into trouble with the law, their families, friends, schools, or the people they date </detail><text>The best time to begin talking with your teen about drugs and alcohol is now. Children as young as 9 years old may become curious about drinking and they may even try alcohol.</text></h2><h2 title="Alcohol can Cause Injury or Death"><text>Drinking can lead to making decisions that cause harm. Alcohol use means any of the following are more likely to occur: </text><detail>Car crashes</detail><detail>Falls, drowning, and other accidents</detail><detail>Suicide</detail><detail>Violence and homicide</detail><detail>Being a victim of violent crime </detail></h2><h2 title="Risky Sexual Behavior"><text>Alcohol use can lead to risky sexual behavior. This increases the risk for:</text><detail>Sexually transmitted infections</detail><detail>Unwanted pregnancy</detail><detail>Sexual assault or rape </detail></h2><h2 title="Drinking and School"><text>Over time, too much alcohol damages brain cells. This can lead to behavior problems and lasting damage to memory, thinking, and judgment. Teens who drink tend to do poorly in school and their behaviors may get them into trouble.</text></h2><h2 title="Health Problems Related to Alcohol"><text>The effects of long-term alcohol use on the brain may be lifelong. Drinking also creates a higher risk for depression, anxiety, and low self-esteem.</text><text>Drinking during puberty can also change hormones in the body. This can disrupt growth and puberty.</text><text>Too much alcohol at one time can cause serious injury or death from alcohol poisoning. This can occur with having as few as 4 drinks within 2 hours.</text></h2><h2 title="Get Help for Your Child"><text>If you think your child is drinking but will not talk with you about it, get help. Your child's health care provider may be a good place to start. Other resources include: </text><detail>Local hospitals</detail><detail>Public or private mental health agencies</detail><detail>Counselors at your child's school</detail><detail>Student health centers</detail><detail>Programs such as Alateen, part of the Al-Anon program -- al-anon.org/for-members/group-resources/alateen</detail></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>Risky drinking - teen; Alcohol - underage drinking; Problem underage drinking; Underage drinking - risks</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 4/15/2018"><text>Updated by: Linda J.

Some of these include:</text><detail>Breathing problems after surgery. These are more common if you've had general anesthesia and a breathing tube.</detail><detail>Heart attack or stroke during or after surgery.</detail><detail>Infection in the joint, lungs (pneumonia), or urinary tract.</detail><detail>Poor wound healing. This is more likely for people who are not healthy before surgery, who smoke or have diabetes, or who take medicines that weaken their immune systems.</detail><detail>An allergic reaction to a medicine you receive. This is rare, but some of these reactions may be life threatening.</detail><detail>Falls in the hospital. Falls can be a major problem. Many things can lead to a fall, including loose gowns, slippery floors, medicines that make you sleepy, pain, unfamiliar surroundings, weakness after surgery, or moving around with a lot of tubes attached to your body. </detail></h2><h2 title="Bleeding"><text>It is normal to lose blood during and after hip or knee replacement surgery. Some people need a blood transfusion during surgery or during their recovery period in the hospital. You are less likely to need a transfusion if your red blood count is high enough before surgery. Some surgeries require you to donate blood before surgery. You should ask your provider about whether there is a need for that.</text><text>Much of the bleeding during surgery comes from the bone that has been cut. A bruise may occur if blood collects around the new joint or under the skin after surgery.</text></h2><h2 title="Blood Clots"><text>Your chances of having a blood clot form are higher during and soon after hip or knee replacement surgery. Sitting or lying down for long periods of time during and after surgery will make your blood move more slowly through your body. This increases your risk of a blood clot.</text><text>Two types of blood clots are:</text><detail>Deep vein thrombosis (DVT). These are blood clots that may form in your leg veins after surgery.</detail><detail>Pulmonary embolism. These are blood clots that may travel up to your lungs and cause serious breathing problems. </detail><text>To lower your risk of blood clots:</text><detail>You may receive blood thinners before and after surgery.</detail><detail>You might wear compression stockings on your legs to improve blood flow after surgery.</detail><detail>You will be encouraged to do exercises while in bed and get out of bed and walk in the halls to improve blood flow. </detail></h2><h2 title="Possible Problems With Your new Joint"><text>Some problems that may occur after hip or knee replacement surgery include:</text><detail>Infection in your new joint. If this occurs, your new joint may need to be removed to clear the infection. This problem is more likely in people who have diabetes or a weakened immune system. After surgery, and often before surgery, you will learn what you can do to prevent infections in your new joint.</detail><detail>Dislocation of your new joint. This is rare. It most often occurs if you return to activities before you are ready. This can cause sudden pain and inability to walk. You should call your provider if this happens. It is likely that you will need to go to the emergency room.</detail><detail>Loosening of your new joint over time. This can cause pain, and sometimes another surgery is needed to fix the problem.</detail><detail>Wear and tear of the moving parts of your new joint over time. Small pieces may break off and damage the bone. This may require another operation to replace the moving parts and repair the bone.</detail><detail>An allergic reaction to the metal parts in some artificial joints. This is very rare. </detail></h2><h2 title="Other Risks"><text>Other problems from hip or knee replacement surgery can occur. Although they are rare, such problems include:</text><detail>Not enough pain relief. Joint replacement surgery relieves the pain and stiffness of arthritis for most people. Some people may still have some symptoms of arthritis. For most people, surgery usually provides enough relief of symptoms for most people.</detail><detail>A longer or shorter leg. Because bone is cut away and a new knee implant is inserted, your leg with the new joint may be longer or shorter than your other leg. This difference is usually about 1/4 of an inch (.5 centimeter). It rarely causes any problems or symptoms. </detail></h2><h2 title="Review Date 9/7/2017"><text>Updated by: C.

<item><title>Rib fracture - aftercare</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000539.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>A rib fracture is a crack or break in one or more of your rib bones. </text><text>Your ribs are the bones in your chest that wrap around your upper body. They connect your breastbone to your spine. </text></h2><h2 title="More About Your Injury"><text>A rib fracture can be very painful because your ribs move when you breathe, cough, and move your upper body.</text><text>The ribs in the middle of the chest are the ones that break most often.</text><text>Rib fractures often occur with other chest and organ injuries. So, your health care providers will also check to see if you have any other injuries.</text></h2><h2 title="What to Expect"><text>Healing takes at least 6 weeks.</text><text>If you injure other body organs, you may need to stay in the hospital. Otherwise, you can heal at home. Most people with broken ribs do not need surgery.</text><text>In the emergency room, you may have received a strong medicine (such as a nerve block or narcotics) if you were in severe pain.</text><text>You will not have a belt or a bandage around your chest because these would keep your ribs from moving when you breathe or cough. This may lead to a lung infection (pneumonia).</text></h2><h2 title="Pain Relief"><text>Apply an ice pack 20 minutes of every hour you are awake for the first 2 days, then 10 to 20 minutes 3 times daily as needed to reduce pain and swelling. Wrap the ice pack in a cloth before applying to the injured area.</text><text>You may need prescription pain medicines (narcotics) to keep your pain under control while your bones heal.</text><detail>Take these medicines on the schedule your provider prescribed.</detail><detail>DO NOT drink alcohol, drive, or operate heavy machinery while you are taking these medicines.</detail><detail>To avoid becoming constipated, drink more fluids, eat high-fiber foods, and use stool softeners.</detail><detail>To avoid nausea or vomiting, try taking your pain medicines with food. </detail><text>If your pain is not severe, you can use ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) or naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn). You can buy these pain medicines at the store.</text><detail>These should be avoided for the first 24 hours after your injury since they may lead to bleeding.</detail><detail>Talk with your provider before using these medicines if you have heart disease, high blood pressure, kidney disease, liver disease, or have had stomach ulcers or internal bleeding in the past.</detail><detail>DO NOT take more than the amount recommended on the bottle or by your provider. </detail><text>Acetaminophen (Tylenol) may also be used for pain by most people.</text><text>Tell your provider about any other medicines you are taking as drug interactions may occur.</text></h2><h2 title="Activity"><text>To help prevent a collapsed lung or lung infection, do slow deep-breathing and gentle coughing exercises every 2 hours. Holding a pillow or blanket against your injured rib can make these less painful. You may need to take your pain medicine first. Your provider may tell you to use a device called a spirometer to help with the breathing exercises. These exercises help prevent a partial lung collapse and pneumonia.</text><text>It is important to stay active. DO NOT rest in bed all day. Your provider will talk with you about when you can return to: </text><detail>Your everyday activities</detail><detail>Work, which will depend on the type of job you have</detail><detail>Sports or other high impact activity </detail><text>While you heal, avoid movements that put painful pressure on your ribs. These include doing crunches and pushing, pulling, or lifting heavy objects.</text></h2><h2 title="Follow-up"><text>Your provider will make sure you are doing your exercises and that your pain is under control so that you can be active. </text><text>There is usually no need for taking x-rays as you heal, unless you develop fever, cough, increasing pain or difficulty breathing. </text></h2><h2 title="When to Call the Doctor"><text>Call your doctor if you have:</text><detail>Pain that does not allow deep breathing or coughing despite using pain relievers</detail><detail>Fever</detail><detail>Cough or increase in mucus that you cough up</detail><detail>Shortness of breath</detail><detail>Side effects of pain medicine such as nausea, vomiting, or constipation, or allergic reactions, such as skin rashes, facial swelling, or difficulty breathing</detail><text>People with asthma or emphysema are at increased risk of developing complications from a rib fracture, such as breathing problems or infections.</text></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>Broken rib - aftercare</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 4/8/2018"><text>Updated by: Jacob L.

But you may have some concerns about what it will be like. Knowing your rights may help ease any anxiety.</text><text>Several laws protect your right to work. In most cases, to be protected by these laws, you need to tell your employer that you have had cancer. However, your employer must protect your privacy. An employer also cannot ask about your treatment, health, or chance of recovery.</text><text>Learn about your legal rights as a cancer survivor and the laws that protect you.</text></h2><h2 title="The American Disabilities Act"><text>This law can protect you if your company has 15 or more people on staff.

Some cancer or treatment side effects like fatigue, pain, and trouble concentrating, are considered disabilities. </text><text>Reasonable accommodations might include:</text><detail>Flexible work hours</detail><detail>Ability to work from home on some days</detail><detail>Time off for doctor appointments</detail><detail>Change in duties if you can no longer do your old job</detail><detail>Work breaks so you can take medication or call your health care provider </detail><text>You can request a reasonable accommodation at any point while you are working. For instance, you can make a request on your first day back and after several months. Your employer may ask for a letter from your doctor, but cannot ask to see your medical records. </text></h2><h2 title="The Family Medical Leave Act"><text>This law applies to workplaces with more than 50 employees. It allows people with cancer and other serious illness to take unpaid leave without risking losing their job. It also covers family members who need to take time off to care for their loved one. </text><text>Under this law, you have the following rights:</text><detail>12 weeks of unpaid leave. If you are on leave for more than 12 weeks in a year, your employer does not have to keep a position open for you.</detail><detail>Ability to return to work as long as you return within 12 weeks.</detail><detail>Ability to work fewer hours if you need to. If you cannot do your old job, your employer can transfer you. Your rate of pay and benefits must be comparable. </detail><text>You have the following responsibilities under the Family and Medical Leave Act:</text><detail>You must give your employer 30-days notice or as much time as you can before taking leave.</detail><detail>You must schedule your health care visits so they disrupt work as little as possible.</detail><detail>You must provide a doctor's letter if your employer requests it.</detail><detail>You must get a second opinion if your employer requests one, as long as the company covers the cost. </detail></h2><h2 title="The Affordable Care Act"><text>The Affordable Care Act went into effect on January 1, 2014.

Set up ongoing meetings to check in about how things are going.</detail><detail>Tell your manager about what types of follow-up appointments you may need.</detail><detail>Discuss what accommodations you may need, if any.</detail><detail>Try to be realistic about what you can handle. You may need to ease into a full workload.</detail><detail>Decide whether to tell your coworkers about your cancer. Who you tell is up to you. You may only want to tell a few people, or you may decide to let everyone know. Keep in mind that not everyone will react the same way. </detail></h2><h2 title="Looking for a New Job"><text>It is your choice whether to talk about your cancer history during a job interview. It is not legal for the person interviewing you to ask about your health or medical condition. Even if you tell them you had cancer, the person interviewing you cannot ask questions about your diagnosis or treatment.</text><text>If you have gaps in your work history, you can organize your resume by skills rather than dates of employment. If a question comes up about the time when you could not work, it is up to you to decide how much information to share. If you do not want to talk about cancer, you may just want to say you were out of work for a health-related issue, but that it is in the past. </text><text>You may find it helpful to talk a career counselor or oncology social worker about job-hunt strategies. You can also practice role-playing so you know how to handle certain questions.</text></h2><h2 title="Where to Get Help"><text>If you feel you have been discriminated against, you can contact a counselor at the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission -- www.eeoc.gov/federal/fed_employees/counselor.cfm.

If you would like to return to a more intense sport or a contact sport, talk to your provider and physical therapist about whether you can do this safely. Contact sports or more intense sports may not be a good choice for you if you: </text><detail>Have had surgery on more than one level of your spine, especially spinal fusion</detail><detail>Have more severe spine disease in the area where the middle of the spine and the lower spine join</detail><detail>Have had repeated injury or surgery in the same area of your spine</detail><detail>Have had back injuries that resulted in muscle weakness or nerve injury</detail><text>Doing any activity over too long a period can cause injury. Activities that involve contact, heavy or repetitive lifting, or twisting (especially when moving or at high-speed) can also cause injury.</text></h2><h2 title="When to Return to a Sport"><text>These are some general tips about when to return to sports and conditioning. It may be safe to return to your sport when you have: </text><detail>No pain or only mild pain</detail><detail>Normal or almost normal range of motion without pain</detail><detail>Regained enough strength in the muscles related to your sport</detail><detail>Regained the endurance you need for your sport </detail><text>The type of back injury or problem you are recovering from is a factor for deciding when you can return to your sport. These are general guidelines: </text><detail>After a back sprain or strain, you should be able to start to return to your sport within a few days to several weeks if you don't have any more symptoms.</detail><detail>After a slipped disk in one area of your spine, with or without having a surgery called diskectomy, most people recover in 1 to 6 months. You must do exercises to strengthen the muscles that surround your spine and hip for a safe return to sports. Many people are able to return to a competitive level of sports.</detail><detail>After having disk and other problems in your spine. You should be under the care of a provider or physical therapist. You should take even more care after surgeries that involve fusing bones of your spine together. </detail></h2><h2 title="Making Muscles and Ligaments Stronger and More Flexible"><text>Large muscles of your abdomen, upper legs, and buttocks attach to your spine and pelvic bones. They help stabilize and protect your spine during activity and sports. Weakness in these muscles may be part of the reason you first injured your back. After resting and treating your symptoms after your injury, these muscles will most likely be even weaker and less flexible. </text><text>Getting these muscles back to the point where they support your spine well is called core strengthening. Your provider and physical therapist will teach you exercises to strengthen these muscles. It is important to do these exercises correctly to prevent further injury and strengthen your back. </text><text>Once you are ready to return to your sport: </text><detail>Warm up with an easy movement such as walking. This will help increase blood flow to the muscles and ligaments in your back.</detail><detail>Stretch the muscles in your upper and lower back and your hamstrings (large muscles in the back of your thighs) and quadriceps (large muscles in the front of your thighs). </detail><text>When you are ready to begin the movements and actions involved in your sport, start slowly. Before going full force, take part in the sport at a less intense level. See how you feel that night and the next day before you slowly increase the force and intensity of your movements. </text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 7/13/2016"><text>Updated by: Linda J.

It can put you at risk for health problems such as high blood pressure, stomachaches, headaches, anxiety, and depression. Using relaxation techniques can help you feel calm. These exercises can also help you manage stress and ease the effects of stress on your body.</text></h2><h2 title="How Relaxation Helps"><text>When you feel stress, your body responds by releasing hormones that increase your blood pressure and raise your heart rate. This is called the stress response. </text><text>Relaxation techniques can help your body relax and lower your blood pressure and heart rate. This is called a relaxation response. There are several exercises you can try. See which ones work best for you. </text></h2><h2 title="Deep Breathing"><text>One of the simplest ways to relax is by practicing deep breathing. You can do deep breathing almost anywhere.</text><detail>Sit still or lie down and place one hand on your stomach. Put your other hand over your heart.</detail><detail>Inhale slowly until you feel your stomach rise.</detail><detail>Hold your breath for a moment.</detail><detail>Exhale slowly, feeling your stomach fall. </detail><text>There are also many other types of breathing techniques you can learn.

You might focus on your breath, an object, or a set of words.</detail><detail>Quiet. Most meditation is done in a quiet area to limit distractions.</detail><detail>Body position. Most people think of meditation done while sitting, but it can also be done lying down, walking, or standing.</detail><detail>An open attitude. This means that you stay open to thoughts that come into your mind during meditation. Instead of judging these thoughts, you let them go by bringing your attention back to your focus.</detail><detail>Relaxed breathing. During meditation, you breathe slowly and calmly. This also helps you relax. </detail></h2><h2 title="Biofeedback"><text>Biofeedback teaches you how to control some of your body's functions, such as your heart rate or certain muscles.</text><text>In a typical session, a biofeedback therapist attaches sensors to different areas of your body. These sensors measure your skin temperature, brain waves, breathing, and muscle activity. You can see these readings on a monitor. Then you practice changing your thoughts, behaviors, or emotions to help control your body's responses. Over time, you can learn to change them without using the monitor.</text></h2><h2 title="Progressive Relaxation"><text>This is another simple technique that you can do almost anywhere. Starting with your toes and feet, focus on tightening your muscles for a few moments and then releasing them. Continue with this process, working your way up your body, focusing on one group of muscles at a time.</text></h2><h2 title="Yoga"><text>Yoga is an ancient practice rooted in Indian philosophy. The practice of yoga combines postures or movements with focused breathing and meditation. The postures are meant to increase strength and flexibility.

This article tells you how to take care of yourself at home after the surgery.</text></h2><h2 title="When You're in the Hospital"><text>You had surgery to remove all of your prostate, some tissue near your prostate, and probably some lymph nodes. This was done to treat prostate cancer.</text><detail>Your surgeon may have made an incision (cut) either in the lower part of your belly or in the area between your scrotum and anus (open surgery).</detail><detail>Your surgeon may have used a robot or a laparoscope (a thin tube with a tiny camera on the end). You will have several small incisions on your belly.</detail></h2><h2 title="What to Expect at Home"><text>You may be tired and need more rest for 3 to 4 weeks after you go home. You may have pain or discomfort in your belly or the area between your scrotum and anus for 2 to 3 weeks.</text><text>You will go home with a catheter (tube) to drain urine from your bladder. This will be removed after 1 to 3 weeks.</text></h2><h2 title="Wound Care"><text>Change the dressing over your surgical wound once a day, or sooner if it becomes soiled. Your health care provider will tell you when you do not need to keep your wound covered. Keep the wound area clean by washing it with mild soap and water.</text><detail>You may remove the wound dressings and take showers if sutures, staples, or glue were used to close your skin. Cover the incision with plastic wrap before showering for the first week if you have tape (Steri-Strips) over it.</detail><detail>DO NOT soak in a bathtub or hot tub, or go swimming, as long as you have a catheter. You can do these activities after the catheter is removed and your doctor has told you it is OK to do so.</detail><text>Your scrotum may be swollen for 2 to 3 weeks if you had open surgery. You may need to wear either a support (like a jock strap) or brief underwear until the swelling goes away. While you are in bed, you may use a towel under your scrotum for support.</text><text>You may have a drain (called a Jackson-Pratt, or JP drain) below your belly button that helps extra fluid drain from your body and prevent it from building up in your body. Your provider will take it out after 1 to 3 days.</text></h2><h2 title="Urinary Catheters"><text>While you have a urinary catheter:</text><detail>You may feel spasms in your bladder. Your provider can give you medicine for this.</detail><detail>You will need to make sure your indwelling catheter is working properly. You will also need to know how to clean the tube and the area where it attaches to your body so that you do not get an infection or skin irritation.</detail><detail>The urine in your drainage bag may be a darker red color. This is normal. </detail><text>After your catheter is removed:</text><detail>You may have burning when you pee, blood in the urine, frequent urination, and an urgent need to urinate.</detail><detail>You may have some urine leakage (incontinence). This should improve over time. You should have almost normal bladder control within 3 to 6 months.</detail><detail>You will learn exercises (called Kegel exercises) that strengthen the muscles in your pelvis. You can do these exercises any time you are sitting or lying down. </detail></h2><h2 title="Other Self-care"><text>DO NOT drive the first 3 weeks after you come home. Avoid long car trips if you can. If you need to take a long car trip, stop at least every 2 hours. </text><text>DO NOT lift anything heavier than a 1-gallon (4 liters) milk jug for the first 6 weeks. You can slowly work back up to your normal exercise routine after that. You can do everyday activities around the house if you feel up to it. But expect to get tired more easily.</text><text>Drink at least 8 glasses of water a day, eat a lot of fruits and vegetables, and take stool softeners to prevent constipation. DO NOT strain during bowel movements.</text><text>DO NOT take aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn), or other similar medicines for 2 weeks after your surgery. They may cause problems with blood clots.</text></h2><h2 title="Sexual Problems After Surgery"><text>Sexual problems you may notice are:</text><detail>Your erection may not be as rigid. Some men are not able to have an erection.</detail><detail>Your orgasm may not be as intense or pleasurable as before.</detail><detail>You may notice no semen at all when you have an orgasm. </detail><text>These problems may get better or even go away, but it may take many months or more than a year.

Your skin may turn red, peel, or itch. You should treat your skin with care while receiving radiation therapy.</text></h2><h2 title="Causes"><text>External radiation therapy uses high-powered x-rays or particles to kill cancer cells. The rays or particles are aimed directly at the tumor from outside of the body. Radiation therapy also damages or kills healthy cells. During treatment, skin cells do not have enough time to grow back between radiation sessions. This causes side effects.</text></h2><h2 title="Skin Side Effects"><text>Side effects depend on the dose of radiation, how often you have the therapy, and the part of your body the radiation is focused on, such as:</text><detail>Abdomen</detail><detail>Brain</detail><detail>Breast</detail><detail>Chest</detail><detail>Mouth and neck</detail><detail>Pelvis (between the hips)</detail><detail>Prostate</detail><detail>Skin</detail><text>Two weeks or so after radiation treatment starts, you may notice skin changes such as:</text><detail>Red or "sun burned" skin</detail><detail>Darkened skin</detail><detail>Itching</detail><detail>Bumps, rash</detail><detail>Peeling</detail><detail>Hair loss in the area being treated</detail><detail>Thinning or thickening of skin</detail><detail>Soreness or swelling of the area</detail><detail>Sensitivity or numbness</detail><detail>Skin sores</detail><text>Most of these symptoms will go away after your treatments have stopped.

These indicate where to aim the radiation. </text><text>Take care of the skin in the treatment area.</text><detail>Wash gently with a mild soap and lukewarm water only. Don't scrub. Pat your skin dry.</detail><detail>Don't use lotions, ointments, makeup, or perfumed powders or products. They can irritate skin or interfere with treatment. Ask your provider what products you can use and when.</detail><detail>If you normally shave the treatment area, only use an electric razor. Don't use shaving products.</detail><detail>Don't scratch or rub your skin.</detail><detail>Wear loose-fitting, soft fabrics next to your skin, such as cotton. Avoid tight-fitting clothes and rough fabrics like wool.</detail><detail>Don't use bandages or adhesive tape on the area.</detail><detail>If you are being treated for breast cancer, do not wear a bra, or wear a loose-fitting bra with no underwire. Ask your provider about wearing your breast prosthesis, if you have one.</detail><detail>Don't use heating pads or cold packs on the skin.</detail><detail>Ask your provider if it's OK to swim in pools, salt water, lakes, or ponds. </detail><text>Keep the treatment area out of direct sunlight while undergoing treatment.</text><detail>Wear clothes that protects you from the sun, such as a hat with a broad brim, a shirt with long sleeves, and long pants.</detail><detail>Use sunscreen. </detail><text>The treated area will be more sensitive to the sun.

This may happen along the entire cut or just part of it. Your doctor may decide not to close it again with sutures (stitches).</text></h2><h2 title="What to Expect at Home"><text>If your doctor does not close your wound again with sutures, you need to care for it at home, since it may take time to heal. The wound will heal from the bottom to the top. A dressing helps absorb drainage and keep the skin from closing before the wound underneath fills in.</text></h2><h2 title="Proper Handwashing "><text>It is important to clean your hands before you change your dressing. You can use an alcohol-based cleanser. Or, you can wash your hands using these steps:</text><detail>Take all jewelry off your hands.</detail><detail>Wet your hands, pointing them downward under warm running water.</detail><detail>Add soap and wash your hands for 15 to 30 seconds (sing "Happy Birthday" or the "Alphabet Song" one time through).

<item><title>Surgical wound care - closed</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000738.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>An incision is a cut through the skin made during surgery. It is also called a "surgical wound." Some incisions are small. Others are very long. The size of an incision depends on the kind of surgery you had.</text><text>To close your incision, your doctor used one of the following:</text><detail>Stitches (sutures)</detail><detail>Clips</detail><detail>Staples</detail><detail>Skin glue </detail><text>Proper wound care can help prevent infection and reduce scarring as your surgical wound heals.</text></h2><h2 title="Caring for Your Wound"><text>When you come home after surgery, you may have a dressing on your wound. Dressings do several things, including:</text><detail>Protect your wound from germs</detail><detail>Reduce the risk of infection</detail><detail>Cover your wound so that stitches or staples do not catch on clothing</detail><detail>Protect the area as it heals</detail><detail>Soak up any fluids that leak from your wound </detail><text>You can leave your original dressing in place for as long as your health care provider says. You will want to change it sooner if it becomes wet or soaked with blood or other fluids.</text><text>DO NOT wear tight clothing that rubs against the incision while it is healing.</text><text>Your provider will tell you how often to change your dressing. Your provider likely gave you specific instructions on how to change the dressing. The steps outlined below will help you remember.</text><text>Getting prepared:</text><detail>Clean your hands before touching the dressing. Wash your hands with soap and warm water. Also clean under your nails. Rinse, then dry your hands with a clean towel.</detail><detail>Make sure you have all the supplies handy.</detail><detail>Have a clean work surface. </detail><text>Remove the old dressing.</text><detail>Put on clean medical gloves if your wound is infected (red or oozing), or if you are changing the dressing for someone else. The gloves do not need to be sterile.</detail><detail>Carefully loosen the tape from the skin.</detail><detail>If the dressing sticks to the wound, moisten it gently with water and try again, unless your doctor instructed you to pull it off dry.</detail><detail>Put the old dressing in a plastic bag and set it aside.</detail><detail>Remove the gloves if you had them on. Throw them in the same plastic bag as the old dressing.</detail><detail>Wash your hands again. </detail><text>When you put on a new dressing:</text><detail>Make sure your hands are clean. Put on clean gloves if your own wound is infected, or if you are putting on dressing for someone else.</detail><detail>DO NOT touch the inside of the dressing.</detail><detail>DO NOT apply antibiotic cream unless your doctor tells you to.</detail><detail>Place the dressing over the wound and tape down all 4 sides.</detail><detail>Put the old dressing, tape, and other trash in the plastic bag. Seal the bag and throw it away. </detail><text>If you have non-dissolvable stitches or staples, the provider will remove them. DO NOT pull at your stitches or try to remove them on your own.</text></h2><h2 title="Bathing or Showering"><text>Your provider will let you know when it is OK to shower or bathe after surgery. Usually it is fine to shower after 24 hours. Keep in mind:</text><detail>Showers are better than baths because the wound doesn't soak in the water. Soaking the wound could cause it to reopen or become infected.</detail><detail>Remove the dressing before bathing unless told otherwise. Some dressings are waterproof. The provider may suggest covering the wound with a plastic bag to keep it dry.</detail><detail>If your provider gives the OK, gently rinse the wound with water as you bathe. DO NOT rub or scrub the wound.</detail><detail>DO NOT use lotions, powders, cosmetics, or any other skin care products on the wound.</detail><detail>Gently pat dry the area around the wound with a clean towel. Let the wound air dry.</detail><detail>Apply a new dressing.</detail><text>At some point during the healing process, you will not need a dressing anymore. Your provider will tell you when you can leave your wound uncovered.</text></h2><h2 title="When to Call the Doctor"><text>Call your provider if there are any of the following changes around the incision:</text><detail>More redness or pain</detail><detail>Swelling or bleeding</detail><detail>The wound is larger or deeper</detail><detail>The wound looks dried out or dark </detail><text>You should also call your doctor if the drainage coming from or around the incision increases or becomes thick, tan, green, or yellow, or smells bad (pus). </text><text>Also call if your temperature is above 100°F (37.7°C) for more than 4 hours.</text></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>Surgical incision care; Closed wound care</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 6/11/2018"><text>Updated by: Debra G.

It may have been horizontal (sideways) or vertical (up and down). Your gallbladder, bile duct, spleen, parts of your stomach and small intestine, and lymph nodes may also have been taken out.</text></h2><h2 title="What To Expect at Home"><text>Your doctor will give you a prescription for pain medicines. Get it filled when you go home so you have it when you need it. Take your pain medicine when you start having pain. Waiting too long to take it will allow your pain to get worse than it should.</text><text>You may have staples in the wound, or dissolving stitches under the skin with a liquid adhesive on the skin. Mild redness and swelling for the first couple of weeks are normal. Pain around the wound site will last 1 or 2 weeks. It should get better each day.</text><text>You will have bruising or skin redness around your wound. This will go away on its own.</text><text>You may have drains at the site of your surgery when you leave the hospital. The nurse will tell you how to care for the drains. </text><text>DO NOT take aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), or naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn), unless directed by your doctor, as these medicines may increase bleeding.</text></h2><h2 title="Activity"><text>You should be able to do most of your regular activities in 6 to 8 weeks. Before that:</text><detail>DO NOT lift anything heavier than 10 to 15 pounds (4.5 to 7 kilograms) until you see your doctor.</detail><detail>Avoid all strenuous activity. This includes heavy exercising, weightlifting, and other activities that make you breathe hard or strain.</detail><detail>Taking short walks and using stairs are OK.</detail><detail>Light housework is OK.</detail><detail>Do not push yourself too hard. Gradually increase how much you exercise.</detail><detail>Learn what you can do to keep yourself safe in the bathroom and prevent falls at home. </detail></h2><h2 title="Wound care"><text>Your health care provider will explain how to care for your surgical wound. You may remove the wound dressings (bandages) and take showers if sutures (stitches), staples, or glue were used to close your skin.</text><text>If staples were used to close your incision, your doctor will remove them about a week or so after surgery.</text><text>If tape strips were used to close your incision:</text><detail>Cover your incision with plastic wrap before showering for the first couple of days after surgery.</detail><detail>Do not try to wash off the tape strips. They will fall off on their own in about a week.</detail><detail>Do not soak in a bathtub or hot tub or go swimming until your doctor tells you it is OK.</detail></h2><h2 title="Diet and Nutrition"><text>Before you leave the hospital, check with the dietitian about what foods you should eat at home.</text><detail>You may need to take pancreatic enzymes and insulin after your surgery. Your doctor will prescribe these if needed. It may take time to get to the right dosages of these medicines.</detail><detail>Be aware that you may have trouble digesting fat after your surgery.</detail><detail>Try to eat foods that are high in protein and carbohydrates and low in fat. It may be easier to eat several small meals instead of large ones.</detail><detail>Tell your provider if you are having a problem with loose stools (diarrhea). </detail></h2><h2 title="Follow-up"><text>You'll be scheduled for a follow-up visit with your surgeon 1 to 2 weeks after you leave the hospital. Be sure to keep the appointment.</text><text>You may need other cancer treatments such as chemotherapy or radiation. Discuss these with your doctor.</text></h2><h2 title="When To Call the Doctor "><text>Call your surgeon if:</text><detail>You have a fever of 101°F (38.3°C) or higher.</detail><detail>Your surgical wound is bleeding, or is red or warm to the touch.</detail><detail>You have problems with the drain. </detail><detail>Your surgical wound has thick, red, brown, yellow or green, or milky drainage.</detail><detail>You have pain that is not helped with your pain medicines.</detail><detail>It is hard to breathe.</detail><detail>You have a cough that does not go away.</detail><detail>You cannot drink or eat.</detail><detail>You have nausea, diarrhea or constipation that is not controlled.</detail><detail>Your skin or the white part of your eyes turns yellow.</detail><detail>Your stools are a gray color.</detail></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>Pancreaticoduodenectomy; Whipple procedure; Open distal pancreatectomy and splenectomy; Laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 5/15/2017"><text>Updated by: Debra G.

<item><title>Suprapubic catheter care</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000145.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>A suprapubic catheter (tube) drains urine from your bladder. It is inserted into your bladder through a small hole in your belly. You may need a catheter because you have urinary incontinence (leakage), urinary retention (not being able to urinate), surgery that made a catheter necessary, or another health problem.</text></h2><h2 title="What to Expect at Home"><text>Your catheter will make it easier for you to drain your bladder and avoid infections. You will need to make sure it is working properly. You will also need to know how to change it. You will need to change it every 4 to 6 weeks.</text><text>You can learn how to change your catheter in a sterile (very clean) way. After some practice, it will get easier. Your health care provider will change it for you the first time.</text><text>Sometimes family members, a nurse, or others may be able to help you change your catheter.</text><text>You will get a prescription to buy special catheters at a medical supply store. Other supplies you will need are sterile gloves, a catheter pack, syringes, sterile solution to clean with, gel such as K-Y Jelly or Surgilube (DO NOT use Vaseline), and a drainage bag. You may also get medicine for your bladder.</text><text>Drink 8 to 12 glasses of water every day for a few days after you change your catheter. Avoid physical activity for a week or two. It is best to keep the catheter taped to your belly.</text><text>Once your catheter is in place, you will need to empty your urine bag only a few times a day.</text></h2><h2 title="Caring for Your Skin Near your Catheter"><text>Follow these guidelines for good health and skin care:</text><detail>Check the catheter site a few times a day. Check for redness, pain, swelling, or pus.</detail><detail>Wash the area around your catheter every day with mild soap and water. Gently pat it dry. Showers are fine. Ask your providers about bathtubs, swimming pools, and hot tubs.</detail><detail>DO NOT use creams, powders, or sprays near the site.</detail><detail>Apply bandages around the site the way your provider showed you. </detail></h2><h2 title="Make Sure Your Catheter Is Working"><text>You will need to check your catheter and bag throughout the day.</text><detail>Make sure your bag is always below your waist. This will keep urine from going back into your bladder.</detail><detail>Try not to disconnect the catheter more than you need to. Keeping it connected will make it work better.</detail><detail>Check for kinks, and move the tubing around if it is not draining.</detail></h2><h2 title="Changing Your Catheter"><text>You will need to change the catheter about every 4 to 6 weeks. Always wash your hands with soap and water before changing it.</text><text>Once you have your sterile supplies ready, lie down on your back. Put on two pairs of sterile gloves, one over the other. Then:</text><detail>Make sure your new catheter is lubricated on the end you will insert into your belly.</detail><detail>Clean around the site using a sterile solution.</detail><detail>Deflate the balloon with one of the syringes.</detail><detail>Take out the old catheter slowly.</detail><detail>Take off the top pair of gloves.</detail><detail>Insert the new catheter as far in as the other one was placed.</detail><detail>Wait for urine to flow. It may take a few minutes.</detail><detail>Inflate the balloon using 5 to 8 ml of sterile water.</detail><detail>Attach your drainage bag. </detail><text>If you are having trouble changing your catheter, call your provider right away. Insert a catheter into your urethra through your urinary opening in your labia (women) or penis (men) to pass urine. DO NOT remove the suprapubic catheter because the hole can close up quickly. However, if you have removed the catheter already and cannot get it back in, call your provider or go to the local emergency room.</text></h2><h2 title="When to Call the Doctor"><text>Call your provider if:</text><detail>You are having trouble changing your catheter or emptying your bag.</detail><detail>Your bag is filling up quickly, and you have an increase in urine.</detail><detail>You are leaking urine.</detail><detail>You notice blood in your urine a few days after you leave the hospital.</detail><detail>You are bleeding at the insertion site after you change your catheter, and it does not stop within 24 hours.</detail><detail>Your catheter seems blocked.</detail><detail>You notice grit or stones in your urine.</detail><detail>Your supplies do not seem to be working (balloon is not inflating or other problems).</detail><detail>You notice a smell or change in color in your urine, or your urine is cloudy.</detail><detail>You have signs of infection (a burning sensation when you urinate, fever, or chills). </detail></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>SPT</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 2/21/2017"><text>Updated by: Jennifer Sobol, DO, Urologist with the Michigan Institute of Urology, West Bloomfield, MI.

<item><title>Sun protection</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000378.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>Many skin changes, such as skin cancer, wrinkles, and age spots are caused by exposure to the sun. This is because the damage caused by the sun is permanent.</text></h2><h2 title="Sun Exposure and Skin Changes"><text>The two types of sun rays that can injure the skin are ultraviolet A (UVA) and ultraviolet B (UVB). UVA affects the deep layers of skin. UVB damages the outermost layers of the skin and causes sunburn.</text><text>The best way to lower your risk of skin changes is to protect your skin from the sun. This includes using sunscreen and other protective measures.</text><detail>Avoid sun exposure, particularly from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. when UV rays are the strongest.</detail><detail>Remember that the higher the altitude, the quicker your skin burns with sun exposure. The start of summer is when UV rays can cause the most skin damage.</detail><detail>Use sun protection, even on cloudy days. Clouds and haze don't protect you from the sun.</detail><detail>Avoid surfaces that reflect light, such as water, sand, concrete, snow, and areas that are painted white.</detail><detail>DO NOT use sun lamps and tanning beds (tanning salons). Spending 15 to 20 minutes at a tanning salon is as dangerous as a day spent in the sun. </detail></h2><h2 title="Sun-protective Clothing"><text>Adults and children should wear clothing to protect skin against the sun. This is in addition to applying sunscreen. Suggestions for clothing include:</text><detail>Long-sleeve shirts and long pants. Look for loose-fitting, unbleached, tightly woven fabrics. The tighter the weave, the more protective the garment.</detail><detail>A hat with a wide brim that can shade your whole face from the sun. A baseball cap or visor does not protect the ears or sides of the face.</detail><detail>Special clothing that protects the skin by absorbing UV rays.</detail><detail>Sunglasses that block UVA and UVB rays, for anyone above age 1. </detail></h2><h2 title="Sunscreen Guidelines"><text>It is important not to rely on sunscreen alone for sun protection. Wearing sunscreen is also not a reason to spend more time in the sun. </text><text>The best sunscreens to choose include:</text><detail>Sunscreens that block both UVA and UVB. These products are labeled as broad spectrum.</detail><detail>Sunscreen labeled SPF 30 or higher. SPF stands for sun protection factor. This number indicates how well the product protects the skin from UVB damage.</detail><detail>Those that are water resistant, even if your activities do not include swimming. This type of sunscreen stays on your skin longer when your skin gets wet. </detail><text>Avoid products that combine sunscreen and insect repellent. Sunscreen needs to be reapplied often. Insect repellent applied too often could be harmful.</text><text>If your skin is sensitive to the chemicals in sunscreen products, choose a mineral sunscreen such as zinc oxide or titanium dioxide.</text><text>Less expensive products that have the same ingredients work as well as expensive ones.</text><text>When applying sunscreen:</text><detail>Wear it every day when going outdoors, even for a short time.</detail><detail>Apply 30 minutes before going outdoors for best results. This allows time for the sunscreen to be absorbed into your skin.</detail><detail>Remember to use sunscreen during the winter.</detail><detail>Apply a large amount to all exposed areas. This includes your face, nose, ears, and shoulders. DO NOT forget your feet.</detail><detail>Follow package instructions about how often to reapply. This is usually at least every 2 hours.</detail><detail>Always reapply after swimming or sweating.</detail><detail>Use a lip balm with sunscreen. </detail></h2><h2 title="Sun Protection and Children"><text>While in the sun, children should be well covered with clothing, sunglasses, and hats. Children should be kept out of the sun during peak sunlight hours.</text><text>Sunscreens are safe for most toddlers and children. Use products that contain zinc and titanium, as they contain fewer chemicals that may irritate young skin.</text><text>DO NOT use sunscreen on babies younger than 6 months without talking to your doctor or pediatrician first.</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 7/25/2017"><text>Updated by: David L.

<item><title>Substance use - prescription drugs</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000798.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>When a medicine is not taken in the way it is meant to be used and a person is addicted to it, the problem is called prescription drug use disorder. People who have this disorder take the drugs because the chemicals in the medicines have psychoactive effects. Psychoactive means having an effect on the way the brain functions. In short, the drugs are used to get high.</text></h2><h2 title="Types of Drugs That are Misused"><text>Common kinds of drugs that are misused include depressants, opioids, and stimulants.</text><text>DEPRESSANTS</text><text>These medicines are also known as tranquilizers and sedatives.

They are prescribed to treat pain after surgery or a dental procedure. Sometimes they are used to treat severe cough or diarrhea.</text><text>Types of opioids and their street names include:</text><detail>Codeine. There are many medicines that contain codeine as an ingredient, especially ones for cough such as Robitussin A-C and Tylenol with codeine. Street names for codeine alone include captain cody, cody, little c, and school boy. For Tylenol with codeine, street names include T1, T2, T3, T4, and dors and fours. Codeine syrup mixed with soda can have street names such as purple drank, sizzup, or Texas tea.</detail><detail>Fentanyl. Drugs include Actiq, Duragesic, Onsolis, and Sublimaze.

They make the messages between the brain and body move faster. As a result, the person is more alert and physically active. Stimulants such as amphetamines are prescribed to treat health problems such as obesity, narcolepsy, or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).</text><text>Types of stimulants and their street names include:</text><detail>Amphetamines, such as Adderall, Biphetamine, and Dexedrine. Street names include bennies, black beauties, crosses, hearts, LA turnaround, speed, truck drivers, uppers.</detail><detail>Methylphenidate, such as Concerta, Metadate, Quillivant, and Ritalin. Street names include JIF, kibbles and bits, MPH, pineapple, r-ball, skippy, the smart drug, vitamin R. </detail><text>When used to get high, stimulants cause a person to feel excited, very alert, and have increased energy. Some people use the drugs, especially amphetamines, to help them stay awake on the job or to study for a test. Others use them to boost their performance in sports.</text><text>As street drugs, they come as pills. They can be swallowed, injected, smoked, or inhaled through the nose (snorted).</text><text>Harmful effects of stimulants on the body include:</text><detail>Heart problems, such as fast heart rate, irregular heartbeat, increased blood pressure</detail><detail>High body temperature and skin flushing</detail><detail>Loss of appetite and weight loss</detail><detail>Memory loss and problems thinking clearly</detail><detail>Delusions and hallucinations</detail><detail>Mood and emotional problems, such as aggressive or violent behavior</detail><detail>Restlessness and tremors </detail></h2><h2 title="Prescription Drug Addiction"><text>You usually do not get addicted to prescription medicines when you take them at the right dosage to treat your health condition. </text><text>Addiction means your body and mind are dependent on the drug. You are not able to control your use of it and you need it to get through daily life.</text><text>Drug use over a period of time can lead to tolerance. Tolerance means you need more and more of the drug to get the same feeling. And if you try to stop using, your mind and body may have reactions. These are called withdrawal symptoms, and may include:</text><detail>Strong cravings for the drug</detail><detail>Having mood swings from feeling depressed to agitated to anxious</detail><detail>Not being able to concentrate</detail><detail>Seeing or hearing things that are not there (hallucinations)</detail><detail>Physical reactions may include headaches, aches and pains, increased appetite, not sleeping well</detail><detail>Life-threatening symptoms in long-time users of certain drugs </detail></h2><h2 title="Treatment Options"><text>Treatment begins with recognizing there is a problem. Once you decide you want to do something about your drug use, the next step is to get help and support.</text><text>Treatment programs use behavior change techniques through counseling (talk therapy). The goal is to help you understand your behaviors and why you use drugs. Involving family and friends during counseling can help support you keep you from going back to using (relapsing). Treatment programs also teach you how to better deal with situations that led you to use or to relapse in the past.</text><text>With some drug addictions, such as opioids, medicines may also be used to help reduce the effects of opioids on the brain.

This ingredient is found in the leaves and flowering parts of the marijuana plant. Hashish is a substance taken from the tops of female marijuana plants. It contains the highest amount of THC.</text><text>Marijuana is called by many other names, including cannabis, grass, hashish, joint, Mary Jane, pot, reefer, weed.</text><text>Some states in the Unites States permit marijuana to be used legally to treat certain medical problems.

<item><title>Substance use - LSD</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000795.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>LSD stands for lysergic acid diethylamide. It is an illegal street drug that comes as a white powder or clear colorless liquid. It is available in powder, liquid, tablet, or capsule form. LSD is usually taken by mouth. Some people inhale it through the nose (snort) or inject it into a vein (shooting up). </text><text>Street names for LSD include acid, blotter, blotter acid, blue cheer, electric Kool-Aid, hits, Lucy in the sky with diamonds, mellow yellow, microdots, purple haze, sugar cubes, sunshine tabs, and window pane.</text></h2><h2 title="LSD's Effects on Your Brain"><text>LSD is a mind-altering drug. This means it acts on your brain (central nervous system) and changes your mood, behavior, and the way you relate to the world around you. LSD affects the action of a brain chemical called serotonin. Serotonin helps control behavior, mood, the senses, and thinking. </text><text>LSD is in a class of drugs called hallucinogens. These are substances that cause hallucinations. These are things that you see, hear, or feel while awake that appear to be real, but instead of being real, they have been created by the mind. LSD is a very strong hallucinogen. Only a tiny amount is needed to cause effects such as hallucinations.</text><text>LSD users call their hallucinogenic experiences "trips." Depending on how much you take and how your brain responds, a trip may be "good" or "bad." </text><text>A good trip may be stimulating and pleasurable and make you feel:</text><detail>As if you are floating and disconnected from reality.</detail><detail>Joy (euphoria, or "rush") and less inhibition, similar to being drunk from alcohol use.</detail><detail>As if your thinking is extremely clear and that you have superhuman strength and are not afraid of anything. </detail><text>A bad trip can be very unpleasant and frightening:</text><detail>You may have terrifying thoughts.</detail><detail>You may have many emotions at once, or move quickly from feeling one emotion to feeling another.</detail><detail>Your senses may become distorted. Shapes and sizes of objects are altered. Or your senses may "cross over." You may feel or hear colors and see sounds.</detail><detail>Fears that you normally can control are out of control. For example, you may have doom and gloom thoughts, such as thoughts that you will soon die, or that you want to harm yourself or others. </detail><text>The danger of LSD is that its effects are unpredictable. This means when you use it, you do not know if you will have a good trip or a bad trip. </text><text>How fast you feel the effects of LSD depends on how you use it:</text><detail>Taken by mouth: Effects usually start in 20 to 30 minutes. The effects peak in about 2 to 4 hours and last up to 12 hours.</detail><detail>Shooting up: If given through a vein, LSD's effects start within 10 minutes. </detail></h2><h2 title="Harmful Effects of LSD"><text>LSD can harm the body in different ways and lead to health problems such as:</text><detail>Increased heart rate, blood pressure, breathing rate, and body temperature</detail><detail>Sleeplessness, loss of appetite, tremors, sweating</detail><detail>Mental problems, including anxiety, depression, schizophrenia </detail><text>Some LSD users have flashbacks. This is when parts of the drug experience, or trip, return, even without using the drug again. Flashbacks occur during times of increased stress. Flashbacks tend to occur less often and less intensely after stopping use of LSD. Some users who have frequent flashbacks have a hard time living their daily life.</text></h2><h2 title="Tolerance to LSD "><text>LSD is not known to be addicting. But frequent use of LSD can lead to tolerance.

<item><title>Substance use - inhalants</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000794.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>Inhalants are chemical vapors that are breathed in on purpose to get high.</text><text>Inhalant use became popular in the 1960s with teens who sniffed glue. Since then, other kinds of inhalants have become popular. Inhalants are used mostly by younger teens and school-age children, although adults sometimes also use them.</text><text>Street names for inhalants include air blast, bold, chroming, discorama, glad, hippie crack, moon gas, oz, poor man's pot, rush, snappers, whippets, and whiteout. </text></h2><h2 title="Types of Inhalants"><text>Many household products have chemicals that are volatile. Volatile means the chemical produces vapors, which can be breathed in (inhaled). Common types of abused inhalants are:</text><detail>Aerosols, such as air freshener, deodorant, fabric protector, hair spray, vegetable oil spray, and spray paint.</detail><detail>Gases, such as butane (lighter fluid), computer cleaning spray, freon, helium, nitrous oxide (laughing gas), which is found in whipped cream containers, and propane.</detail><detail>Nitrites, which are no longer sold legally. When nitrites are bought illegally, they are often labeled "leather cleaner," "liquid aroma," "room odorizer," or "video head cleaner."</detail><detail>Solvents, such as correction fluid, degreaser, fast-drying glue, felt-tip marker, gasoline, nail polish remover, and paint thinner. </detail></h2><h2 title="Ways Inhalants are Used"><text>Inhalants are breathed in through the mouth or nose. Slang terms for these methods are:</text><detail>Bagging. Inhaling the substance after it has been sprayed or put into a paper or plastic bag.</detail><detail>Ballooning. Inhaling a gas from a balloon.</detail><detail>Dusting. Spraying an aerosol into the nose or mouth.</detail><detail>Glading. Inhaling air-freshener aerosols.</detail><detail>Huffing. Inhaling from a rag soaked with the substance and then held to the face or stuffed in the mouth.</detail><detail>Sniffing. Inhaling a substance directly through the nose.</detail><detail>Snorting. Inhaling a substance directly through the mouth.</detail><text>Other things that are often used to hold inhalant chemicals include empty soda cans, empty perfume bottles, and toilet paper tubes stuffed with rags or toilet paper soaked with the chemical. </text></h2><h2 title="Effects of Inhalants on the Brain"><text>When inhaled, the chemicals are absorbed by the lungs. Within seconds, the chemicals go to the brain, causing the person to feel intoxicated, or high. The high usually involves feeling excited and happy, a feeling similar to being drunk from drinking alcohol. </text><text>Some inhalants cause the brain to release dopamine. Dopamine is a chemical that is involved with mood and thinking. It is also called the feel-good brain chemical.</text><text>Because the high lasts only a few minutes, users try to make the high last longer by inhaling repeatedly for several hours. </text><text>Nitrites are different from other inhalants. Nitrites make blood vessels larger and the heart beat faster. This causes the person to feel very warm and excited. Nitrites are often inhaled to improve sexual performance rather than to get high.</text></h2><h2 title="Harmful Effects of Inhalants"><text>Chemicals in inhalants can harm the body in many ways, leading to health problems such as:</text><detail>Bone marrow damage</detail><detail>Coma</detail><detail>Hearing loss</detail><detail>Heart problems, such as irregular or fast heart rhythms</detail><detail>Loss of bowel and urinary control</detail><detail>Mood changes, such as not caring about anything (apathy), violent behavior, confusion, hallucinations, or depression</detail><detail>Permanent nerve problems, such as numbness, tingling of the hands and feet, weakness, and tremors </detail><text>Inhalants can also be deadly:</text><detail>Irregular or fast heart rhythms can cause the heart to stop pumping blood to the rest of the body. This condition is called sudden sniffing death syndrome.</detail><detail>Suffocation can result when the lungs and brain DO NOT get enough oxygen. This can happen when the levels of chemical vapors are so high in the body that they take the place of oxygen in the blood. Suffocation can also happen if a plastic bag is put over the head when bagging (inhaling from a bag). </detail><text>People who inhale nitrites have a high chance of getting HIV/AIDS and hepatitis B and C. This is because nitrites are used to improve sexual performance. People who use nitrites may have unsafe sex.</text><text>Inhalants can cause birth defects when used during pregnancy.</text></h2><h2 title="Inhalants can be Addictive"><text>People who use inhalants can get addicted to them. This means their mind and body are dependent on the inhalants. They are not able to control their use and they need (crave) them to get through daily life.</text><text>Addiction can lead to tolerance. Tolerance means that more and more of the inhalant is needed to get the same high feeling. And if the person tries to stop using the inhalant, reactions may result. These are called withdrawal symptoms and may include:</text><detail>Strong cravings for the drug</detail><detail>Having mood swings from feeling depressed to agitated to anxious</detail><detail>Not able to concentrate </detail><text>Physical reactions may include headaches, aches and pains, increased appetite, and not sleeping well.</text></h2><h2 title="Signs That Someone is Using Inhalants"><text>It is not always easy to tell if someone is using inhalants. Be alert for these signs:</text><detail>Breath or clothes smell like chemicals</detail><detail>Cough and runny nose all the time</detail><detail>Eyes are watery or pupils are wide open (dilated)</detail><detail>Feeling tired all the time</detail><detail>Hearing or seeing things that are not there (hallucinations)</detail><detail>Hiding empty containers or rags around the house</detail><detail>Mood swings or being angry and irritable for no reason</detail><detail>No appetite, nausea and vomiting, weight loss</detail><detail>Paint or stains on the face, hands, or clothing</detail><detail>Rash or blisters on the face</detail></h2><h2 title="Treatment Options"><text>Treatment begins with recognizing the problem. The next step is getting help and support.</text><text>Treatment programs use behavior change techniques through counseling (talk therapy). The goal is to help the person to understand their behavior and why they use inhalants. Involving family and friends during counseling can help support the person to keep them from going back to using (relapsing).</text><text>At this time, there is no medicine that can help reduce the use of inhalants by blocking their effects. But, scientists are researching such medicines.</text></h2><h2 title="Ongoing Recovery"><text>As the person recovers, encourage the following to help prevent relapse:</text><detail>Keep going to treatment sessions.</detail><detail>Find new activities and goals to replace the ones that involved inhalant use.</detail><detail>Exercise and eat healthy foods. Taking care of the body helps it heal from the harmful effects of inhalants.</detail><detail>Avoid triggers. These triggers can be people and friends the person used inhalants with.

<item><title>Substance use - amphetamines</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000792.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>Amphetamines are drugs. They can be legal or illegal. They are legal when they are prescribed by a doctor and used to treat health problems such as obesity, narcolepsy, or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Using amphetamines can lead to addiction.</text><text>Amphetamines are illegal when they are used without a prescription to get high or improve performance. In this case, they are known as street, or recreational drugs, and using them can lead to addiction. This article describes this aspect of amphetamines.</text></h2><h2 title="Types of Illegal Amphetamines"><text>There are different kinds of street amphetamines. Common ones and some of their slang terms are:</text><detail>Amphetamine: goey, louee, speed, uppers, whiz</detail><detail>Dextroamphetamine (ADHD medicine used illegally): dexies, kiddie-speed, pep pills, uppers; black beauty (when combined with amphetamine)</detail><detail>Methamphetamine (crystal solid form): base, crystal, d-meth, fast, glass, ice, meth, speed, whiz, pure, wax</detail><detail>Methamphetamine (liquid form): leopard's blood, liquid red, ox blood, red speed</detail><text>Illegal amphetamines come in different forms:</text><detail>Pills and capsules</detail><detail>Powder and paste</detail><detail>Crystal</detail><detail>Liquid</detail><text>They can be used in different ways:</text><detail>Swallowed</detail><detail>Dabbed onto the gums</detail><detail>Inhaled through the nose (snorted)</detail><detail>Injected into a vein (shooting up)</detail><detail>Smoked</detail></h2><h2 title="Amphetamines Effects on Your Brain "><text>Amphetamines are stimulant drugs. They make the messages between your brain and body move faster. As a result, you are more alert and physically active. Some people use amphetamines to help them stay awake on the job or to study for a test. Others use them to boost their performance in sports.</text><text>Amphetamines also cause the brain to release dopamine. Dopamine is a chemical that is involved with mood, thinking, and movement. It is also called the feel-good brain chemical. Using amphetamines may cause pleasurable effects such as:</text><detail>Joy (euphoria, or "flash" or "rush") and less inhibition, similar to being drunk</detail><detail>Feeling as if your thinking is extremely clear</detail><detail>Feeling more in control, self-confident </detail><detail>Wanting to be with and talk to people (more sociable)</detail><detail>Increased energy</detail><text>How fast you feel the effects of amphetamines depends on how they are used:</text><detail>Smoking or injecting into a vein (shooting up): Effects (the "rush") start right away and are intense and last a few minutes.</detail><detail>Snorting: Effects (the "high") start in 3 to 5 minutes, are less intense than smoking or injecting, and last 15 to 30 minutes.</detail><detail>Taken by mouth: Effects ("high") start in 15 to 20 minutes and last longer than smoking, injecting, or snorting, depending on how much is taken.</detail></h2><h2 title="Harmful Effects of Amphetamines"><text>Amphetamines can harm the body in many ways, and lead to:</text><detail>Appetite decrease and weight loss</detail><detail>Heart problems such as fast heart rate, irregular heartbeat, increased blood pressure, and heart attack</detail><detail>High body temperature and skin flushing</detail><detail>Memory loss problems thinking clearly, and stroke</detail><detail>Mood and emotional problems such as aggressive or violent behavior, depression, and suicide</detail><detail>Ongoing hallucinations and inability to tell what is real</detail><detail>Restlessness and tremors</detail><detail>Skin sores</detail><detail>Sleep problems</detail><detail>Tooth decay (meth mouth)</detail><detail>Death</detail><text>People who use these drugs, especially methamphetamine, have a high chance of getting HIV and hepatitis B and C. This can be through sharing used needles with someone who has an infection. Or, it can be through having unsafe sex because drug use can lead to risky behaviors.</text><text>Amphetamines can cause birth defects when taken during pregnancy. Also, street drugs are not safe during breastfeeding.</text></h2><h2 title="Amphetamines can be Addictive"><text>You usually DO NOT get addicted to prescription amphetamines when you take them at the right dosage to treat your health condition.</text><text>Addiction happens when you use amphetamines to get high or improve performance. Addiction means your body and mind are dependent on the drug. You are not able to control your use of it and you need it to get through daily life.</text><text>Addiction can lead to tolerance. Tolerance means you need more and more of the drug to get the same high feeling. And if you try to stop using, your mind and body may have reactions. These are called withdrawal symptoms, and may include:</text><detail>Strong craving for the drug</detail><detail>Having mood swings that range from feeling depressed to agitated to anxious</detail><detail>Feeling tired all day</detail><detail>Not able to concentrate</detail><detail>Seeing or hearing things that are not there (hallucinations)</detail><detail>Physical reactions may include headaches, aches and pains, increased appetite, not sleeping well</detail></h2><h2 title="Treatment Options"><text>Treatment begins with recognizing there is a problem.

A stroke is sometimes called a "brain attack." If blood flow is cut off for longer than a few seconds, the brain cannot get nutrients and oxygen. Brain cells can die, causing lasting damage.</text><text>Risk factors are things that increase your chance of getting a disease or condition. This article discusses the risk factors for stroke and things you can do to lessen your risk.</text></h2><h2 title="What is a Risk Factor?"><text>A risk factor is something that increases your chance of getting a disease or health problem. Some risk factors for stroke you cannot change. Some you can. Changing the risk factors that you have control over will help you live a longer, healthier life.</text></h2><h2 title="Risk Factors you Cannot Change"><text>You cannot change these stroke risk factors:</text><detail>Your age. Risk of stroke goes up with age.</detail><detail>Your sex. Men have a higher risk of getting heart disease than women, except in older adults.</detail><detail>Your genes and race. If your parents had a stroke, you are at higher risk. African Americans, Mexican Americans, American Indians, Hawaiians, and some Asian Americans also have a higher risk.</detail><detail>Diseases such as cancer, chronic kidney disease, and some types of arthritis.</detail><detail>Weak areas in an artery wall or abnormal arteries and veins.</detail><detail>Pregnancy. Both during and in the weeks right after the pregnancy. </detail><text>Blood clots from the heart may travel to the brain and cause a stroke. This may happen in people with manmade or infected heart valves. It may also happen because of a heart defect you were born with.</text><text>A very weak heart and abnormal heart rhythm, such as atrial fibrillation, can also cause blood clots.</text></h2><h2 title="Risk Factors you can Change"><text>Some risk factors for stroke that you can change are:</text><detail>Not smoking. If you do smoke, quit. Ask your doctor for help quitting.</detail><detail>Controlling your cholesterol through diet, exercise, and medicines, if needed.</detail><detail>Controlling high blood pressure through diet, exercise, and medicines, if needed.

Women should have no more than 1 drink a day, and men no more than 2 a day.</detail><detail>DO NOT use cocaine and other recreational drugs. </detail><text>Birth control pills can raise your risk of blood clots. Clots are more likely in women who also smoke and who are older than 35.</text><text>Good nutrition is important to your heart health. It will help control some of your risk factors.</text><detail>Choose a diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.</detail><detail>Choose lean proteins, such as chicken, fish, beans and legumes.</detail><detail>Choose low-fat dairy products, such as 1% milk and other low-fat items.</detail><detail>Avoid sodium (salt) and fats found in fried foods, processed foods, and baked goods.</detail><detail>Eat fewer animal products and fewer foods with cheese, cream, or eggs.</detail><detail>Read food labels. Stay away from saturated fat and anything with partially-hydrogenated or hydrogenated fats. These are unhealthy fats. </detail><text>Your doctor may suggest taking aspirin or another blood thinner to help prevent blood clots from forming. DO NOT take aspirin without talking to your doctor first. If you are taking these medicines, take steps to prevent yourself from falling or tripping, which can lead to bleeding.</text><text>Follow these guidelines and the advice of your doctor to lower your chances of stroke.</text></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>Preventing stroke; Stroke - prevention; CVA - prevention; TIA - prevention</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 2/23/2017"><text>Updated by: Amit M.

<item><title>Stress and your heart</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000768.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>Stress is the way your mind and body react to a threat or a challenge. Simple things, like a crying child, can cause stress. You also feel stress when you're in danger, like during a robbery or car crash. Even positive things, like getting married, can be stressful.</text><text>Stress is a fact of life. But when it adds up, it can affect your mental and physical health. Too much stress can also be bad for your heart.</text></h2><h2 title="Your Body and Stress"><text>Your body responds to stress on many levels. First, it releases stress hormones that make you breathe faster. Your blood pressure goes up. Your muscles tense up and your mind races. All of this puts you in gear to deal with an immediate threat.</text><text>The problem is that your body reacts the same way to all types of stress, even when you're not in danger. Over time, these stress-related reactions can cause health problems.</text><text>Common symptoms of stress include:</text><detail>Upset stomach</detail><detail>Inability to focus</detail><detail>Trouble sleeping</detail><detail>Headaches</detail><detail>Anxiety</detail><detail>Mood swings </detail></h2><h2 title="Stress and Heart Disease"><text>When you are stressed, you are also more likely to do things that are bad for your heart, such as smoke, drink heavily, or eat foods high in salt, sugar, and fat.</text><text>Even on its own, constant stress can strain your heart in several ways.</text><detail>Stress raises blood pressure.</detail><detail>Stress increases inflammation in your body.</detail><detail>Stress can increase cholesterol and triglycerides in your blood.</detail><detail>Extreme stress can make your heart beat out of rhythm. </detail></h2><h2 title="Harmful Kinds of Stress for Your Heart"><text>Some sources of stress come at you fast. Others are with you every day. You can protect yourself from some stress. But other stressors are beyond your control. All of these factors have an impact on how stressed you feel and for how long.</text><text>The following types of stress are the worst for your heart.</text><detail>Chronic stress. The daily stress of a bad boss or relationship woes can put constant pressure on your heart.</detail><detail>Helplessness. Long-term (chronic) stress is even more harmful when you feel unable to do anything about it.</detail><detail>Loneliness. Stress can be more harmful if you do not have a support system to help you cope.</detail><detail>Anger. People who blow up in anger have a higher risk of heart attack and stroke.</detail><detail>Acute stress. In rare cases, extremely bad news can bring on heart attack symptoms. This is called broken heart syndrome. This is not the same thing as a heart attack, and most people recover fully.</detail></h2><h2 title="When you Have Heart Disease"><text>Heart disease itself can be stressful. Many people feel anxious and depressed after a heart attack or surgery. This is natural, but it can also get in the way of recovery.</text><text>Stress may be more damaging if you have heart disease. You might feel more pain, have more trouble sleeping, and have less energy for rehab. Depression can also increase your risk for another heart attack. And it can make it harder for you to believe you will be healthy again.</text></h2><h2 title="What you can do"><text>It is important to learn how to manage stress. Finding healthy ways to deal with stress can improve your mood and help you avoid unhealthy behaviors, like overeating or smoking. Try different ways to relax, and see what works best for you, such as:</text><detail>Practicing yoga or meditation</detail><detail>Spending time outdoors in nature</detail><detail>Getting regular exercise</detail><detail>Sitting quietly and focusing on your breathing for 10 minutes each day</detail><detail>Spending time with friends</detail><detail>Escaping with a movie or a good book</detail><detail>Making time every day for the things that reduce stress </detail><text>If you are having trouble managing stress on your own, consider a stress management class. You can find classes at local hospitals, community centers, or adult education programs.</text></h2><h2 title="When to Call the Doctor"><text>Call your health care provider if stress or depression makes it hard to do daily activities. Your provider may recommend therapy to help you get stressful events or feelings under control.</text></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>Coronary heart disease - stress; Coronary artery disease - stress</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 2/22/2018"><text>Updated by: Michael A.

But, there is plenty you can do ahead of time to prepare for labor.</text><text>One of the best ways to prepare is to take a childbirth class to learn what to expect in labor. You will also learn: </text><detail>How to breathe, visualize, and use your labor coach</detail><detail>More about how to manage pain during labor, such as epidural and other medicines</detail><text>Having a plan and knowing ways to manage pain will help you feel more relaxed and in control when the day arrives.</text><text>Here are a few ideas that may be helpful. </text></h2><h2 title="At Home"><text>When labor first begins, be patient and monitor your body. It is not always easy to know when you are going into labor. The steps leading up to labor can last for days.</text><text>Use your time at home to take showers or warm baths, and pack your bag if you have not packed yet.</text><text>Walk around the house, or sit in your baby's room until it is time to go to the hospital.</text><text>Most health care providers recommend that you come to the hospital when:</text><detail>You are having regular, painful contractions. You can use the "411" guide: Contractions are strong and coming every 4 minutes, they last 1 minute, and they have been ongoing for 1 hour.</detail><detail>Your water is leaking or breaking.</detail><detail>You have heavy bleeding.</detail><detail>Your baby is moving less. </detail></h2><h2 title="At the Hospital"><text>Create a peaceful place for giving birth.</text><detail>Dim the lights in your room if you find it soothing.</detail><detail>Listen to music that comforts you.</detail><detail>Keep pictures or comfort items close by where you can see or touch them.</detail><detail>Ask your nurse for extra pillows or blankets to stay comfortable. </detail><text>Keep your mind busy.</text><detail>Bring books, photo albums, games, or other things that will help distract you during early labor. You can also watch TV to keep your mind busy.</detail><detail>Visualize, or see things in your mind the way you would like them to be. You can visualize that your pain goes away. Or, you can visualize your baby in your arms to help you stay focused on your goal.</detail><detail>Meditate. </detail><text>Get as comfortable as you can.</text><detail>Move around, changing positions often. Sitting, squatting, rocking, leaning on the wall, or walking up and down the hallway can help.</detail><detail>Take warm baths or showers in your hospital room.</detail><detail>If heat doesn't feel good, place cool washcloths on your forehead and lower back.</detail><detail>Ask your provider for a birthing ball, which is a big ball you can sit on that will roll under your legs and hips for gentle movement.</detail><detail>DO NOT be afraid to make noise. It is OK to moan, groan, or cry out. Some studies suggest that using your voice goes a long way in helping you deal with pain.</detail><detail>Use your labor coach. Tell them what they can do to help you go through labor. Your coach can give you back massages, keep you distracted, or just cheer you on.</detail><detail>Some women try "hypnobirthing", being under hypnosis while giving birth. Ask your provider for more details about hypnobirthing if you are interested. </detail><text>Speak up. Talk to your labor coach and your providers. Tell them how they can help you get through your labor.</text><text>Ask your provider about pain relief during labor. Most women do not know exactly how their labor will go, how they will cope with the pain, or what they will need until they are in labor. It is important to explore all options and be prepared before your labor begins.</text></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>Pregnancy - getting through labor</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 11/11/2016"><text>Updated by: Irina Burd, MD, PhD, Associate Professor of Gynecology and Obstetrics at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD.

<item><title>Storing your medicines</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000534.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>Storing your medicines properly can help to ensure they work as they should as well as prevent poisoning accidents.</text></h2><h2 title="Store Medicines Safely"><text>Where you store your medicine can affect how well it works. Learn about storing your medicine properly to keep it from getting damaged.</text><text>Take care of your medicine.</text><detail>Know that heat, air, light, and moisture may damage your medicine.</detail><detail>Store your medicines in a cool, dry place. For example, store it in your dresser drawer or a kitchen cabinet away from the stove, sink, and any hot appliances. You can also store medicine in a storage box, on a shelf, in a closet.</detail><detail>If you are like most people, you probably store your medicine in a bathroom cabinet. But the heat and moisture from your shower, bath, and sink may damage your medicine. Your medicines can become less potent, or they may go bad before the expiration date.</detail><detail>Pills and capsules are easily damaged by heat and moisture. Aspirin pills break down into vinegar and salicylic acid. This irritates the stomach.</detail><detail>Always keep medicine in its original container.</detail><detail>Take the cotton ball out of the medicine bottle. The cotton ball pulls moisture into the bottle.</detail><detail>Ask your pharmacist about any specific storage instructions. </detail><text>Keep children safe.</text><detail>Always store your medicine out of reach and out of sight of children.</detail><detail>Store your medicine in a cabinet with a child latch or lock. </detail></h2><h2 title="Do not use Damaged Medicine"><text>Damaged medicine may make you sick.

Throw out medicines that are out of date.</detail><detail>DO NOT keep old or unused medicine around. It goes bad and you should not use it.</detail><detail>DO NOT flush your medicine down the toilet. This is bad for the water supply.</detail><detail>To throw away medicine in the trash, first mix your medicine with something that ruins it, such as coffee grounds or kitty litter. Put the entire mixture in a sealed plastic bag.</detail><detail>You can also bring unused medicines to your pharmacist.</detail><detail>Use community "drug give back" programs if they are available.</detail><detail>Visit the US Food and Drug Administration website for more information: How to dispose of unused medicines. </detail></h2><h2 title="Traveling With Medicine"><text>DO NOT keep medicine in the glove compartment of your car. Medicine can get too hot, cold, or wet there.</text><text>If you are taking an airplane, keep your medicine in your carry-on luggage. To help with security at the airport:</text><detail>Keep medicine in the original bottles.</detail><detail>Ask your health care provider for a copy of all your prescriptions. You may need this in case you lose, run out, or damage your medicine.</detail><detail>If you have diabetes, ask your provider for a letter explaining that you have diabetes and providing a list of all your supplies. You are allowed to carry your medicine, blood glucose meter, and lancet device on a plane.</detail></h2><h2 title="When to Call the Doctor"><text>Call your provider for:</text><detail>New prescriptions before you throw out your old medicine</detail><detail>A letter describing your condition, medicines, and supplies when needed</detail></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>Medications - storing</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 1/14/2018"><text>Updated by: Linda J.

<item><title>Steps to take before you get pregnant</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000513.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>Most women know they need to see a doctor or midwife and make lifestyle changes while pregnant. But, it is just as important to start making changes before you get pregnant. These steps will help you prepare yourself and your body for pregnancy and give you a better chance of having a healthy baby.</text></h2><h2 title="See Your Doctor"><text>See your doctor or midwife before you get pregnant. Even if you feel you are healthy and ready for a pregnancy, your doctor or midwife can do plenty ahead of time to help you prepare.</text><detail>Your doctor or midwife will discuss your current health, your health history, and your family's health history. Some health problems in your family can be passed on to your children. Your doctor may refer you to a genetic counselor.</detail><detail>You may need blood tests, or you may need to get caught up on vaccines before you are pregnant.</detail><detail>Your doctor or midwife will talk with you about medicines, herbs, and supplements you may be taking. They can affect an unborn baby. Your provider may recommend medicine changes before you get pregnant.</detail><detail>Long-term health problems, such as asthma or diabetes, should be stable before you get pregnant.</detail><detail>If you are obese, your provider will recommend losing weight before pregnancy. Doing so will reduce your risk of complications in pregnancy. </detail></h2><h2 title="Stop Smoking, Alcohol, and Drugs. Limit Caffeine"><text>If you smoke, drink alcohol, or use drugs, you should stop before you get pregnant. They can:</text><detail>Make it harder for you to get pregnant</detail><detail>Increase the chance that you will miscarry (lose the baby before it is born). </detail><text>If you need help quitting smoking, alcohol, or drugs, talk to your doctor or midwife.</text><text>Alcohol can harm a growing fetus (unborn baby), even in small amounts. Drinking alcohol while you are pregnant can cause long-term problems for your baby, such as intellectual disability, behavioral issues, learning disabilities, and facial and heart defects.</text><text>Smoking is bad for unborn babies and puts your child at greater risk of health problems later in life.</text><detail>Women who smoke during pregnancy are more likely to have a baby with a lower birth weight.</detail><detail>Smoking also makes it harder for you to recover from your pregnancy. </detail><text>Drugs that are not prescribed by a doctor (including street drugs) can be dangerous for you to take at any point in your life. </text><text>You should also cut down on caffeine when you are trying to get pregnant. Women who daily consume more than 2 cups (500 mL) of coffee or 5 cans (2 L) of soda that contains caffeine may have a harder time getting pregnant and a greater chance of miscarriage.</text><text>Limit unnecessary medicines or supplements. Discuss with your doctor both prescribed and over-the-counter medicines and supplements you take before you try to conceive. Most medicines have some risks, but many have unknown risks and have not been thoroughly studied for safety. If medicines or supplements are not absolutely necessary, DO NOT take them.</text></h2><h2 title="Eat a Balanced Diet "><text>Maintain or strive for a healthy body weight.</text><text>A balanced diet is always good for you. Follow a healthy diet before you get pregnant. A few simple guidelines are:</text><detail>Reduce empty calories, artificial sweeteners, and caffeine.</detail><detail>Eat foods that are high in protein.</detail><detail>Fruits, vegetables, grains, and dairy products will make you healthier before you get pregnant.</detail><text>Also limit the amount of fish that you eat. Seafood contains mercury, which can cause birth defects if eaten in large amounts. Pregnant women should:</text><detail>Eat no more than 12 ounces (oz), or 340 g, of fish a week</detail><detail>Avoid large ocean fish, such as shark and tilefish.</detail><detail>Limit tuna intake to 1 can (85 g) of white tuna or 1 tuna steak per week, or 2 cans (170 g) of light tuna per week.</detail><text>If you are underweight or overweight, it is best to try to reach your ideal weight before you get pregnant.</text><detail>Being overweight during pregnancy may increase your chances of problems, such as high blood pressure, diabetes, miscarriage, stillbirth, birth defects, and needing a cesarean birth (C-section).</detail><detail>It is not a good idea to try to lose weight during pregnancy. But it is very good idea to attain a healthy pregnancy body weight before conceiving.</detail></h2><h2 title="Take Vitamins and Folic Acid"><text>Take a vitamin and mineral supplement that includes at least 0.4 milligrams (400 micrograms) of folic acid.</text><detail>Folic acid reduces the risk of birth defects, especially problems with the baby's spine.</detail><detail>Start taking a vitamin with folic acid before you want to get pregnant.</detail><detail>Avoid high doses of any vitamin, especially vitamins A, D, E, and K. These vitamins can cause birth defects if you take more than the normal recommended daily amounts. </detail></h2><h2 title="Exercise "><text>Exercising before you get pregnant may help your body deal with all of the changes that you will go through during the pregnancy and labor.</text><text>Most women who already exercise can safely maintain their current exercise program throughout the most of their pregnancy. </text><text>And most women, even if they are not currently exercising, should start on an exercise program of 30 minutes of brisk exercise 5 days per week, both before conceiving and throughout pregnancy.</text><text>The amount of exercise you are able to do during pregnancy should be based on your overall health and how active you are before you get pregnant. Talk to your doctor or midwife about what kind of exercise, and how much, is good for you.</text></h2><h2 title="Stress, Rest, and Relaxation"><text>While you are trying to get pregnant, try to relax and reduce stress as much as possible. Ask your doctor or midwife about techniques to reduce stress. Get plenty of rest and relaxation. This may make it easier for you to become pregnant.</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 4/19/2018"><text>Updated by: John D.

(This is how much you can bend and flex your joints). Tired, weak muscles add to the pain and stiffness of arthritis.</text></h2><h2 title="Choose From These Activities"><text>Stronger muscles also help you with balance to prevent falls. Being stronger can give you more energy, and help you lose weight and sleep better.</text><text>If you will be having surgery, exercising can help you stay strong, which will speed up your recovery. Water exercises may be the best exercise for your arthritis. Swimming laps, water aerobics, or even just walking in the shallow end of a pool all make the muscles around your spine and legs stronger.</text><text>Ask your health care provider if you can use a stationary bike. Be aware that if you have arthritis of the hip or knee cap, biking can worsen your symptoms.</text><text>If you are not able to do water exercises or use a stationary bike, try walking, as long as it does not cause too much pain. Walk on smooth, even surfaces, such as the sidewalks near your home or inside a shopping mall.</text><text>Ask your physical therapist or doctor to show you gentle exercises that will increase your range of motion and strengthen the muscles around your knees.</text><picname>Aging and exercise</picname><picurl>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/images/ency/fullsize/9309.jpg</picurl></h2><h2 title="Be Careful"><text>As long as you do not overdo it, staying active and getting exercise will not make your arthritis get worse faster.</text><text>Taking acetaminophen (such as Tylenol) or another pain medicine before you exercise is OK.

<item><title>Staph infections - self-care at home</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000686.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>Staph (pronounced staff) is short for Staphylococcus. Staph is a type of germ (bacteria) that can cause infections almost anywhere in the body.</text><text>One type of staph germ, called methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), is harder to treat. This is because MRSA is not killed by certain medicines used to treat other staph germs.</text></h2><h2 title="How Does Staph Spread?"><text>Many healthy people normally have staph on their skin, in their noses, or other body areas. Most of the time, the germ does not cause an infection or symptoms. This is called being colonized with staph. These persons are known as carriers. They can spread staph to others. Some people colonized by staph develop an actual staph infection that makes them sick.</text><text>Most staph germs are spread by skin-to-skin contact. They can also be spread when you touch something that has the staph germ on it, such as clothing or a towel. Staph germs can then enter a break in the skin, such as cuts, scratches, or pimples. Usually the infection is minor and stays in the skin. But the infection can spread deeper and affect the blood, bones, or joints. Organs such as the lungs, heart, or brain can also be affected. Serious cases can be life-threatening.</text></h2><h2 title="What are the Risk Factors for Staph Infection?"><text>You are more likely to get a staph infection if you: </text><detail>Have an open cut or sore</detail><detail>Inject illegal drugs</detail><detail>Have a medical tube such as urinary catheter or feeding tube</detail><detail>Have a medical device inside your body such as an artificial joint</detail><detail>Have a weakened immune system or ongoing (chronic) illness</detail><detail>Live with or have close contact with a person who has staph</detail><detail>Play contact sports or share athletic equipment</detail><detail>Share items such as towels, razors, or cosmetics with others</detail><detail>Recently stayed in a hospital or long-term care facility </detail></h2><h2 title="How Do You Know If You Have a Staph Infection?

With a serious infection, such as toxic shock syndrome, you may have a high fever, nausea and vomiting, and a sunburn-like rash.</text><text>The only way to know for sure if you have a staph infection is by seeing a health care provider.</text><detail>A cotton swab is used to collect a sample from an open skin rash or skin sore.</detail><detail>A blood, urine, or sputum sample may also be collected.</detail><detail>The sample is sent to a lab to test for staph. If staph is found, it will be tested to see which antibiotic should be used to treat your infection. </detail></h2><h2 title="Treatment"><text>If test results show you have a staph infection, treatment may include:</text><detail>Taking antibiotics</detail><detail>Cleaning and draining the wound</detail><detail>Surgery to remove an infected device</detail></h2><h2 title="Preventing Staph Infection"><text>Follow these steps to avoid a staph infection and prevent it from spreading.</text><detail>Keep your hands clean by washing them thoroughly with soap and water.

<item><title>Spitting up - self-care</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000754.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>Spitting up is common with babies. Babies may spit up when they burp or with their drool. Spitting up should not cause your baby any distress. Most often babies stop spitting up when they are about 7 to 12 months old.</text></h2><h2 title="Why Babies Spit up "><text>Your baby is spitting up because:</text><detail>The muscle at the top of your baby's stomach may not be fully developed. So baby's stomach cannot hold in milk.</detail><detail>The valve at the bottom of the stomach may be too tight. So the stomach gets too full and milk comes out.</detail><detail>Your baby may drink too much milk too fast, and take in a lot of air in the process. These air bubbles fill up the stomach and milk comes out.</detail><detail>Overfeeding causes your baby to get too full. So milk comes up.</detail><text>Spitting up is often not due to a formula intolerance or an allergy to something in the nursing mother's diet.</text></h2><h2 title="Spitting up is Often Normal"><text>If your baby is healthy, happy, and growing well, you don't need to worry. Babies that are growing well often gain at least 6 ounces (170 grams) a week and have wet diapers at least every 6 hours.</text></h2><h2 title="How to Reduce Spitting up"><text>To reduce spitting up you can:</text><detail>Burp your baby several times during and after feeding. To do so sit the baby upright with your hand supporting the head. Let the baby lean forward slightly, bending at the waist. Gently pat your baby's back. (Burping your baby over your shoulder puts pressure on the stomach. This might cause more spitting up.)</detail><detail>Try nursing with just one breast per feeding while breastfeeding.</detail><detail>Feed smaller amounts of formula more frequently. Avoid large amounts at one time. Be sure that the hole in the nipple is not too large while bottle feeding.</detail><detail>Hold your baby upright for 15 to 30 minutes after feeding.</detail><detail>Avoid a lot of movement during and immediately after feeding.</detail><detail>Slightly elevate the head of babies' cribs so babies can sleep with their heads slightly up.</detail><detail>Talk to your baby's health care provider about trying a different formula or removing certain foods from the mother's diet (often cow's milk). </detail></h2><h2 title="When to Call the Doctor"><text>If your baby's spit up is forceful, call your baby's provider. You want to make sure your baby does not have pyloric stenosis, a problem where the valve at the bottom of the stomach is too tight and needs to be fixed.</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 8/31/2016"><text>Updated by: Neil K.

<item><title>Spine surgery - discharge</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000313.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>You were in the hospital for spine surgery. You probably had a problem with one or more disks. A disk is a cushion that separates the bones in your spine (vertebrae).</text><text>Now that you're going home, follow the surgeon's instructions on how to care for yourself at home.</text></h2><h2 title="When You're in the Hospital"><text>You may have had one of these surgeries:</text><detail>Diskectomy -- surgery to remove all or part of your disk</detail><detail>Foraminotomy -- surgery to widen the opening in your back where nerve roots leave your spinal column</detail><detail>Laminectomy -- surgery to remove the lamina, two small bones that make up a vertebra, or bone spurs in your back, to take pressure off your spinal nerves or spinal column</detail><detail>Spinal fusion -- the fusing of two bones together in your back to correct problems in your spine </detail></h2><h2 title="What to Expect at Home"><text>Recovery after diskectomy is usually quick.</text><text>After a diskectomy or foraminotomy, you may still feel pain, numbness, or weakness along the path of the nerve that was under pressure. These symptoms should get better in a few weeks.</text><text>Recovery after laminectomy and fusion surgery is longer. You will not be able to return to activities as quickly. It takes at least 3 to 4 months after surgery for bones to heal well, and healing may continue for at least a year.</text><text>If you had spinal fusion, you will probably be off work for 4 to 6 weeks if you are young and healthy and your job is not very strenuous. It may take 4 to 6 months for older people with more extensive surgery to get back to work.</text><text>Length of recovery also depends on how bad your condition was before surgery.</text></h2><h2 title="Wound Care"><text>Your bandages (or tape) may fall off within 7 to 10 days. If not, you may remove them yourself if your surgeon says it's OK.</text><text>You may feel numbness or pain around your incision, and it may look a little red. Check it every day to see if it:</text><detail>Is more red, swollen, or draining extra fluid</detail><detail>Feels warm</detail><detail>Begins to open up </detail><text>If any of these occur, call your surgeon. </text><text>Check with your surgeon about when you can shower again. You may be told the following:</text><detail>Make sure your bathroom is safe.</detail><detail>Keep the incision dry for the first 5 to 7 days.</detail><detail>The first time you shower, have someone help you.</detail><detail>Cover the incision with plastic wrap.</detail><detail>DO NOT allow water from the shower head to spray the incision. </detail><text>DO NOT smoke or use tobacco products after spine surgery. Avoiding tobacco is even more important if you had a fusion or graft. Smoking and using tobacco products slows the healing process.</text></h2><h2 title="Activity"><text>You will need to change how you do some things. Try not to sit for longer than 20 or 30 minutes at one time. Sleep in any position that does not cause back pain. Your surgeon will tell you when you can resume sex.</text><text>You may be fitted for a back brace or corset to help support your back:</text><detail>Wear the brace when you are sitting or walking.</detail><detail>You do not need to wear the brace when you are sitting on the side of the bed for a short time or use the bathroom at night. </detail><text>DO NOT bend at the waist. Instead, bend your knees and squat down to pick up something. DO NOT lift or carry anything heavier than around 10 pounds or 4.5 kilograms (about 1 gallon or 4 liters of milk). This means you should not lift a laundry basket, grocery bags, or small children. You should also avoid lifting something above your head until your fusion heals.</text><text>Other activity:</text><detail>Take only short walks for the first 2 weeks after surgery. After that, you may slowly increase how far you walk.</detail><detail>You may go up or down stairs once a day for the first 1 or 2 weeks, if it does not cause much pain or discomfort.</detail><detail>DO NOT start swimming, golfing, running, or other more strenuous activities until you see your doctor. You should also avoid vacuuming and more strenuous household cleaning. </detail><text>Your surgeon may prescribe physical therapy so that you learn how to move and do activities in a way that prevents pain and keeps your back in a safe position. These may include how to:</text><detail>Get out of bed or up from a chair safely</detail><detail>Get dressed and undressed</detail><detail>Keep your back safe during other activities, including lifting and carrying items</detail><detail>Do exercises that strengthen your back muscles to keep your back stable and safe </detail><text>Your surgeon and physical therapist can help you decide whether or when you can return to your previous job.</text><text>Riding or driving in a car:</text><detail>DO NOT drive for the first 2 weeks after surgery. After 2 weeks, you may take short trips only if your surgeon says it's OK.</detail><detail>Travel only for short distances as a passenger in a car. If you have a long ride home from the hospital, stop every 30 to 45 minutes to stretch a bit. </detail></h2><h2 title="Pain Management"><text>Your surgeon will give you a prescription for pain medicines. Get it filled when you go home so you have it available. Take the medicine before the pain becomes very bad. If you will be doing an activity, take the medicine about half an hour before you start.</text></h2><h2 title="When to Call the Doctor"><text>Call your surgeon if you have any of the following:</text><detail>Chills or a fever of 101°F (38.3°C), or higher</detail><detail>More pain where you had your surgery</detail><detail>Drainage from the wound, or the drainage is green or yellow</detail><detail>Lose feeling or have a change of feeling in your arms (if you had neck surgery) or your legs and feet (if you had lower back surgery)</detail><detail>Chest pain, shortness of breath</detail><detail>Swelling</detail><detail>Calf pain</detail><detail>Your back pain worsens and does not get better with rest and pain medicine</detail><detail>Difficulty urinating and controlling your bowel movements </detail></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>Diskectomy - discharge; Foraminotomy - discharge; Laminectomy - discharge; Spinal fusion - discharge; Spinal microdiskectomy - discharge; Microdecompression - discharge; Laminotomy - discharge; Disk removal - discharge; Spine surgery - diskectomy - discharge; Intervertebral foramina - discharge; Spine surgery - foraminotomy - discharge; Lumbar decompression - discharge; Decompressive laminectomy - discharge; Spine surgery - laminectomy - discharge; Vertebral interbody fusion - discharge; Posterior spinal fusion - discharge; Arthrodesis - discharge; Anterior spinal fusion - discharge; Spine surgery - spinal fusion - discharge</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 3/9/2017"><text>Updated by: C.

<item><title>Snoring - adults</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000720.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>Snoring is a loud, hoarse, harsh breathing sound that occurs during sleep. Snoring is common in adults. </text><text>Loud, frequent snoring can make it hard for both you and your bed partner to get enough sleep. Sometimes snoring can be a sign of a sleep disorder called sleep apnea. </text></h2><h2 title="Causes"><text>When you sleep, the muscles in your throat relax and your tongue slips back in your mouth. Snoring occurs when something blocks air from flowing freely through your mouth and nose. When you breathe, the walls of your throat vibrate, causing the sound of snoring.</text><text>There are several factors that can lead to snoring, including:</text><detail>Being overweight. The extra tissue in your neck puts pressure on your airways.</detail><detail>Tissue swelling during the last month of pregnancy.</detail><detail>Crooked or bent nasal septum, which is the wall of bone and cartilage between your nostrils.</detail><detail>Growths in your nasal passages (nasal polyps).</detail><detail>Stuffy nose from a cold or allergies.</detail><detail>Swelling in the roof of your mouth (soft palate) or the uvula, the piece of tissue that hangs down in the back of your mouth. These areas may also be longer than normal.</detail><detail>Swollen adenoids and tonsils that block the airways. This is a common cause of snoring in children.</detail><detail>A tongue that is wider at the base, or a larger tongue in a smaller mouth.</detail><detail>Poor muscle tone. This may be caused by aging or by using sleeping pills, antihistamines, or alcohol at bedtime. </detail><text>Sometimes snoring can be a sign of a sleep disorder called sleep apnea. </text><detail>This occurs when you completely or partly stop breathing for more than 10 seconds while you sleep.</detail><detail>This is followed by a sudden snort or gasp when you start breathing again. During that time you wake up without realizing it.</detail><detail>Then you start to snore again.</detail><detail>This cycle usually happens many times a night, which makes it hard to sleep deeply. </detail><text>Sleep apnea can make it especially hard for your bed partner to get a good night's sleep.</text></h2><h2 title="Home Care"><text>To help reduce snoring:</text><detail>Avoid alcohol and medicines that make you sleepy at bedtime.</detail><detail>DO NOT sleep flat on your back. Try to sleep on your side instead. You can sew a golf or tennis ball into the back of your night clothes. If you roll over, the pressure of the ball will help remind you to stay on your side. Over time, side sleeping will become a habit.</detail><detail>Lose weight, if you are overweight.</detail><detail>Try over-the-counter, drug-free nasal strips that help widen the nostrils. (These are not treatments for sleep apnea.) </detail><text>If your health care provider has given you a breathing device, use it on a regular basis. Follow your provider's advice for treating allergy symptoms.</text></h2><h2 title="When to Call the Doctor"><text>Talk to your provider if you:</text><detail>Have problems with attention, concentration, or memory</detail><detail>Wake up in the morning not feeling rested</detail><detail>Feel very drowsy during the day</detail><detail>Have morning headaches</detail><detail>Gain weight</detail><detail>Tried self-care for snoring, and it has not helped </detail><text>You should also talk with your provider if you have episodes of no breathing (apnea) during the night. Your partner can tell you if you are snoring loudly or making choking and gasping sounds.</text><text>Depending on your symptoms and the cause of your snoring, your provider may refer you to a sleep specialist.</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 8/26/2017"><text>Updated by: Linda J.

<item><title>Snacks for adults</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000338.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>For almost anyone trying to watch their weight, choosing healthy snacks can be a challenge.</text><text>Even though snacking has developed a "bad image," snacks can be an important part of your diet.</text><text>They can provide energy in the middle of the day or when you exercise. A healthy snack between meals can also decrease your hunger and keep you from overeating at meal time.</text><text>There are many snacks to choose from, and certainly not all snacks are healthy or help you manage your weight. Try not to bring unhealthy snacks into the house. If they are not available you will not be able to snack mindlessly.</text></h2><h2 title="What Makes a Healthy Snack?"><text>If you are not sure if a snack is healthy, read the Nutrition Facts label. </text><text>Pay attention to the portion size given on the label. It is easy to eat more than this amount. Never eat straight from the bag, always portion out an appropriate serving and put the container away before you start snacking. Avoid snacks that list sugar as one the first few ingredients. Nuts are a healthy snack, but the portion size should be small and if you snack straight from the bag, it is very easy to eat too many calories.</text><text>Other factors to think about:</text><detail>The size of the snack should be the right size, a good balance between enough calories to satisfy you, but still not too many.</detail><detail>Pick foods that are low in added fat and sugar and high in fiber and water. This means an apple is better than a bag of chips.</detail><detail>Aim for fruits, vegetables, whole-grain snacks, and low-fat dairy.</detail><detail>Naturally sweetened is better than foods and drinks that contain added sugar.</detail><detail>Fresh fruit is a healthier choice than a fruit-flavored drink. Foods and drinks that list sugar or corn syrup as one of the first ingredients are not healthy snack choices.</detail><detail>Pairing protein and carbohydrate will help the snack to keep you fullest for the longest. Examples include having apple and string cheese, whole wheat crackers with peanut butter, carrots and hummus, or plain yogurt and fresh fruit. </detail></h2><h2 title="Healthy Snacks"><text>Fruits and vegetables are good choices for healthy snacks. They are full of vitamins and low in calories and fat. Some crackers and cheeses also make good snacks.</text><text>Some examples of healthy snack components are:</text><detail>Apples (dried or cut into wedges), 1 medium or ¼ cup (35 grams)</detail><detail>Bananas, 1 medium</detail><detail>Raisins, ¼ cup (35 grams)</detail><detail>Fruit leather (dried fruit puree) without added sugar</detail><detail>Carrots (regular carrots cut into strips, or baby carrots ), 1 cup (130 grams)</detail><detail>Snap peas (the pods are edible), 1.5 cups (350 grams)</detail><detail>Nuts (but not too many,) 1 oz.

Putting snacks in containers helps you eat the right size portion. Plan ahead and bring your own snacks to work.</text><text>Avoid junk-food snacks like chips, candy, cake, cookies, and ice cream. The best way to keep from eating junk food or other unhealthy snacks is to not have these foods in your house.</text><text>It is OK to have an unhealthy snack once in a while. Never allowing any unhealthy snacks or sweets may result in sneaking these foods. The key is balance and moderation.</text><text>Other tips:</text><detail>Replace the candy dish with a fruit bowl.</detail><detail>Store foods like cookies, chips, or ice cream where they are hard to see or reach. Put ice cream at the back of the freezer and chips on a high shelf. Move the healthier foods to the front, at eye level.</detail><detail>If your family snacks while watching TV, put a portion of the food in a bowl or on a plate for each person. It is easy to overeat straight from the package. </detail><text>If you are having a hard time finding healthy snacks that you want to eat, talk to a nutritionist or your family's health care provider for ideas that will work for your family.</text></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>Weight-loss - snacks; Healthy diet - snacks</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 8/14/2016"><text>Updated by: Emily Wax, RD, The Brooklyn Hospital Center, Brooklyn, NY.

DO NOT give up. Learning from your past tries can help you succeed.</text></h2><h2 title="There Are Many Reasons to Quit Smoking"><text>Tar, nicotine, and other chemicals from smoking can increase your risk of many health problems. These include heart and blood vessel problems, such as:</text><detail>Blood clots and aneurysms in the brain, which can lead to strokes</detail><detail>Coronary artery disease, including chest pain (angina) and heart attacks</detail><detail>High blood pressure</detail><detail>Poor blood supply to the legs</detail><detail>Problems with erections </detail><text>Smoking also increases your risk for different types of cancer, including cancer of the:</text><detail>Lungs</detail><detail>Mouth</detail><detail>Larynx</detail><detail>Esophagus</detail><detail>Bladder</detail><detail>Kidneys</detail><detail>Pancreas</detail><detail>Cervix </detail><text>Smoking also leads to lung problems, such as emphysema and chronic bronchitis, and makes asthma harder to control.</text><text>Some smokers switch to smokeless tobacco instead of quitting tobacco completely. But using smokeless tobacco still carries health risks, such as:</text><detail>Developing mouth or nasal cancer</detail><detail>Gum problems, tooth wear, and cavities</detail><detail>Worsening high blood pressure and chest pain </detail></h2><h2 title="How Smoking Affects Surgery"><text>Smokers who have surgery have a higher chance than nonsmokers of blood clots forming in their legs. These clots may travel to and damage the lungs. </text><text>Smoking decreases the amount of oxygen that reaches the cells in your surgical wound. As a result, your wound may heal more slowly and is more likely to become infected.</text><text>All smokers carry an increased risk for heart and lung problems. Even when your surgery goes smoothly, smoking causes your body, heart, and lungs to work harder than if you did not smoke.</text></h2><h2 title="Making the Decision to Quit"><text>Most doctors will tell you to stop using cigarettes and tobacco at least 4 weeks before your surgery. Stretching the time between quitting smoking and your surgery out to at least 10 weeks can decrease your risk of problems even more. Like any addiction, quitting tobacco is difficult. There are many ways to quit smoking and many resources to help you, such as:</text><detail>Family members, friends, and coworkers may be supportive or encouraging.</detail><detail>Talk to your doctor about medicines, such as nicotine replacement and prescription medicines.</detail><detail>If you join smoking cessation programs, you have a much better chance of success. Such programs are offered by hospitals, health departments, community centers, and work sites. </detail><text>Using nicotine gum around the time of surgery is not encouraged. The nicotine will still interfere with the healing of your surgical wound and have the same effect on your general health as using cigarettes and tobacco.</text></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>Surgery - quitting smoking; Surgery - quitting tobacco; Wound healing - smoking</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 9/17/2016"><text>Updated by: Debra G.

Smoking is also a trigger for COPD flare-ups. Smoking damages the air sacs, airways, and the lining of your lungs. Injured lungs have trouble moving enough air in and out, so it's hard to breathe.</text></h2><h2 title="Information"><text>Things that make COPD symptoms worse are called triggers. Knowing what your triggers are and how to avoid them can help you feel better. Smoking is a trigger for many people who have COPD.

Exposure to someone else's smoking (called secondhand smoke) is also a trigger for COPD flare-ups.</text><text>Smoking damages your lungs. When you have COPD and smoke, your lungs will get damaged more rapidly than if you were to stop smoking.</text></h2><h2 title="Quit Smoking"><text>Quitting smoking is the best thing you can do to protect your lungs and keep your COPD symptoms from getting worse.

<item><title>Sleep and your health</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000871.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>As life gets more hectic, it is all too easy to go without sleep. In fact, many Americans only get 6 hours of sleep a night or less. </text><text>You need ample sleep to help restore your brain and body. Not getting enough sleep can be bad for your health in a number of ways.</text></h2><h2 title="Why you Need Sleep"><text>Sleep gives your body and brain time to recover from the stresses of the day. After a good night's sleep, you perform better and are better at making decisions. Sleep can help you feel more alert, optimistic, and get along with people better. Sleep also helps your body ward off disease.</text></h2><h2 title="How Much Sleep do you Need"><text>Different people need different amounts of sleep. Most adults need 7 to 8 hours of sleep a night for good health and mental functioning. Some adults need up to 9 hours a night.</text></h2><h2 title="Why you Might not get Enough Sleep"><text>There are many reasons why sleep is in such short supply.</text><detail>Busy schedules. Evening activities, whether it is work or social, are one of the top reasons people do not get enough sleep.</detail><detail>Poor sleep environment. It is a lot harder to get a good night's sleep in a bedroom with too much noise or light, or that is either too cold or too warm.</detail><detail>Electronics. Tablets and cell phones that ring and beep throughout the night disrupt sleep. They can also make it impossible to disconnect from the waking world.</detail><detail>Medical conditions. Some health conditions can prevent deep sleep. These include arthritis, back pain, heart disease, and conditions such as asthma that make it hard to breathe. Depression, anxiety, and substance abuse also make sleep hard to come by. Some medicines disrupt sleep.</detail><detail>Stress about sleeping. After several nights of tossing and turning, just being in bed can make you anxious and awake, even when you are very tired. </detail><text>Sleep disorders</text><text>Sleep problems are a big reason why many people can't get enough sleep. Treatment can help in many cases.</text><detail>Insomnia, occurs when you have trouble falling asleep or sleeping through the night. It is the most common sleep disorder. Insomnia can last for a night, a couple of weeks, or for months on end.</detail><detail>Sleep apnea is a condition in which your breathing pauses throughout the night. Even if you do not wake up all the way, sleep apnea repeatedly interrupts deep sleep.</detail><detail>Restless legs syndrome can keep you awake with the desire to move your legs anytime you are resting. Often restless legs syndrome comes with uncomfortable feelings such as burning, tingling, itching, or creeping in your legs. </detail></h2><h2 title="Sleep and Safety"><text>Lack of sleep affects more than just the person who is short on shut-eye. Fatigue has been linked to accidents both large and small. Overtiredness led to the human errors behind several large disasters including the Exxon-Valdez oil spill and the Chernobyl nuclear accident. Poor sleep has contributed to numerous airplane crashes.</text><text>Each year, up to 100,000 car accidents and 1,550 deaths are caused by exhausted drivers. Drowsy driving impairs alertness and reaction time as much as driving while drunk.</text><text>Lack of sleep can also make it harder to stay safe on the job. It can lead to medical errors and industrial accidents. </text></h2><h2 title="Sleep and Your Health"><text>Without enough sleep, your brain struggles to perform basic functions. You may find it hard to concentrate or remember things. You may become moody and lash out at co-workers or people you love. </text><text>Just as your brain needs sleep to restore itself, so does your body does too. When you do not have enough sleep, your risk goes up for several illnesses.</text><detail>Diabetes. Your body does not do as well controlling blood sugar when you do not get enough sleep.</detail><detail>Heart disease. Lack of sleep can lead to high blood pressure and inflammation, two things that can damage your heart.</detail><detail>Obesity. When you do not get enough rest from sleep, you are more prone to overeat. It is also harder to resist foods high in sugar and fat.</detail><detail>Infection. Your immune system needs you to sleep so it can fight colds and keep you healthy.</detail><detail>Mental health. Depression and anxiety often make it hard to sleep. They also can become worse after a string of sleepless nights. </detail></h2><h2 title="When to Call the Doctor"><text>Talk with your health care provider if you are often tired during the day, or lack of sleep makes it hard to do daily activities.

This can be a lump, sore, or an area of skin that is not normal. It may also be a skin cancer or a noncancerous (benign) tumor.</text><text>You have had a skin lesion removal. This is a procedure to remove the lesion for examination by a pathologist or to prevent recurrence of the lesion.</text><text>You may have sutures or just a small open wound.</text><text>It is important to take care of the site. This helps prevent infection and allows the wound to heal properly.</text></h2><h2 title="How to Care for Stitches"><text>Stitches are special threads that are sewn through the skin at an injury site to bring the edges of a wound together. Care for your stitches and wound as follows:</text><detail>Keep the area dry for the first 48 hours after stitches have been placed.</detail><detail>Gently wash around the site with cool water and soap. Clean as close to the stitches as you can. Avoid washing or rubbing the stitches directly and avoid putting tension on the area.</detail><detail>Dry the site with a clean paper towel. Avoid using the towel directly on the stitches.</detail><detail>If there was a bandage over the stitches, replace it with a new clean bandage.</detail><detail>After 3 days, remove the bandage unless the health care provider told you otherwise. Allow the wound to be exposed to the open air.</detail><detail>Keep the site clean and dry by washing it 1 to 2 times daily.</detail><detail>Your provider should tell you when to come back to get the stitches removed. If not, contact your provider. </detail></h2><h2 title="How to Care for an Open Wound"><text>If your provider does not close your wound again with sutures, you need to care for it at home. The wound will heal from the bottom up to the top. </text><text>You may be asked to keep a dressing over the wound, or your provider may suggest leaving the wound open to air.</text><text>Keep the site clean and dry by washing it once a day. You will want to prevent a crust from forming or being pulled off. To do this:</text><detail>Your provider may suggest using petroleum jelly or an antibiotic ointment on the wound.</detail><detail>If there is a dressing and it sticks to the wound, wet it and try again, unless your provider instructed you to pull it off dry. </detail><text>DO NOT use skin cleansers, alcohol, peroxide, iodine, or soap with antibacterial chemicals. These can damage the wound tissue and slow healing.</text></h2><h2 title="After Cryotherapy"><text>The treated area may look red afterwards. A blister will often form within a few hours. It may appear clear or have a red or purple color.</text><text>You may have a little pain for up to 3 days.</text><text>Most of the time, no special care is needed during healing. The area should be washed gently once or twice a day and kept clean. A bandage or dressing should only be needed if the area rubs against clothes or may be easily injured.</text><text>A scab forms and will usually peel away within 1 to 3 weeks, depending on the area treated.</text></h2><h2 title="Important Tips"><text>The following tips may help:</text><detail>Prevent the wound from re-opening by keeping strenuous activity to a minimum.</detail><detail>Make sure your hands are clean when you care for the wound.</detail><detail>If the wound is on your scalp, it is OK to shampoo and wash. Be gentle and avoid a lot of exposure to water.</detail><detail>Take proper care of your wound to prevent further scarring.</detail><detail>You can take pain medicine, such as acetaminophen, as directed for pain at the wound site. Ask your provider about other pain medicines (such as aspirin or ibuprofen) to make sure they will not cause bleeding.</detail><detail>Follow-up with your provider to make sure the wound is healing properly.</detail></h2><h2 title="When to Call the Doctor"><text>Call your provider right away if:</text><detail>There is any redness, pain, or yellow pus around the injury. This could mean there is an infection.</detail><detail>There is bleeding at the injury site that will not stop after 10 minutes of direct pressure.</detail><detail>You have a fever greater than 100°F (37.8°C).</detail><detail>There is pain at the site that will not go away, even after taking pain medicine.</detail><detail>The wound has split open.</detail><detail>Your stitches or staples have come out too soon.</detail><text>After full healing has taken place, call your provider if the skin lesion does not appear to be gone.</text></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>Shave excision - skin aftercare; Excision of skin lesions - benign aftercare; Skin lesion removal - benign aftercare; Cryosurgery - skin aftercare; BCC - removal aftercare; Basal cell cancer - removal aftercare; Actinic keratosis - removal aftercare; Wart -removal aftercare; Squamous cell-removal aftercare; Mole - removal aftercare; Nevus - removal aftercare; Nevi - removal aftercare; Scissor excision aftercare; Skin tag removal aftercare; Mole removal aftercare; Skin cancer removal aftercare; Birthmark removal aftercare; Molluscum contagiosum - removal aftercare; Electrodesiccation - skin lesion removal aftercare </text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 5/24/2018"><text>Updated by: Kevin Berman, MD, PhD, Atlanta Center for Dermatologic Disease, Atlanta, GA.

This is called a free flap.</detail><text>Skin grafts are used to help more serious, larger and deeper wounds heal, including:</text><detail>Wounds that are too big to heal on their own</detail><detail>Burns</detail><detail>Skin loss from a serious skin infection</detail><detail>Surgery for skin cancer</detail><detail>Venous ulcers, pressure ulcers, or diabetic ulcers that DO NOT heal</detail><detail>After mastectomy or amputation</detail><text>The area from where skin is taken is called the donor site. After surgery, you will have two wounds, the graft or flap itself and the donor site. Donor sites for grafts and flaps are chosen based on:</text><detail>How closely the skin matches the area of the wound</detail><detail>How visible the scar will be from the donor site</detail><detail>How close the donor site is to the wound</detail><text>Often the donor site may be more painful after surgery than the wound due to newly exposed nerve endings.</text></h2><h2 title="Caring for Skin Flaps and Grafts"><text>You will need to care for the flap or graft site as well as the donor site. When you come home after surgery, you will have a dressing on your wounds. The dressing does several things, including:</text><detail>Protect your wound from germs and reduce the risk of infection</detail><detail>Protect the area as it heals</detail><detail>Soak up any fluids that leak from your wound </detail><text>To care for the graft or flap site:</text><detail>You may need to rest for several days after surgery as your wound heals.</detail><detail>The type of dressing you have depends on the type of wound and where it is.</detail><detail>Keep the dressing and area around it clean and free from dirt or sweat.</detail><detail>DO NOT let the dressing get wet.</detail><detail>DO NOT touch the dressing. Leave it in place for as long as your doctor recommends (about 4 to 7 days).</detail><detail>Take any medicines or pain relievers as directed.</detail><detail>If possible, try to elevate the wound so it is above your heart. This helps reduce swelling. You may need to do this while sitting or lying down. You can use pillows to prop up the area.</detail><detail>If your doctor says it is OK, you may use an ice pack on the bandage to help with swelling. Ask how often you should apply the ice pack. Be sure to keep the bandage dry.</detail><detail>Avoid any movement that might stretch or injure the flap or graft. Avoid hitting or bumping the area.</detail><detail>You will need to avoid strenuous exercise for several days. Ask your doctor for how long.</detail><detail>If you have a vacuum dressing, you may have a tube attached to the dressing. If the tube falls off, tell your doctor.</detail><detail>You will probably see your doctor to have your dressing changed in 4 to 7 days. You may need to have the dressing to your flap or graft site changed by your doctor a couple times over 2 to 3 weeks.</detail><detail>As the site heals, you may be able to care for it at home. Your doctor will show you how to care for your wound and apply dressings.</detail><detail>The site may become itchy as it heals. DO NOT scratch the wound or pick at it.</detail><detail>Apply SPF 30 or higher sunscreen to surgical sites if exposed to the sun. </detail><text>To care for the donor site:</text><detail>Leave the dressing in place. Keep it clean and dry.</detail><detail>Your doctor will remove the dressing in about 4 to 7 days, or give you instructions for how to remove it.</detail><detail>After the dressing is removed, you may be able to leave the wound uncovered. However, if it is in an area that is covered by clothing, you will want to cover the site to protect it. Ask your doctor what type of dressing to use.</detail><detail>DO NOT apply any lotions or creams to the wound unless your doctor tells you to. As the area heals, it may itch and scabs may form. DO NOT pick scabs or scratch the wound as it heals. </detail></h2><h2 title="Bathing or Showering"><text>Your doctor will let you know when it is OK to bathe after surgery. Keep in mind:</text><detail>You may need to take sponge baths for 2 to 3 weeks while your wounds are in the early stages of healing.</detail><detail>Once you get the OK to bathe, showers are better than baths because the wound does not soak in water. Soaking your wound could cause it to reopen.</detail><detail>Be sure to protect your dressings while you bathe to keep them dry. Your doctor may suggest covering the wound with a plastic bag to keep it dry.</detail><detail>If your doctor gives the OK, gently rinse your wound with water as you bathe. Do not rub or scrub the wound. Your doctor may recommend special cleansers to use on your wounds.</detail><detail>Gently pat dry the area around your wound with a clean towel. Let the wound air dry.</detail><detail>Do not use soaps, lotions, powders, cosmetics, or other skin care products on your wound unless told to do so by your doctor. </detail><text>At some point during the healing process, you will not need a dressing anymore. Your doctor will tell you when you can leave your wound uncovered and how to care for it.</text></h2><h2 title="When to Call the Doctor"><text>Call your doctor if:</text><detail>Pain gets worse or does not improve after taking pain relievers</detail><detail>You have bleeding that won't stop after 10 minutes with gentle, direct pressure</detail><detail>Your dressing comes loose</detail><detail>Edges of the graft or flap start to come up</detail><detail>You feel something bulging out of the graft or flap site </detail><text>Also call your doctor if you notice signs of an infection, such as: </text><detail>Increased drainage from the wound</detail><detail>Drainage becoming thick, tan, green, or yellow, or smells bad (pus)</detail><detail>Your temperature is above 100°F (37.8°C) for more than 4 hours</detail><detail>Red streaks appear that lead away from the wound </detail></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>Autograft - self-care; Skin transplant - self-care; Split-skin graft - self-care; Full thickness skin graft - self-care; Partial-dermal skin graft - self-care; FTSG - self-care; STSG - self-care; Local flaps - self-care; Regional flaps - self-care; Distant flaps - self-care; Free flap - self-care; Skin autografting - self-care; Pressure ulcer skin flap self-care; Burns skin flap self-care; Skin ulcer skin graft self-care</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 5/24/2018"><text>Updated by: Kevin Berman, MD, PhD, Atlanta Center for Dermatologic Disease, Atlanta, GA.

<item><title>Skin and hair changes during pregnancy</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000611.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>Most women have changes in their skin, hair, and nails during pregnancy. Most of these are normal and go away after pregnancy. </text></h2><h2 title="Stretch Marks"><text>Most pregnant women get stretch marks on their belly. Some also get stretch marks on their breasts, hips, and buttocks. Stretch marks on the belly and lower body appear as the baby grows. On the breasts, they appear as the breasts enlarge to prepare for breastfeeding.</text><text>During your pregnancy, your stretch marks may appear red, brown, or even purple. Once you deliver, they will fade and not be as noticeable.</text><text>Many lotions and oils claim to reduce stretch marks. These products may smell and feel good, but they cannot really prevent stretch marks from forming.</text><text>Avoiding excessive weight gain during pregnancy can minimize your risk of getting stretch marks.</text></h2><h2 title="Other Skin Changes"><text>Your changing hormone levels during pregnancy may have other effects on your skin.</text><detail>Some women get brownish or yellowish patches around their eyes and over their cheeks and nose. Sometimes, this is called the "mask of pregnancy." The medical term for it is chloasma.</detail><detail>Some women also get a dark line on the midline of their lower abdomen. This is called the linea nigra.</detail><text>To help prevent these changes, wear a hat and clothes that protect you from the sun and use a good sunblock. Sunlight can make these skin changes darker. Using concealer may be OK, but do not use anything that contains bleaches or other chemicals.</text><text>Most skin color changes fade within a few months after you give birth. Some women are left with freckles.</text></h2><h2 title="Your Nails and Hair"><text>

 
You may notice changes in the texture and growth of your hair and nails during pregnancy. Some women say that their hair and nails both grow faster and are stronger. Others say their hair falls out and their nails split after delivery. Most women lose some hair after delivery. In time, your hair and nails will return to the way they were before your pregnancy.
</text></h2><h2 title="Feeling Itchy During Pregnancy"><text>A small number of women develop an itchy rash during their 3rd trimester, most often after 34 weeks.</text><detail>You may have itchy red bumps, often in large patches.</detail><detail>The rash will often be on your belly, but it can spread to your thighs, buttocks, and arms.</detail><text>Lotions and creams may soothe the area, but do not use products that contain perfumes or other chemicals. These may cause your skin to react more.</text><text>To relieve rash symptoms, your health care provider may suggest or prescribe:</text><detail>An antihistamine, a medicine to relieve the itching (talk with your provider before taking this medicine on your own)</detail><detail>Steroid (corticosteroid) creams to apply on the rash</detail><text>This rash will not harm you or your baby, and it will disappear after you have your baby.</text></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>Dermatosis of pregnancy; Polymorphic eruption of pregnancy; Melasma - pregnancy; Prenatal skin changes</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 11/11/2016"><text>Updated by: Irina Burd, MD, PhD, Associate Professor of Gynecology and Obstetrics at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD.

<item><title>Simple, heart-smart substitutions</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000746.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>A heart-healthy diet is low in saturated fat. It also limits foods with added salt and added sugar.</text><text>Making heart-healthy food choices does not mean you have to sacrifice flavor. The key is to include more fresh produce, whole grains, beans, lean meats, fish, and low-fat dairy.</text></h2><h2 title="1. Replace Saturated Fats"><text>Reduce the amount of fat in your dairy. Whole-fat dairy products are high in saturated fat. But there are healthier options.</text><detail>Instead of butter, cook with olive, canola, corn, or safflower oils.</detail><detail>Replace heavy cream with evaporated skim milk.</detail><detail>Whole-milk cheese, yogurt, and milk with low-fat versions. </detail><text>Experiment. If a recipe calls for whole milk, you can usually replace most or all of the volume with skim or low-fat milk with no reduction in final quality.</text><text>Try meat substitutes with your meals.</text><detail>Beans are great in soups, salads, and over rice.</detail><detail>Nuts liven up salads, stir-fried meals, and vegetables.</detail><detail>Eggs make great dinners, as omelets and frittatas.</detail><detail>Mushrooms add a meaty texture to sauces, casseroles, and stroganoffs.</detail><detail>Tofu goes well with curries and stir fried dishes.</detail><detail>Eat more fish, especially fish that are high in omega-3 fatty acids. This includes herring, sardines, salmon, tuna, trout, and mackerel. </detail><text>Choose lean meats. They have less fat and are better for your heart. When selecting and cooking lean meats:</text><detail>Remove the skin from chicken and turkey before serving.</detail><detail>Choose lean cuts of pork, such as tenderloin or loin chops.</detail><detail>Look for beef cuts labeled "choice" or "select."</detail><detail>Avoid marbled cuts of beef, or cuts marked "prime."</detail><detail>Cut off visible fat before cooking.</detail><detail>Instead of frying, bake, roast, broil, or stir fry meat.</detail><detail>If excess fat pools in the pan, pour it off before serving the meat. </detail><text>Prepare meat as just a part of the meal, rather than the main attraction.

It is an injury to the top of the shoulder where the collarbone (clavicle) meets the top of the shoulder blade (acromion of the scapula).</text><text>It is not the same as a shoulder dislocation. A dislocated shoulder occurs when the arm bone comes out of the main shoulder joint.</text></h2><h2 title="About Your Injury"><text>Most shoulder separation injuries are caused by falling onto the shoulder. This results in a tear in the tissue that connects the collarbone and top of the shoulder blade. These tears can also come from car accidents and sports injuries.</text><text>This injury can make the shoulder look abnormal from the end of a bone sticking up or the shoulder hanging lower than normal. </text><text>Pain is usually at the very top of the shoulder.</text><text>Your health care provider may have you hold onto a weight while examining you to see if your collarbone sticks out. An x-ray of your shoulder may help diagnose a shoulder separation.</text></h2><h2 title="What to Expect"><text>Most people recover from a shoulder separation without surgery, within 2 to 12 weeks.

After the first day, ice the area every 3 to 4 hours for 20 minutes each time. Do this for 2 days or longer, or as instructed by your provider.</text><text>For pain, you can take ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn), aspirin, or acetaminophen (Tylenol).

The pain of shin splints is from the inflammation of the muscles, tendons, and bone tissue around your shin. Shin splints are a common problem for runners, gymnasts, dancers, and military recruits. However, there are things you can do to heal from shin splints and prevent them from getting worse.</text></h2><h2 title="Causes"><text>Shin splints are an exercise problem. You get shin splints from overloading your leg muscles, tendons or shin bone.</text><text>Shin splints happen from overuse with too much activity or an increase in training. Most often, the activity is high impact and repetitive exercise of your lower legs. This is why runners, dancers, and gymnasts often get shin splints. Common activities that cause shin splints are:</text><detail>Running, especially on hills. If you are a new runner, you are at greater risk for shin splints.</detail><detail>Increasing your days of training.</detail><detail>Increasing the intensity of training, or going a longer distance.</detail><detail>Doing exercise that has frequent stops and starts, such as dancing, basketball, or military training.</detail><text>You are more at risk for shin splints if you:</text><detail>Have flat feet or a very rigid foot arches.</detail><detail>Work out on hard surfaces, such as running on the street or playing basketball or tennis on a hard court.</detail><detail>Do not wear the proper shoes.</detail><detail>Wear worn out shoes.

Increase your activity level slowly. If the pain returns, stop exercising right away.</text><text>Know that shin splints can take 3 to 6 months to heal. DO NOT rush back into your sport or exercise. You could injure yourself again. </text></h2><h2 title="Reduce Your Pain and Swelling"><text>Things you can do to ease discomfort include:</text><detail>Ice your shins. Ice several times a day for 3 days or until pain is gone.</detail><detail>Do stretching exercises.</detail><detail>Take ibuprofen, naproxen, or aspirin to decrease swelling and to help with pain. Know these medicines have side effects and can cause ulcers and bleeding. Talk to your doctor about how much you can take.</detail><detail>Use arch supports. Talk with your doctor and physical therapist about wearing the proper shoes, and about special shock-absorbing insoles or orthotics to wear inside your shoes.</detail><detail>Work with a physical therapist. They can use therapies that may help with the pain. They can teach you exercises to strengthen your leg muscles. </detail></h2><h2 title="Prevent Shin Splints When Exercise Again"><text>To prevent shin splints from recurring:</text><detail>Be pain-free for at least 2 weeks before returning to your exercise routine.</detail><detail>DO NOT overdo your exercise routine. DO NOT return to your previous level of intensity. Go slower, for a shorter time.

<item><title>Septoplasty - discharge</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000246.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>Septoplasty is surgery to correct any problems in the nasal septum. The nasal septum is the wall inside the nose that separates the nostrils.</text></h2><h2 title="When You're in the Hospital"><text>You had septoplasty to fix the problems in your nasal septum. This surgery takes about 1 to 1 ½ hours. You may have received general anesthesia so you were asleep and pain free. You may only have had local anesthetic in the area having surgery but this is less likely.</text></h2><h2 title="What to Expect at Home"><text>After surgery, you may have either packaging (to stop bleeding) or splints (to hold the tissues in place) inside your nose. Most of the time, this packing is removed 24 to 36 hours after surgery. Splints may be left in place for as long as 1 to 2 weeks.</text><text>You may have swelling in your face for 2 to 3 days after surgery. Your nose may drain and bleed a little for 2 to 5 days after surgery.</text><text>Your nose, cheeks, and upper lip may be numb. The numbness on the tip of your nose may take several months to completely go away.</text></h2><h2 title="Self-care "><text>Rest all day after surgery. DO NOT touch or rub your nose. Avoid blowing your nose (it is normal to feel stuffed up for several weeks).</text><text>You may apply ice packs to your nose and eye area to help with pain and swelling, but make sure to keep your nose dry. Cover the ice pack with a clean, dry cloth or small towel. Sleeping propped up on 2 pillows will also help reduce swelling.</text><text>You will get a prescription for pain medicines. Get it filled when you go home so you have it when you need it. Take pain medicines, such as acetaminophen (Tylenol) or a prescription painkiller, the way you have been told to take them. Take your medicine when pain first starts. DO NOT let pain get very bad before taking it.</text><text>You should not drive, operate machinery, drink alcohol, or make any major decisions for at least 24 hours after surgery. Your anesthesia may make you groggy and it will be hard to think clearly. The effects should wear off in about 24 hours.</text><text>Limit activities that could make you fall or put more pressure on your face. Some of these are bending over, holding your breath, and tightening muscles during bowel movements. Avoid heavy lifting and hard physical activity for 1 to 2 weeks. You should be able to go back to work or school 1 week after surgery.</text><text>DO NOT take baths or showers for 24 hours. Your nurse will show you how to clean your nose area with Q-tips and hydrogen peroxide or another cleaning solution if needed.</text><text>You may go outside a few days after surgery, but DO NOT stay in the sun for more than 15 minutes.</text><text>Follow up with your provider as you have been told. You may need to have stitches removed. Your provider will want to check your healing.</text></h2><h2 title="When to Call the Doctor"><text>Call your health care provider if you have:</text><detail>Trouble breathing</detail><detail>A heavy nosebleed, and you cannot stop it</detail><detail>Pain that is getting worse, or pain that your pain medicines are not helping with</detail><detail>High fever and chills </detail><detail>Headaches</detail><detail>Disorientation</detail><detail>Neck stiffness</detail></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>Nasal septum repair; Submucus resection of the septum</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 1/15/2017"><text>Updated by: Ashutosh Kacker, MD, FACS,  Professor of Clinical Otolaryngology, Weill Cornell Medical College, and Attending Otolaryngologist, New York-Presbyterian Hospital, New York, NY.

Screen time is sedentary activity, meaning you are being physically inactive while sitting down. Very little energy is used during screen time.</text><text>Most American children spend about 3 hours a day watching TV.

<item><title>Savings account for health care costs</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000864.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>As health insurance changes, out-of-pocket costs continue to grow. With special savings accounts, you can set aside tax-exempt money for your health care expenses. This means you will pay no or reduced taxes on the money in the accounts.</text></h2><h2 title="Types of Accounts"><text>The following options may be available to you:</text><detail>Health Savings Account (HSA)</detail><detail>Medical Savings Account (MSA)</detail><detail>Flexible Spending Arrangement (FSA)</detail><detail>Health Reimbursement Arrangement (HRA) </detail><text>Your employer may provide these options, and some of them may be set up on your own. More people are using these accounts every year.</text><text>These accounts are approved or regulated by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The accounts differ based on how much money you can save and how the funds are used. </text></h2><h2 title="Health Savings Accounts (HSA)"><text>An HSA is a bank account you use to save money for medical expenses. The amount you can set aside changes from year to year. Some employers contribute money into your HSA as well. You can keep the money in the account for as long as you want. In 2018, the contribution limit was $3,450 for a single person.</text><text>A bank or insurance company usually holds the money for you. They are called HSA trustees, or custodians. Your employer may have information about them for you. If your employer manages the account, you may be able to have pre-tax dollars put into the account. If you open one yourself, you can deduct the expenses when you file your taxes.</text><text>With HSAs, you can:</text><detail>Claim a tax deduction on the savings</detail><detail>Earn tax-free interest</detail><detail>Deduct the qualified medical expenses you pay for</detail><detail>Transfer the HSA to a new employer or yourself if you change jobs</detail><text>Also, you can carry over unused funds into the next year. After age 65 years, you can take out the savings in your HSA for non-medical expenses, without penalty.</text><text>People in high deductible health plans (HDHP) qualify for an HSA. HDHPs have higher deductibles than other plans. To be considered an HDHP, your plan has to have deductibles that meet a certain dollar amount. For 2018, this amount is over $1,350 for a single person. The amount changes slightly every year.</text></h2><h2 title="Medical Savings Accounts (MSA)"><text>MSAs are accounts very much like HSAs. However, MSAs are for people who are self-employed and employees of small businesses (less than 50 employees), and their spouses. The amount you can set aside depends on your yearly income and health plan deductible.</text><text>Like an HSA, a bank or insurance company holds the savings. But with MSAs, either you or your employer can put money into the account, but not both in the same year.</text><text>With MSAs, you can:</text><detail>Claim a tax deduction on the savings</detail><detail>Earn tax-free interest</detail><detail>Deduct the qualified medical expenses you pay for</detail><detail>Transfer the MSA to a new employer or yourself if you change jobs </detail></h2><h2 title="Flexible Spending Arrangements (FSA)"><text>An FSA is a pre-tax savings account offered by an employer for any type of health plan. You can use the money to be reimbursed for medical expenses. Self-employed individuals cannot get an FSA. </text><text>With an FSA, you agree to have your employer put part of your pre-tax salary into an account. Your employer also may contribute to the account, and it is not part of your gross income.</text><text>You do not need to file tax documents for your FSA. When you take money out of the account for qualified medical expenses, it is tax free. Like a credit line, you can use the account before you have put funds in the account. </text><text>Any unused funds do not roll over to the next year. So you will lose any money you put into the account if you do not use it by the end of the year. You also cannot take an FSA with you if you change jobs. </text></h2><h2 title="Health Reimbursement Arrangement (HRA)"><text>An HRA is a simple arrangement offered by an employer for any type of health plan. It does not require a separate bank account and tax reporting. There is no tax advantage to this type of account.</text><text>Your employer funds an amount of their choosing and sets up the features of the arrangement. Your employer decides which out-of-pocket medical expenses qualify and offers reimbursement for those expenses when you use health care. HRAs can be set up for any type of health plan.</text><text>If you change jobs, the HRA funds do not move with you. Where HSAs are attached to you, HRAs are attached to the employer.</text></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>Health savings accounts; Flexible spending accounts; Medical savings accounts; Health reimbursement arrangements; HSA; MSA; Archer MSA; FSA; HRA</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 8/3/2018"><text>Updated by: Linda J.

<item><title>Sacroiliac joint pain - aftercare</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000610.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>The sacroiliac joint (SIJ) is a term used to describe the place where the sacrum and the iliac bones join.</text><detail>The sacrum is located at the base of your spine. It is made up of 5 vertebrae, or backbones, that are fused together.</detail><detail>The iliac bones are the two large bones that make up your pelvis. The sacrum sits in the middle of the iliac bones.</detail></h2><h2 title="More About Your Problem"><text>The main purpose of the SIJ is to connect the spine and the pelvis. As a result, there is very little movement at this joint. </text><text>Major reasons for pain around the SIJ include:</text><detail>Pregnancy. The pelvis widens to prepare for birth, stretching the ligaments (strong, flexible tissue that connects bone to bone).</detail><detail>Different types of arthritis.</detail><detail>Difference in leg lengths.</detail><detail>Wearing away of the cartilage (cushion) between the bones.</detail><detail>Trauma from impact, such as landing hard on buttocks.</detail><detail>History of pelvic fractures or injuries.</detail><detail>Muscle tightness. </detail><text>Although SIJ pain can be caused by trauma, this type of injury more often develops over a long period.</text></h2><h2 title="What to Expect"><text>Symptoms of SIJ dysfunction include:</text><detail>Pain in the lower back, usually only on one side</detail><detail>Hip pain</detail><detail>Discomfort with bending over or standing after sitting for long periods</detail><detail>Improvement in pain when lying down </detail><text>Your doctor may move your legs and hips around in different positions to help diagnose a SIJ dysfunction. You may also need to have x-rays or a CT scan. </text></h2><h2 title="Symptom Relief"><text>Follow these steps for the first few days or weeks after your injury or when starting treatment for SIJ pain:</text><detail>Rest. Keep activity to a minimum and stop movements or activity that worsen the pain.</detail><detail>Ice your lower back or upper buttocks for about 20 minutes 2 to 3 times a day. DO NOT apply ice directly to the skin.</detail><detail>Use a heating pad on the low setting to help loosen tight muscles and relieve soreness.</detail><detail>Massage the muscles in the lower back, buttocks, and thigh.</detail><detail>Take pain medicines. </detail><text>For pain, you can use ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn), or acetaminophen (Tylenol). You can buy these medicines at the store without a prescription.</text><detail>Talk with your health care provider before using these medicines if you have heart disease, high blood pressure, kidney disease, or have had stomach ulcers or internal bleeding in the past.</detail><detail>DO NOT take more than the amount recommended on the bottle or by your provider. </detail><text>If this is a chronic problem, your doctor may prescribe an injection to help with pain and inflammation. The injection can be repeated over time if needed.</text></h2><h2 title="Activity"><text>Keep activity to a minimum. The more time the injury has rest, the better. For support during activity, you can use a sacroiliac belt or lumbar brace.</text><text>Physical therapy is an important part of the healing process. It will help relieve pain and increase strength. Talk to your doctor or physical therapist for exercises to practice.</text><text>Here is an example of an exercise for your lower back:</text><detail>Lie flat on your back with your knees bent and feet flat on the ground.</detail><detail>Slowly, begin to rotate your knees to the right side of your body. Stop when you feel pain or discomfort.</detail><detail>Slowly rotate back toward the left side of your body until you feel pain.</detail><detail>Rest in the starting position.</detail><detail>Repeat 10 times. </detail><text>The best way to get rid of SIJ pain is to stick to a care plan. The more you rest, ice, and do exercises, the quicker your symptoms will improve or your injury will heal. </text></h2><h2 title="Follow-up"><text>Your doctor may need to follow up if the pain is not going away as expected. You may need:</text><detail>X-ray and imaging tests </detail><detail>Blood tests to help diagnose the cause </detail></h2><h2 title="When to Call the Doctor"><text>Call the doctor if you have any of the following:</text><detail>Sudden numbness or tingling in your lower back and hips</detail><detail>Weakness or numbness in your legs</detail><detail>Have problems controlling of your bowel or bladder</detail><detail>Sudden increase in pain or discomfort</detail><detail>Slower than expected healing</detail><detail>Fever </detail></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>SIJ pain - aftercare; SIJ dysfunction - aftercare; SIJ strain - aftercare; SIJ subluxation - aftercare; SIJ syndrome - aftercare; SI joint - aftercare</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 11/27/2016"><text>Updated by: C.

<item><title>Types of hormone therapy</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000695.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>Hormone therapy (HT) uses one or more hormones to treat symptoms of menopause. HT uses estrogen, progestin (a type of progesterone), or both. Sometimes testosterone is also added. </text></h2><h2 title="Menopause and Hormones"><text>Menopause symptoms include:</text><detail>Hot flashes</detail><detail>Night sweats</detail><detail>Sleep problems</detail><detail>Vaginal dryness</detail><detail>Anxiety</detail><detail>Moodiness</detail><detail>Less interest in sex </detail><text>After menopause, your body stops making estrogen and progesterone. HT can treat menopause symptoms that bother you.</text><text>HT does have some risks. It may increase your risk for:</text><detail>Blood clots</detail><detail>Breast cancer</detail><detail>Heart disease</detail><detail>Stroke </detail><text>Despite these concerns, for many women, HT is a safe way to treat menopause symptoms. </text><text>Currently, experts are unclear on how long you should take HT. Some professional groups suggest that you can take HT for menopause symptoms for longer periods if there is not medical reason to discontinue the medication. For many women, low doses of HT may be enough to control troublesome symptoms. Low doses of HT tend to have few side effects. These are all issues to discuss with your health care provider.</text></h2><h2 title="Forms of Hormone Therapy"><text>HT comes in different forms. You may need to try different types before finding one that works best for you.</text><text>Estrogen comes in:</text><detail>Nasal spray</detail><detail>Pills or tablets, taken by mouth</detail><detail>Skin gel</detail><detail>Skin patches, applied to the thigh or belly</detail><detail>Vaginal creams or vaginal tablets to help with dryness and pain with sexual intercourse</detail><detail>Vaginal ring</detail><text>Most women who take estrogen and who still have their uterus also need to take progestin. Taking both hormones together lowers the risk of endometrial (uterine) cancer. Women who have had their uterus removed cannot get endometrial cancer. So, estrogen alone is recommended for them.</text><text>Progesterone or progestin comes in:</text><detail>Pills</detail><detail>Skin patches</detail><detail>Vaginal creams</detail><detail>Vaginal suppositories</detail><text>The type of HT your doctor prescribes may depend on what menopause symptoms you have. For example, pills or patches can treat night sweats. Vaginal rings, creams, or tablets help relieve vaginal dryness.</text><text>Discuss the benefits and risks of HT with your provider.</text></h2><h2 title="How you Will Take Hormones"><text>When taking estrogen and progesterone together, your doctor may suggest one of the following schedules:</text><text>Cyclic hormone therapy is often recommended when you start menopause.</text><detail>You take estrogen as a pill or use it in patch form for 25 days.</detail><detail>Progestin is added between days 10 and 14.</detail><detail>You use estrogen and progestin together for the remainder of the 25 days.</detail><detail>You don't take any hormones for 3 to 5 days.</detail><detail>You may have some monthly bleeding with cyclic therapy. </detail><text>Combined therapy is when you take estrogen and progestin together every day.</text><detail>You may have some unusual bleeding when starting or switching to this HT schedule.</detail><detail>Most women stop bleeding within 1 year. </detail><text>Your doctor may prescribe other medicines if you have severe symptoms or have a high risk of osteoporosis. For example, you may also take testosterone, a male hormone, to improve your sex drive.</text></h2><h2 title="Side Effects of Hormone Therapy"><text>HT can have side effects, including:</text><detail>Bloating</detail><detail>Breast soreness</detail><detail>Headaches</detail><detail>Mood swings</detail><detail>Nausea</detail><detail>Water retention</detail><detail>Irregular bleeding </detail><text>Tell your doctor if you notice side effects. Changing the dose or type of HT you take may help reduce these side effects. DO NOT change your dose or stop taking HT before talking with your doctor.</text></h2><h2 title="When to Call the Doctor"><text>If you have vaginal bleeding or other unusual symptoms during HT, call your doctor.</text><text>Be sure to continue seeing your doctor for regular checkups when taking HT.</text></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>HRT- types; Estrogen replacement therapy - types; ERT- types of hormone therapy; Hormone replacement therapy - types; Menopause - types of hormone therapy; HT - types; Menopausal hormone types</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 1/14/2018"><text>Updated by: John D.

Chemotherapy kills cancer cells. It may be used to cure cancer, help keep it from spreading, or reduce symptoms. </text><text>In some cases, people are treated with a single type of chemotherapy. But often, people get more than one type of chemotherapy at a time. This helps attack the cancer in different ways. </text><text>Targeted therapy and immunotherapy are other cancer treatments that use medicine to treat cancer.</text><text>Standard chemotherapy works by killing cancer cells and some normal cells.

Others divide to repair damage in the body. Cancer occurs when something causes cells to divide and grow out of control. They keep growing to form a mass of cells, or tumor. </text><text>Chemotherapy attacks dividing cells. This means that it is more likely to kill cancer cells than normal cells. Some types of chemotherapy damage the genetic material inside the cell that tells it how to copy or repair itself. Others types block chemicals the cell needs to divide. </text><text>Some normal cells in the body divide often, such as hair and skin cells. These cells also may be killed by chemo. That is why it can cause side effects like hair loss.

<item><title>Type 2 diabetes - self-care</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000328.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>Type 2 diabetes is a life-long (chronic) disease. If you have type 2 diabetes, your body has trouble using the insulin it normally makes. Insulin is a hormone made by the pancreas to control blood sugar. When your body's insulin isn't used correctly, the sugar from food stays in the blood and the sugar (glucose) level can get too high.</text><text>Most people with type 2 diabetes are overweight when they're diagnosed. The changes in the way the body handles blood sugar that lead to type 2 diabetes usually happens slowly.</text><text>Everyone with diabetes should receive proper education and support about the best ways to manage their diabetes. Ask your health care provider about seeing a diabetes educator.</text></h2><h2 title="Symptoms of Type 2 Diabetes"><text>You may not have any symptoms. If you do have symptoms, they may include:</text><detail>Hunger</detail><detail>Thirst</detail><detail>Urinating a lot, getting up more often than usual at night to urinate</detail><detail>Blurry vision</detail><detail>Infections</detail><detail>Trouble having an erection</detail><detail>Red skin rashes in parts of your body </detail><detail>Tingling or loss of sensation in your feet</detail></h2><h2 title="Take Control of Your Diabetes "><text>You should have good control of your blood sugar. If your blood sugar is not controlled, serious problems called complications can happen to your body after many years.</text><text>Learn the basic steps for managing diabetes to stay as healthy as possible. Doing so will help keep the complications of diabetes away. Steps include: </text><detail>Checking your blood sugar at home</detail><detail>Keeping a healthy diet</detail><detail>Being physically active</detail><text>Also, be sure to take any medicine or insulin as instructed. </text><text>Your provider will also help you by ordering blood tests and other tests. These help make sure your blood sugar and cholesterol levels are each in a healthy range. Also, follow your provider's instructions about keeping your blood pressure in a healthy range. </text><text>Your doctor will likely ask you to visit other providers to help you control your diabetes. These providers include a: </text><detail>Dietitian</detail><detail>Diabetes pharmacist</detail><detail>Diabetes educator </detail></h2><h2 title="Eat Healthy Foods and Manage Your Weight"><text>Foods with sugar and carbohydrates can raise your blood sugar too high. Alcohol and other drinks with sugar can also raise your blood sugar. A nurse or dietitian can teach you about good food choices.</text><text>Make sure you know how to have a balanced meal with protein and fiber. Eat healthy, fresh foods as much as possible. Don't eat too much food at one sitting. This helps keep your blood sugar in a good range.</text><text>Managing your weight and keeping a well-balanced diet are important. Some people with type 2 diabetes can stop taking medicines after losing weight (even though they still have diabetes). Your provider can let you know a good weight range for you.</text><text>Weight-loss surgery may be an option if you are obese and your diabetes is not under control. Your doctor can tell you more about this.</text></h2><h2 title="Exercise"><text>Regular exercise is good for people with diabetes. It lowers blood sugar. Exercise also: </text><detail>Improves blood flow</detail><detail>Lowers blood pressure </detail><text>It helps burn extra fat so that you can keep your weight down. Exercise can even help you handle stress and improves your mood.</text><text>Try walking, jogging, or biking for 30 to 60 minutes every day. Pick an activity that you enjoy and you are more likely to stick with. Bring food or juice with you in case your blood sugar gets too low. Drink extra water. Try to avoid sitting for more than 30 minutes at any one time.</text><text>Wear a diabetes ID bracelet. In case of an emergency, people know you have diabetes and can help you get the right medical attention.</text><text>Always check with your provider before beginning an exercise program. Your provider can help you choose an exercise program that is safe for you.</text></h2><h2 title="Check Your Blood Sugar"><text>You may be asked to check your blood sugar at home. This will tell you and your provider how well your diet, exercise, and medicines are working. A device called a glucose meter can provide an accurate blood sugar reading.</text><text>A doctor, nurse, or diabetes educator will help set up a home testing schedule for you. Your doctor will help you set your blood sugar goals.</text><detail>Many people with type 2 diabetes need to check their blood sugar only once or twice a day. Some people need to check more often.</detail><detail>If your blood sugar is in control, you may need to check your blood sugar only a few times a week. </detail></h2><h2 title="You May Need Medicines"><text>If diet and exercise are not enough, you may need to take medicine. It will help keep your blood sugar in a healthy range.</text><text>There are many diabetes medicines that work in different ways to help control your blood sugar. Many people with type 2 diabetes need to take more than one medicine to control their blood sugar. You may take medicines by mouth or as a shot (injection). Certain diabetes medicines may not be safe if you are pregnant. So, talk to your doctor about your medicines if you're thinking of becoming pregnant.</text><text>If medicines don't help you control your blood sugar, you may need to take insulin. Insulin must be injected under the skin. You'll receive special training to learn how to give yourself injections. Most people find that insulin injections are easier than they thought.</text></h2><h2 title="Learn to Prevent Long-term Problems of Diabetes"><text>People with diabetes have a high chance of getting high blood pressure and high cholesterol. You may be asked to take medicine to prevent or treat these conditions. Medicines may include:</text><detail>An ACE inhibitor or another medicine called an ARB for high blood pressure or kidney problems.</detail><detail>A medicine called a statin to keep your cholesterol low.</detail><detail>Aspirin to keep your heart healthy.</detail><text>DO NOT smoke. Smoking makes diabetes worse. If you do smoke, work with your provider to find a way to quit.</text><text>Diabetes can cause foot problems. You may get sores or infections. To keep your feet healthy:</text><detail>Check and care for your feet every day.</detail><detail>Make sure you're wearing the right kind of socks and shoes. Check your shoes and socks daily for any worn spots, which could lead to sores or ulcerations.</detail></h2><h2 title="See Your Doctor Regularly"><text>If you have diabetes, you should see your provider every 3 months, or as often as instructed. At these visits, your provider may:</text><detail>Ask about your blood sugar level</detail><detail>Check your blood pressure</detail><detail>Check the feeling in your feet</detail><detail>Check the skin and bones of your feet and legs</detail><detail>Examine the back of your eyes </detail><text>Your provider will also order blood and urine tests to make sure your:</text><detail>Kidneys are working well (every year)</detail><detail>Cholesterol and triglyceride levels are healthy (every year)</detail><detail>A1C level is in a good range for you (every 6 months if your diabetes is well controlled or every 3 months if it is not) </detail><text>Talk to your provider about any vaccines you may need, such as the yearly flu shot and the hepatitis B and pneumonia shots.</text><text>Visit the dentist every 6 months.

<item><title>Tubal ligation - discharge </title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000288.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>You had tubal ligation (or tying the tubes) surgery to close your fallopian tubes. These tubes connect the ovaries to the uterus. After tubal ligation a woman is sterile. In general, this means a woman can no longer get pregnant. However, there is still a small risk of pregnancy even after tubal ligation. (A similar procedure that removes the entire tube has a higher success rate in preventing pregnancy.) </text><text>Your surgeon probably made 1 or 2 small cuts in the area around your belly button. Then your surgeon inserted a laparoscope (a narrow tube with a tiny camera on the end) and other instruments into your pelvic area. Your tubes were either cauterized (burned shut) or clamped off with a small clip, a ring, or rubber bands.</text></h2><h2 title="What to Expect at Home"><text>You may have many symptoms that last 2 to 4 days. As long as they are not severe, these symptoms are normal:</text><detail>Shoulder pain</detail><detail>Scratchy or sore throat</detail><detail>Swollen belly (bloated) and crampy</detail><detail>Some discharge or bleeding from your vagina</detail><text>You should be able to do most of your normal activities after 2 or 3 days. But, you should avoid heavy lifting for 3 weeks.</text></h2><h2 title="Self-care"><text>Follow these self-care steps after your procedure:</text><detail>Keep your incision areas clean, dry, and covered. Change your dressings (bandages) as your health care provider told you to.</detail><detail>DO NOT take baths, soak in a hot tub, or go swimming until your skin has healed.</detail><detail>Avoid heavy exercise for several days after the procedure. Try not to lift anything heavier than 10 pounds (about a gallon, 5 kg, jug of milk).</detail><detail>You can have sexual intercourse as soon as you feel ready. For most women, this is usually within a week.</detail><detail>You may be able to return to work within a few days.</detail><detail>You may eat your normal foods. If you feel sick to your stomach, try dry toast or crackers with tea. </detail></h2><h2 title="When to Call the Doctor"><text>Call your provider if you have:</text><detail>Severe belly pain, or the pain you are having is getting worse and does not get better with pain medicines</detail><detail>Heavy bleeding from your vagina on the first day, or your bleeding does not lessen after the first day</detail><detail>Fever higher than 100.5°F (38°C) or chills</detail><detail>Pain, shortness of breath, feeling faint</detail><detail>Nausea or vomiting </detail><text>Also call your provider if your incisions are red or swollen, become painful, or there is a discharge coming from them.</text></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>Sterilization surgery - female - discharge; Tubal sterilization - discharge; Tube tying - discharge; Tying the tubes - discharge; Contraception - tubal</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 4/19/2018"><text>Updated by: John D.

<item><title>Trochanteric bursitis</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000777.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>A bursa is a fluid-filled sac that acts as a cushion between muscles, tendons, bone, and joints. Bursitis is the swelling and irritation of a bursa. The bursa that covers the outside of your hip is called the greater trochanter bursa.</text><text>Trochanteric bursitis occurs when the bursa in your hip becomes swollen and irritated. This is a common cause of hip pain.</text></h2><h2 title="Causes"><text>Trochanteric bursitis can be caused by:</text><detail>Overuse or stress on the hip from exercising or standing for long periods</detail><detail>Hip injury, such as from a fall</detail><detail>Having one leg that is longer than the other</detail><detail>Bone spurs on the hip</detail><detail>Spine problems, including scoliosis and arthritis of the spine</detail><detail>Muscle imbalance that puts more stress around the hip muscles</detail><detail>Infection (rare) </detail><text>Certain health problems can also cause hip bursitis, including:</text><detail>Rheumatoid arthritis</detail><detail>Gout</detail><detail>Pseudogout</detail><detail>Diabetes</detail><detail>Thyroid disease </detail><text>Bursitis is more common in older adults. Being out of shape or overweight may put you at greater risk for hip bursitis.</text></h2><h2 title="Symptoms"><text>Common symptoms include:</text><detail>Pain at the side of the hip, which may also be felt on the outside of the thigh</detail><detail>Pain that is sharp or intense at first, but may become more of an ache</detail><detail>Difficulty walking</detail><detail>Joint stiffness</detail><detail>Swelling and warmth of the hip joint</detail><detail>Catching and clicking sensation </detail><text>You may notice the pain more when:</text><detail>Getting out of a chair or bed</detail><detail>Sitting for a long time</detail><detail>Walking up stairs</detail><detail>Sleeping or lying on the affected side </detail></h2><h2 title="Tests and Exams"><text>Your doctor will do a physical exam and ask about your symptoms.</text><text>To rule out other conditions that could be causing your symptoms, you may have tests such as:</text><detail>X-rays</detail><detail>Ultrasound</detail><detail>MRI</detail></h2><h2 title="Treatment"><text>Many cases of hip pain go away with rest and self-care. Try these tips:</text><detail>Use an ice pack 3 to 4 times a day for the first 2 or 3 days.</detail><detail>Take pain relievers such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) or naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn) to help relieve pain and swelling.</detail><detail>Avoid activities that make the pain worse.</detail><detail>When sleeping, do not lie on the side that has bursitis.</detail><detail>Avoid standing for long periods of time.</detail><detail>When standing, stand on a soft, cushioned surface. Put an equal amount of weight on each leg.</detail><detail>Placing a pillow between your knees when lying on your side can help decrease your pain.</detail><detail>Wear comfortable, well-cushioned shoes with a low heel.</detail><detail>Lose weight if you are overweight.</detail><detail>Strengthen your core muscles. </detail><text>As the pain goes away, your health care provider may suggest exercises to build strength and prevent muscle atrophy. You may need physical therapy if you have trouble moving the joint.</text><text>Other treatments include:</text><detail>Removing fluid from the bursa</detail><detail>Steroid injection </detail><text>If none of the treatments work, your doctor may suggest surgery to remove the bursa. This is rarely needed. If you have surgery, your hip will function just fine without the inflamed bursa. A new bursa sac will grow back.</text></h2><h2 title="Prevention"><text>Overuse is the most common cause of hip bursitis. To help prevent hip pain:</text><detail>Always warm up and stretch before exercising and cool down afterward. Stretch your quadriceps and hamstrings.</detail><detail>Don't increase the distance, intensity, and amount of time you exercise all at the same time.</detail><detail>Avoid running straight down hills. Walk down instead.</detail><detail>Swim instead of running or cycling.</detail><detail>Run on a smooth, soft surface, such as a track. Avoid running on cement.</detail><detail>If you have flat feet, try special shoe inserts and arch supports (orthotics).</detail><detail>Make sure your running shoes fit well and have good cushioning. </detail></h2><h2 title="When to Call the Doctor"><text>Call your provider if symptoms come back or do not improve after 2 weeks of treatment.</text><text>Get medical help right away if you have any of the following:</text><detail>Your hip pain is caused by a serious fall or other injury</detail><detail>Your leg is deformed, badly bruised, or bleeding</detail><detail>You are unable to move your hip or bear any weight on your leg </detail></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>Bursitis of the hip; Hip bursitis</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 11/27/2016"><text>Updated by: C.

<item><title>Trigger finger</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000565.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>Trigger finger occurs when a finger or thumb gets stuck in a bent position, as if you were squeezing a trigger. Once it gets unstuck, the finger pops straight out, like a trigger being released.</text><text>In severe cases, the finger cannot be straightened. Surgery is needed to correct it.</text></h2><h2 title="What is a Trigger Finger?"><text>Tendons connect muscles to bones. When you tighten a muscle, it pulls on the tendon, and this causes the bone to move.</text><text>The tendons that move your finger slide through a tendon sheath (tunnel) as you bend your finger.</text><detail>If the tunnel swells and becomes smaller, or the tendon has a bump on it, the tendon cannot slide smoothly through the tunnel.</detail><detail>When it cannot slide smoothly, the tendon may become stuck when you try to straighten your finger.</detail></h2><h2 title="About Trigger Finger"><text>If you have a trigger finger:</text><detail>Your finger is stiff or it locks in a bent position.</detail><detail>You have painful snapping or popping when you bend and straighten your finger.</detail><detail>Your symptoms are worse in the morning.</detail><detail>You have a tender bump on the palm side of your hand at the base of your finger. </detail><text>Trigger finger can occur in both children and adults. It is more common in people who: </text><detail>Are over 45 years old</detail><detail>Are female</detail><detail>Have diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, or gout</detail><detail>Do work or activities that require repeated gripping of their hands </detail><text>Trigger finger is diagnosed by medical history and a physical exam. Trigger finger usually does not require x-rays or lab tests. You can have more than one trigger finger and it can develop in both hands.</text></h2><h2 title="Treating Trigger Finger Without Surgery"><text>In mild cases, the goal is to decrease swelling in the tunnel.</text><text>Self-care management mainly includes:</text><detail>Allowing the tendon to rest. Your health care provider may ask you to wear a splint. Or, the provider may tape your finger to one of your other fingers (called buddy taping).</detail><detail>Applying heat and ice and stretching may also be helpful. </detail><text>Your provider may also give you a shot of a medicine called cortisone. The shot goes into the tunnel that the tendon goes through. This can help reduce swelling. Your provider may try a second shot if the first one does not work. </text></h2><h2 title="Surgery for Trigger Finger"><text>You may need surgery if your finger is locked in a bent position or does not get better with other treatment. The surgery is done under local anesthesia or a nerve block. This prevents pain. You may be awake during surgery. </text><text>During the surgery your surgeon will: </text><detail>Make a small cut in your skin just below the tunnel (sheath covering the tendon) of your trigger finger.</detail><detail>Then make a small cut in the tunnel. If you are awake during surgery, you may be asked to move your finger.</detail><detail>Close your skin with stitches and put compression or tight bandage on your hand. </detail><text>After surgery: </text><detail>Keep the bandage on for 48 hours. After that, you can use a simple bandage, like a Band-Aid.</detail><detail>Your stitches will be removed after about 2 weeks.</detail><detail>You can use your finger normally once it has healed. </detail></h2><h2 title="When to Call the Doctor"><text>If you notice signs of infection, call your surgeon right away. Signs of infection include: </text><detail>Redness in your cut or hand</detail><detail>Swelling or warmth in your cut or hand</detail><detail>Yellow or green drainage from the cut</detail><detail>Hand pain or discomfort</detail><detail>Fever </detail><text>If your trigger finger returns, call your surgeon.

<item><title>Tremor - self-care</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000564.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>A tremor is a type of shaking in your body. Most tremors are in the hands and arms. But, they may affect any body part, even your head or voice.</text></h2><h2 title="More About Tremors"><text>For many people with a tremor, the cause is not found. Some types of tremors run in families. A tremor may also be part of a long-term brain or nerve disorder.</text><text>Some medicines can cause tremors. Talk with your health care provider if a medicine may be causing your tremor. Your provider may lower the dosage or switch you to another medicine. DO NOT change or stop any medicine before you talk with your provider.</text><text>You may not need treatment for your tremor unless it interferes with your daily life or is embarrassing for you.</text></h2><h2 title="Lifestyle Changes can Help"><text>Most tremors become worse when you are tired.</text><detail>Try not to do too much during the day.</detail><detail>Get enough sleep. Ask your provider about how you can change your sleep habits if you have problems sleeping.</detail><text>Stress and anxiety can also make your tremor worse. These things may lower your stress level:</text><detail>Meditation, deep relaxation, or breathing exercises</detail><detail>Reducing your caffeine intake</detail><text>Alcohol use can also cause tremors. If it is the cause of your tremors, seek treatment and support. Your provider can help you find a treatment program that may help you stop drinking.</text></h2><h2 title="Managing Your Tremor Day-to-day"><text>Tremors can worsen over time. They may begin to interfere with your ability to do your daily activities. To help in your day-to-day activities:</text><detail>Buy clothes with Velcro fasteners instead of buttons or hooks.</detail><detail>Cook or eat with utensils that have larger handles that are easier to grip.</detail><detail>Drink from half-filled cups to avoid spilling.</detail><detail>Use straws to drink so you do not have to pick up your glass.</detail><detail>Wear slip-on shoes and use shoehorns.</detail><detail>Wear a heavier bracelet or watch.

<item><title>Treatment for childhood cancer - long-term risks</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000849.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>Today's cancer treatments help cure many children of cancer. These treatments also may cause health problems later on. These are called "late effects."</text><text>Late effects are treatment side effects that appear several months or years after treatment for cancer. Late effects can impact one or more areas of the body. Effects can be mild to severe. Examples include learning, vision, joint, or teeth problems.</text><text>Whether your child will have late effects depend on the type of cancer and the treatments your child has. Being aware of your child's risk of long-term health problems can help you follow-up with health care providers and detect any problems early. </text></h2><h2 title="What Causes Late Effects"><text>Some cancer treatments damage healthy cells. The damage is not seen during treatment, but as the child's body grows, changes in cell growth or function appear. </text><text>The medicines used for chemotherapy and the high-energy rays used in radiation therapy can harm healthy cells. This damage can change or delay the way cells grow. Radiation therapy has a more direct effect on long-term growth than chemotherapy.</text><text>When cancer surgery is performed, it may cause changes in the growth or function of an organ.</text><text>Your child's health care team will come up with a treatment plan to avoid harming healthy cells as much as possible. </text></h2><h2 title="Risk Factors "><text>Every child is unique. The risk of getting a late effect depends on many factors such as:</text><detail>Child's overall health before cancer</detail><detail>Child's age at the time of treatment</detail><detail>Dose of radiation therapy and what body organs received radiation</detail><detail>Chemotherapy type and total dose</detail><detail>How long the treatment was needed</detail><detail>Type of cancer being treated and area of body involved</detail><detail>Child's genetic background (some children are more sensitive to treatments) </detail></h2><h2 title="Types of Late Effects"><text>There are many types of late effects depending on where the cancer was and what types of treatments were done. Many of the effects can be managed. The following are examples of some late effects based on body parts affected.</text><text>Brain:</text><detail>Learning</detail><detail>Memory</detail><detail>Attention</detail><detail>Language</detail><detail>Behavior and emotional problems</detail><detail>Seizures, headaches </detail><text>Ears:</text><detail>Hearing loss</detail><detail>Ringing in the ears</detail><detail>Dizziness </detail><text>Eyes:</text><detail>Vision problems</detail><detail>Dry or watery eyes</detail><detail>Sensitivity to light</detail><detail>Irritation</detail><detail>Drooping eyelid</detail><detail>Eyelid tumors </detail><text>Lungs:</text><detail>Infections</detail><detail>Shortness of breath</detail><detail>Persistent cough</detail><detail>Trouble breathing</detail><detail>Lung cancer </detail><text>Mouth:</text><detail>Small or missing teeth</detail><detail>Risk for cavities</detail><detail>Sensitive teeth</detail><detail>Delayed tooth development</detail><detail>Gum disease</detail><detail>Dry mouth </detail><text>Other late effects may include:</text><detail>Muscle or bone can be affected in any area of the body where treatments were needed. It may impact how a child walks or runs or cause bone or muscle pain, weakness, or stiffness.</detail><detail>Glands and organs that make hormones may be exposed to treatments. These include the thyroid gland in the neck and pituitary gland in the brain. This can have an effect on later growth, metabolism, puberty, fertility, and other functions.</detail><detail>The heart's rhythm or function may be affected by certain treatments.</detail><detail>A small increase in risk of getting another cancer later in life. </detail><text>Most of the effects above are physical. There may be long-term emotional effects as well. Coping with health problems, extra medical visits, or the worries that come with cancer can be a lifelong challenge. </text></h2><h2 title="Preventing Health Problems"><text>Many late effects cannot be prevented, but others can be managed or treated. </text><text>There are some things your child can do to help prevent other health problems and detect problems early such as:</text><detail>Eat healthy foods</detail><detail>DO NOT smoke</detail><detail>Exercise regularly</detail><detail>Maintain a healthy weight</detail><detail>Have regular screenings and tests, including the heart and lungs </detail></h2><h2 title="Follow-Up"><text>Watching for late effects will be a key part of your child's care for many years. The Children's Oncology Group (COG) creates guidelines for long-term follow-up in children and adolescents who have had cancer. Ask your child's provider about the guidelines. Follow these general steps:</text><detail>Make regular appointments for physical exams and tests.</detail><detail>Keep detailed records of your child's treatments.</detail><detail>Get copies of all medical reports.</detail><detail>Keep a contact list of your child's health care team.</detail><detail>Ask your child's provider what late effects your child may want to look out for based on the treatments.</detail><detail>Share information about the cancer with future providers.</detail><text>Regular follow-up and care gives your child the best chance of recovery and good health.</text></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>Childhood cancer - late effects</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 7/26/2018"><text>Updated by: Todd Gersten, MD, Hematology/Oncology, Florida Cancer Specialists &amp;amp; Research Institute, Wellington, FL.

<item><title>Tracheostomy tube - speaking</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000465.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>Speaking is a key part of communicating with people. Having a tracheostomy tube can change your ability to talk and interact with others.</text><text>However, you can learn how to speak with a tracheostomy tube. It just takes practice. There are even speaking devices that can help you. </text></h2><h2 title="Tracheostomy Tubes and Speaking"><text>Air passing through vocal cords (larynx) causes them to vibrate, creating sounds and speech.</text><text>A tracheostomy tube blocks most of the air from passing through your vocal cords. Instead, your breath (air) goes out through your tracheostomy tube (trach).</text><text>At the time of your surgery, the first trach tube will have a balloon (cuff) that lies in your trachea.</text><detail>If the cuff is inflated (filled with air), it will prevent air from moving through your vocal cords. This will stop you from making noise or speech.</detail><detail>If the cuff is deflated, the air is able to move around the trach and through your vocal cords, and you should be able to make sounds. However, most of the time the trach tube is changed after 5 to 7 days to a smaller, cuffless trach. This makes speaking much easier.</detail></h2><h2 title="Practicing "><text>If your tracheostomy has a cuff, it will need to be deflated. Your caregiver should make the decision about when to deflate your cuff.</text><text>When the cuff is deflated and air can pass around your trach, you should try to talk and make sounds.</text><text>Speaking will be harder than before you had your trach. You may need to use more force to push the air out through your mouth. To speak:</text><detail>Take a deep breath in.</detail><detail>Breathe out, using more force than you normally would to push the air out.</detail><detail>Close off the trach tube opening with your finger and then speak.</detail><detail>You may not hear much at first.</detail><detail>You will build up the strength to push the air out through your mouth as you practice.</detail><detail>The sounds you make will get louder. </detail><text>In order to speak, it is important that you place a clean finger over the trach to prevent air from exiting through the trach. This will help the air go out through your mouth to make voice.</text></h2><h2 title="Speaking Valves"><text>If it is hard to speak with a trach in place, special devices can help you learn to create sounds.</text><text>One-way valves, called speaking valves, are placed onto your tracheostomy. Speaking valves allow air to enter through the tube and exit through your mouth and nose. This will allow you to make noises and speak more easily without needing to use your finger to block your trach each time you talk.</text><text>Some patients may not be able to use these valves. The speech therapist will work with you to ensure you are a good candidate. If a speaking valve is placed on your trach, and you have trouble breathing, the valve may not be allowing enough air to pass around your trach.</text></h2><h2 title="Other Factors to Think About"><text>The width of the tracheostomy tube may play a role. If the tube takes up too much space in your throat, there may not be enough room for the air to pass around the tube.</text><text>Your trach may be fenestrated. This means the trach has extra holes built into it. These holes allow air to pass through your vocal cords. They can make it easier to eat and breathe with a tracheostomy tube.</text><text>It may take much longer to develop speech if you have:</text><detail>Vocal cord damage</detail><detail>Injury to the vocal cord nerves, which can change the way the vocal cords move </detail></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>Trach - speaking</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 10/17/2017"><text>Updated by: Josef Shargorodsky, MD, MPH, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD.

<item><title>Tracheostomy tube - eating</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000464.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>Most people with a tracheostomy tube will be able to eat normally. However, it may feel different when you swallow foods or liquids.</text></h2><h2 title="Eating and Tracheostomy Tubes"><text>When you get your tracheostomy tube, or trach, you may be first started on a liquid or very soft diet. Later the trach tube will be changed to a smaller size which will make swallowing easier. In some cases, your health care provider will tell you not to eat right away if there is a concern that your swallowing is impaired. Instead, you will get nutrients through an IV (an intravenous catheter placed in a vein) or a feeding tube. However, this is not common.</text><text>Once you have healed from surgery, your provider will tell you when it is safe to advance your diet to take in solids and liquids by mouth. At this time, a speech therapist will also help you learn how to swallow with a trach.</text><detail>The speech therapist may perform some tests to look for problems and make sure you are safe.</detail><detail>The therapist will show you how to eat and will be able to help you take your first bites. </detail><text>Certain factors may make eating or swallowing harder, such as:</text><detail>Changes in the structure or anatomy of your airway</detail><detail>Not having eaten for a long period of time </detail><text>You may not have a taste for food anymore, or muscles may not work well together. Ask your provider or therapist about why it is hard for you to swallow. </text></h2><h2 title="Tips for Eating and Swallowing"><text>These tips may help with swallowing problems.</text><detail>Keep mealtimes relaxed.</detail><detail>Sit up as straight as possible when you eat.</detail><detail>Take small bites, less than 1 teaspoon (5 mL) of food per bite.</detail><detail>Chew well and swallow your food before taking another bite. </detail><text>If your tracheostomy tube has a cuff, the speech therapist or provider will ensure the cuff is deflated during meal times. This will make it easier to swallow. </text><text>If you have a speaking valve, you may use it while you eat. It will make it easier to swallow. </text><text>Suction the tracheostomy tube before eating. This will keep you from coughing while eating, which could make you throw up. </text></h2><h2 title="When to Call the Doctor"><text>You and your health care provider must watch for 2 important problems:</text><detail>Choking and breathing food particles into your airway (called aspiration) that can lead to a lung infection</detail><detail>Not getting enough calories and nutrients </detail><text>Call your provider if any of the following problems occur:</text><detail>Choking and coughing while eating or drinking</detail><detail>Cough, fever, or shortness of breath</detail><detail>Food particles found in secretions from the tracheostomy</detail><detail>Larger amounts of watery or discolored secretions from the tracheostomy</detail><detail>Losing weight without trying, or poor weight gain</detail><detail>Lungs sound more congested</detail><detail>More frequent colds or chest infections</detail><detail>Swallowing problems are getting worse </detail></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>Trach - eating</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 10/17/2017"><text>Updated by: Josef Shargorodsky, MD, MPH, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD.

<item><title>Tracheostomy care</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000076.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>A tracheostomy is surgery to create a hole in your neck that goes into your windpipe. If you need it for just a short time, it will be closed later. Some people need the hole for the rest of their life.</text><text>The hole is needed when your airway is blocked, or for some conditions that make it hard for you to breathe. You may need a tracheostomy if you are on a breathing machine (ventilator) for a long time.</text><text>After the hole is made, a plastic tube is placed in the hole to keep it open. A ribbon is tied around the neck to keep the tube in place.</text></h2><h2 title="When You're in the Hospital"><text>Before you leave the hospital, health care providers will teach you how to do the following:</text><detail>Clean, replace, and suction the tube</detail><detail>Keep the air you breathe moist</detail><detail>Clean the hole with water and mild soap or hydrogen peroxide</detail><detail>Change the dressing around the hole </detail><text>DO NOT do strenuous activity or hard exercise for 6 weeks after surgery. After your surgery, you may not be able to speak. Ask your provider for a referral to a speech therapist to help you learn to talk with your tracheostomy. This is usually possible once your condition improves.</text></h2><h2 title="Self-care"><text>You will have a small amount of mucus around the tube. This is normal. The hole in your neck should be pink and painless.</text><text>It is important to keep the tube free of thick mucus. You should always carry an extra tube with you in case your tube gets plugged. Once you put in the new tube, clean the old one and keep it with you as your extra tube.</text><text>When you cough, have a tissue or cloth ready to catch the mucus coming from your tube.</text><text>Your nose will no longer keep the air you breathe moist. Talk with your provider about how to keep the air you breathe moist and how to prevent plugs in your tube.</text><text>Some common ways to keep the air you breathe moist are:</text><detail>Putting a wet gauze or cloth over the outside of your tube. Keep it moist.</detail><detail>Using a humidifier in your home when the heater is on and the air is dry. </detail><text>A few drops of salt water (saline) will loosen a plug of thick mucus. Put a few drops in your tube and windpipe, then take a deep breath and cough to help bring up the mucus.</text><text>Protect the hole in your neck with a cloth or tracheostomy cover when you go outside. These covers can also help keep your clothes clean from mucus and make your breathing sounds quieter.</text><text>DO NOT breathe in water, food, powder, or dust. When you take a shower, cover the hole with a tracheostomy cover. You will not be able to go swimming.</text><text>To speak, you will need to cover the hole with your finger, a cap, or a speaking valve.</text><text>Sometimes you can cap the tube. Then you might be able to speak normally and breathe through your nose and mouth.</text></h2><h2 title="Caring for Your Tracheostomy "><text>Once the hole in your neck is not sore from the surgery, clean the hole with a cotton swab or a cotton ball at least once a day to prevent infection.</text><text>The bandage (gauze dressing) between your tube and neck helps catch mucus. It also keeps your tube from rubbing on your neck. Change the bandage when it is dirty, at least once a day.</text><text>Change the ribbons (trach ties) that keep your tube in place if they get dirty. Make sure you hold the tube in place when you change the ribbon. Be sure you can fit 2 fingers under the ribbon to make sure it is not too tight.</text></h2><h2 title="When to Call the Doctor"><text>Call your doctor if you have:</text><detail>Fever or chills</detail><detail>Redness, swelling, or pain that is getting worse</detail><detail>Bleeding or drainage from the hole</detail><detail>Too much mucus that is hard to suction or cough up</detail><detail>Cough or shortness of breath, even after you suction your tube</detail><detail>Nausea or vomiting</detail><detail>Any new or unusual symptoms </detail><text>Call your local emergency number if your tracheostomy tube falls out and you cannot replace it.</text></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>Respiratory failure - tracheostomy care; Ventilator - tracheostomy care; Respiratory insufficiency - tracheostomy care</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 8/21/2016"><text>Updated by: Denis Hadjiliadis, MD, MHS, Paul F.

<item><title>Toilet training tips</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000944.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>Learning how to use the toilet is a big milestone in your child's life. You'll make the process easier for everyone if you wait until your child is ready before attempting to toilet train. A dose of patience and a sense of humor also help.</text></h2><h2 title="When to Start Training"><text>Most children start to show signs that they are ready for toilet training between ages 18 and 30 months. Before 18 months, most children can't fully control their bladder and bowel muscles. Your child will let you know in her own way that she is ready to start toilet training. Children are ready when they:</text><detail>Show interest in the toilet or in wearing underpants</detail><detail>Express through words or expressions that they need to go to the bathroom</detail><detail>Hint that the diaper is wet or dirty</detail><detail>Feel uncomfortable if the diaper gets dirty and try to remove it without help</detail><detail>Stay dry for at least 2 hours during the day</detail><detail>Can pull down their pants and pull them back up</detail><detail>Can understand and follow basic instructions </detail><text>It's a good idea to choose a time when you don't have other major events planned, such as a vacations, a big move, or a work project that will require extra time from you.</text><text>Don't push your child to learn too quickly. If your child feels pressure to potty train before they are ready, it may take longer for them to learn. If your child resists the training, it means they aren't ready yet. So back off and wait a few weeks before trying again. </text></h2><h2 title="Getting Ready"><text>To start potty training you will need to:</text><detail>Buy a training potty seat and potty chair - you may need more than one if you have bathrooms or play areas on different levels of the house.</detail><detail>Place the potty chair near your child's play area so they can see and touch it.</detail><detail>Establish a routine. Once a day, have your child sit on the potty fully clothed. Never force them to sit on it, and let them get off it when they want to.</detail><detail>Once they are comfortable sitting on the chair, have them sit on it without diapers and pants. Show them how to pull down their pants before getting on the potty.</detail><detail>Children learn by watching others. Let your child watch you or their siblings use the toilet and let them practice flushing it.</detail><detail>Help your child know how to talk about the bathroom using simple terms like 'poop' and 'pee'. </detail></h2><h2 title="Teaching Your Child to Use the Toilet"><text>Once your child is comfortable sitting on the potty chair without diapers, you can start to show them how to use it.</text><detail>Put stool from their diaper into the potty chair.</detail><detail>Have them watch while you transfer the stool from the potty chair into the toilet.</detail><detail>Have them flush the toilet and watch as it flushes. This will help them learn that the toilet is where poop goes.</detail><detail>Be alert for when your child signals that they might need to use toilet. Take your child to the potty quickly and praise your child for telling you.</detail><detail>Teach your child to stop what they are doing and go to the potty when they feel like they need to go to the bathroom.</detail><detail>Stay with your child when they are sitting on the potty. Reading a book or talking to them may help them relax.</detail><detail>Teach your child to wipe themselves after passing stool. Teach girls to wipe from front to back to help prevent stool from getting near the vagina.</detail><detail>Be sure your child washes their hands properly every time after using the toilet.</detail><detail>Praise your child every time they go to the toilet, even if all they do is sit there. Your goal is to help them connect the feelings of needing to go to the bathroom with going to the toilet and using it.</detail><detail>Once your child has learned how to use the toilet pretty regularly, you may want to try using pull-up training pants. That way your child can get in and out of them without help. </detail><text>Most children take about 3 to 6 months to learn how to use the toilet. Girls usually learn to use the toilet faster than boys. Children commonly remain in diapers till about age 2 to 3 years old.</text><text>Even after staying dry during the day, most children need more time to be able to sleep through the night without wetting the bed. This is the last stage of toilet training. It's a good idea to get a water-proof mattress pad while your child learns nighttime control.</text></h2><h2 title="Accidents Will Happen"><text>Expect that your child will have accidents as they learn to use the toilet. It's just part of the process. Sometimes, even after the training, accidents may occur during the daytime too.</text><text>When these events occur it's important to:</text><detail>Stay calm</detail><detail>Clean up and gently remind your child to use the toilet the next time. Never scold your child.</detail><detail>Reassure your child if they get upset. </detail><text>To prevent such events you can:</text><detail>Ask your child from time to time if they want to go to toilet. Most children need to go about an hour or so after a meal or after drinking a lot of fluids.</detail><detail>Get absorbent underwear for your child if they have frequent accidents. </detail></h2><h2 title="When to Call the Doctor"><text>Call the doctor if your child:</text><detail>Has been potty trained earlier but is having more accidents now</detail><detail>Does not use the toilet even after 4 years of age</detail><detail>Has pain with urination or stools</detail><detail>Often has wetting issues -- this could be a sign of a urinary infection </detail></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>Potty training </text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 12/9/2016"><text>Updated by: Neil K.

<item><title>Tips for labor coaches</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000545.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>You have a big job as the labor coach. You are the main person who will:</text><detail>Help the mother as labor begins at home.</detail><detail>Stay and comfort her through labor and the birth.</detail><text>Whether you are helping the mother breathe or giving her a backrub, you will also be a familiar face on a hectic day. Just being there counts for a lot. Here are some tips for getting prepared.</text></h2><h2 title="Before the big day Arrives"><text>Labor coaches should go to childbirth classes with the mother-to-be before her due date. These classes will help you learn how to comfort and support her when the big day arrives.</text><text>Get to know the hospital. Take a tour of the hospital prior to the birth. A tour may be part of the childbirth classes. Talk with the staff on the labor and delivery unit to get an idea of what will happen on the big day.</text><text>Know what the mom expects. You and the mother should talk ahead of time about what should happen on the day of delivery.</text><detail>Does the mother-to-be want to use breathing techniques?</detail><detail>Does she want you to be hands-on?</detail><detail>How can you help soothe her pain?</detail><detail>How involved does she want the midwife to be?</detail><detail>When does she want to get pain medicine?</detail><text>Natural childbirth is very hard work. A woman may decide on natural childbirth at first, but find that the pain is too much to bear when she is in labor. Talk with her ahead of time about how she wants you to respond at this point.</text><text>Write down a plan. A written plan for the labor and delivery will help make things clear ahead of time. Of course, when the contractions are in high gear, many of those decisions may change. This is OK. Give her your full support around how she wants to get through her labor and delivery.</text></h2><h2 title="When the day Arrives"><text>You might be at the hospital for many hours. So remember to bring things to the hospital for yourself, such as: </text><detail>Snacks</detail><detail>Books or magazines</detail><detail>Your music player and headphones or small speakers</detail><detail>A change of clothes</detail><detail>Toiletries</detail><detail>Comfortable walking shoes</detail><detail>Pillows </detail><text>It may take a long time for the baby to be born. Be prepared to wait. Labor and delivery can be a long process. Be patient.</text></h2><h2 title="At the hospital"><text>When you are at the hospital:</text><detail>Be an advocate. There may be times when the mother needs something from the doctors or nurses. She may need for you to speak up for her.</detail><detail>Make decisions. At times you will have to make decisions for the mother. For example, if she is in severe pain and can't speak for herself, you may decide it is time to find a nurse or doctor who can help.</detail><detail>Encourage the mother. Labor is hard work. You can cheer her on and let her know that she is doing a good job.</detail><detail>Ease her discomfort. You can massage the mother's lower back or help her take warm showers to ease the pains of childbirth.</detail><detail>Help her find a distraction. As labor gets more painful, it will help to have a distraction, or something that will take her mind off of what is happening. Some people bring items from home, like a photo or a teddy bear that the mother can focus on. Others find something in the hospital room, like a spot on the wall or on the ceiling.</detail><detail>Be flexible. The mother will get so focused during the contractions that she may not want or need you at all. She may ignore you or may get angry at you or others in the room. Don't take anything said during labor personally. It will all be a blur after the baby is born.</detail><detail>Remember, just having you there will mean so much to the mother. Having a child is a very emotional journey. You are being helpful by just being there every step of the way.</detail></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>Pregnancy - labor coach; Delivery - labor coach</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 4/19/2018"><text>Updated by: John D.

<item><title>Time outs</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000756.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>Time out is a parenting technique to encourage children to stop doing things that you do not want them to do. When your child misbehaves, you can calmly remove your child from the activity and put them in time out. Your child usually will stop doing the behavior to avoid going into time out. Time out is mostly effective with children, 2 to 12 years old.</text></h2><h2 title="Why Does Time out Work?"><text>When you put children in time out, you show them with action that you do not like their behaviors. It works better than shouting, threatening, or spanking.</text><text>Time out removes your child from the behavior. It gives you and your child time to calm down and get control over yourself. Children in time out also have time to think about what they did.</text></h2><h2 title="Using Time out"><text>Pick one or two behaviors you really want to work on with your child. Use time out consistently with these behaviors. Take care not to overuse time out. Only use it for a behavior you really want to stop.</text><text>Let children know ahead of time that you will be using time out. For instance, tell them, "Next time you are fighting over toys, everyone is going in a time out for 3 minutes. I will tell you when 3 minutes is up."</text><text>Choose a place ahead of time. Make sure it is a boring spot away from the TV and toys. It should not be a place that is dark or scary. If your children are young, make sure you can see them. Some places that might work include:</text><detail>A chair in the hallway</detail><detail>The corner of the room</detail><detail>The bedroom</detail><detail>A crib </detail><text>When children misbehave, give them a warning to stop. Tell them, "No hitting. That hurts. If you don't stop hitting, you will have a time out."</text><detail>When children stop misbehaving, praise them for controlling their behavior.</detail><detail>When children do not stop misbehaving, tell them to go in time out. Only say it once: "Hitting hurts. You need a time out." </detail><text>Be clear and calm. Do not lose your temper. When you yell and nag, you give your children's bad behavior too much attention.</text><text>Some children may go into time out as soon as you tell them to. When children do not go on their own, lead them or carry them to the time out spot. Do not yell or spank on the way to time out.</text><text>Put your child in time out for 1 minute per year of age, but no longer than 5 minutes. For example, if your child is 3 years old, time out is for 3 minutes.</text><text>Older children can be told they are in time out until they are ready to return to their activity and behave. Because they decide when they are ready, they learn to control their behavior.</text><text>If your children do not stay in their time out spots, gently hold them there. Do not talk to them or give them any attention.</text><text>If you set a timer and your child makes noise or misbehaves in time out, reset the timer. If the child wanders away, lead the child back to the spot and reset the timer. The child must be quiet and well-behaved until the timer goes off.</text><text>When time out is over, let children return to their activities. Do not lecture about the bad behavior. Children eventually get the message with the time out.</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 9/5/2017"><text>Updated by: Neil K.

<item><title>Thyroid gland removal - discharge</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000293.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>You had surgery to remove part or all of your thyroid gland. This operation is called thyroidectomy.</text><text>Now that you're going home, follow the surgeon's instructions on how to care for yourself at home.</text></h2><h2 title="When You're in the Hospital"><text>Depending on the reason for the surgery, either all or part of your thyroid was removed.</text><text>You probably spent 1 to 3 days in the hospital.</text></h2><h2 title="What to Expect at Home"><text>You may have a drain with a bulb coming from your incision. This drain removes any blood or other fluids that might build up in this area.</text><text>You may have some pain and soreness in your neck at first, especially when you swallow. Your voice may be a little hoarse for the first week. You will probably be able to start your everyday activities in just a few weeks.</text><text>If you had thyroid cancer, you may need to have radioactive iodine treatment soon.</text><text>Get plenty of rest when you get home. Keep your head raised while you are sleeping for the first week.</text></h2><h2 title="Managing Your Pain"><text>Your surgeon may have prescribed a narcotic pain medicine. Or, you may take over-the-counter pain medicine, such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) or acetaminophen (Tylenol). Take your pain medicines as instructed.</text><text>You may put a cold compress on your surgical cut for 15 minutes at a time to ease pain and swelling. DO NOT put the ice directly on your skin. Wrap the compress or ice in a towel to prevent cold injury to the skin. Keep the area dry.</text></h2><h2 title="Wound Care"><text>Follow instructions on how to care for your incision.</text><detail>If the incision was covered with skin glue or surgical tape strips, you may shower with soap the day after surgery. Pat the area dry. The tape will fall off after a few weeks.</detail><detail>If your incision was closed with stitches, ask your surgeon when you can shower.</detail><detail>If you have a drainage bulb, empty it 2 times a day. Keep track of the amount of fluid you empty each time. Your surgeon will tell you when it is time to remove the drain.</detail><detail>Change your wound dressing the way your nurse showed you.</detail></h2><h2 title="Your Diet During Recovery"><text>You can eat whatever you like after surgery. Try to eat healthy foods. You may find it hard to swallow at first. If so, it may be easier to drink liquids and eat soft foods such as pudding, Jello, mashed potatoes, apple sauce, or yogurt.</text><text>Pain medicines can cause constipation. Eating high-fiber foods and drinking plenty of fluids will help make your stools softer. If this does not help, try using a fiber product. You can buy this at a drug store.</text></h2><h2 title="Activity"><text>Give yourself time to heal. DO NOT do any strenuous activities, such as heavy lifting, jogging, or swimming for the first few weeks.</text><text>Slowly start your normal activities when you feel ready. DO NOT drive if you are taking narcotic pain medicines.</text><text>Cover your incision with clothing or very strong sunscreen when you are in the sun for the first year after surgery. This will make your scar show less.</text></h2><h2 title="Thyroid Hormone Replacement"><text>You may need to take thyroid hormone medicine for the rest of your life to replace your natural thyroid hormone.</text><text>You may not need hormone replacement if only part of your thyroid was removed.</text><text>See your doctor for regular blood tests and to go over your symptoms. Your doctor will change the dosage of your hormone medicine based on your blood tests and symptoms.</text><text>You may not start thyroid hormone replacement right away, especially if you had thyroid cancer.</text></h2><h2 title="Follow-up"><text>You will probably see your surgeon in about 2 weeks after surgery. If you have stitches or a drain, your surgeon will remove them.</text><text>You may need long-term care from an endocrinologist. This is a doctor who treats problems with glands and hormones.</text></h2><h2 title="When to Call the Doctor"><text>Call your surgeon or nurse if you have:</text><detail>Increased soreness or pain around your incision</detail><detail>Redness or swelling of your incision</detail><detail>Bleeding from your incision</detail><detail>Fever of 100.5°F (38°C), or higher</detail><detail>Chest pain or discomfort</detail><detail>A weak voice</detail><detail>Difficulty eating</detail><detail>A lot of coughing</detail><detail>Numbness or tingling in your face or lips </detail></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>Total thyroidectomy - discharge; Partial thyroidectomy - discharge; Thyroidectomy - discharge; Subtotal thyroidectomy - discharge</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 2/11/2017"><text>Updated by: Debra G.

The surgeon made a cut (incision) over the injured tendon, then scraped away (excise) the unhealthy part of your tendon and repaired it.</text><text>At home, be sure to follow your surgeon's instructions on how to take care of your new elbow.</text></h2><h2 title="What to Expect"><text>Soon after surgery, severe pain will decrease, but you may have mild soreness for 3 to 6 months. </text></h2><h2 title="Symptom Relief"><text>Place an ice pack on the dressing (bandage) over your wound (incision) 4 to 6 times a day for about 20 minutes each time. Ice helps keep swelling down. Wrap the ice pack in a clean towel or cloth. DO NOT place it directly on the dressing.</text><text>Taking ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) or other similar medicines may help. Ask your doctor about using them.</text><text>Your doctor may give you a prescription for pain medicines. Get it filled on your way home so you have it when you need it. </text></h2><h2 title="Wound Care"><text>The first week after surgery you may have a thick bandage or a splint. You should begin moving your arm gently, as recommended by your surgeon.</text><text>After the first week, your bandage, splint, and stitches will be removed.</text><text>Keep your bandage and your wound clean and dry. Your surgeon will tell you when it is OK to change your dressing. Also change your dressing if it gets dirty or wet.</text><text>You will likely see your surgeon in about 1 week. </text></h2><h2 title="Activity and Exercise"><text>You should start stretching exercises after the splint is removed to increase flexibility and range of motion. The surgeon may also refer you to see a physical therapist to work on stretching and strengthening your forearm muscles. This can begin after 3 to 4 weeks. Keep doing the exercises for as long as you are told. This helps ensure tennis elbow will not return.</text><text>You may be prescribed a wrist brace. If so, wear it to avoid extending your wrist and pulling on the repaired elbow tendon.</text><text>You should be able to return to normal activity and sports after 4 to 6 months.</text></h2><h2 title="When to Call the Doctor"><text>After the operation, call the surgeon if you notice any of the following around your elbow:</text><detail>Swelling</detail><detail>Severe or increased pain</detail><detail>Changes in skin color around or below your elbow</detail><detail>Numbness or tingling in your fingers or hand</detail><detail>Your hand or fingers look darker than normal or are cool to the touch</detail><detail>Other worrying symptoms, such as increase in pain, redness, or drainage</detail></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>

<item><title>Telehealth</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000919.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>Telehealth is using electronic communications to provide or get health care services. You can get health care using phones, computers, or mobile devices. You find health information or talk with your health care provider using streaming media, video chats, email, or text messages. Your provider can use telehealth to remotely monitor your health with devices that can remotely record vital signs, medicine intake, and other health information. Your provider can also communicate with other providers using telehealth.</text><text>Telehealth is also called telemedicine.</text></h2><h2 title="Information"><text>Telehealth can make it quicker and easier to get or provide health services.</text><text>HOW TO USE TELEHEALTH</text><text>Here are just a few ways telehealth is used. </text><text>Email. You can use email to ask your provider questions or order prescription refills. If you get a test done, the results can be sent to your providers by email. Or, one provider can share and discuss results with another specialist. These may include:</text><detail>X-rays</detail><detail>MRIs</detail><detail>Photos</detail><detail>Patient data</detail><detail>Video-exam clips </detail><text>You can also share your personal health records by email with another provider. That means you do not have to wait for paper records to be mailed to you before your appointment.</text><text>Live video conferencing. You can make an appointment and use video chat to talk to your provider or join online support groups. During an office visit, you and your provider can use video chat to talk with a specialist about your care without everyone being in the same place.</text><text>Mhealth (mobile health). You can use a mobile device to talk with or text your provider. You can use health apps to track things like your blood sugar levels or diet and exercise results and share it with your providers. You can receive text or email reminders for appointments. </text><text>Remote patient monitoring (RPM). This allows your provider to monitor your health from afar. You keep devices to measure your heart, blood pressure, or blood glucose in your home. These devices collect data and send it to your provider to monitor your health. Using RPM can lower your chances of getting sick or needing to go to the hospital.</text><text>RPM can be used for long-term illnesses such as:</text><detail>Diabetes</detail><detail>Heart disease</detail><detail>High blood pressure</detail><detail>Kidney disorders </detail><text>Online health information. You can watch videos to learn specific skills to help you manage health conditions like diabetes or asthma. You can also read health information online to help you make informed decisions about your care with your provider.</text><text>With telehealth, your health information remains private. Providers must use computer software that keeps your health records safe. </text><text>BENEFITS OF TELEHEALTH</text><text>Telehealth has many benefits. It can help:</text><detail>You get care without traveling long distances if you live far from your doctor or medical center</detail><detail>You get expert care from a specialist in a different state or city</detail><detail>You save time and money spent on travelling</detail><detail>Older or disabled adults who have a hard time getting to appointments</detail><detail>You get regular monitoring of health problems without having to go in as often for appointments</detail><detail>Reduce hospitalizations and allow people with chronic disorders have more independence </detail><text>TELEHEALTH AND INSURANCE</text><text>Not all health insurance companies pay for all telehealth services. And services may be limited for people on Medicare or Medicaid. Also, states have different standards for what they will cover. It is a good idea to check with your insurance company to be sure telehealth services will be covered.</text></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>Telehealth; Telemedicine; Mobile health (mHealth); Remote patient monitoring; E-health</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 5/12/2018"><text>Updated by: Laura J.

<item><title>Teenagers and sleep</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000872.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>Starting around puberty, kids start getting tired later at night. While it might seem like they need less sleep, in fact, teens need about 9 hours of sleep at night. Unfortunately, most teens do not get the sleep they need.</text></h2><h2 title="What Makes it Hard for Teens to Sleep?"><text>Several factors make it hard for teens to get the sleep they need:</text><detail>Schedule. The average teen gets tired around 11 p.m. and has to get up between 6 and 7 a.m. to get to school on time. This makes it impossible to get 9 hours of sleep. Some high schools have changed their hours to start later. Students' grades and athletic performance at these schools improved as a result. Just like their parents, many teens are juggling busy schedules. Weeknight school and social activities cut into teens' quality sleep time. They get home later and have a harder time winding down.</detail><detail>Homework. The push to succeed can backfire when kids sacrifice sleep to do homework. After a night of too little sleep, your teen may not be able to focus in class or absorb new material. Teens need both work and rest to keep their minds sharp.</detail><detail>Texting. Phones make poor bedfellows, especially when they go off in the middle of the night. Teens may think every text message has to be answered right away, no matter how late. Even early evening texts can disrupt sleep. Hearing constant text alerts can make it impossible to wind down and relax into sleep. </detail></h2><h2 title="Sleep and Teen Health"><text>Like adults, teens who do not get enough sleep are at risk for a number of problems in school and with their health, including:</text><detail>Depression and low self esteem</detail><detail>Sleepiness and trouble concentrating</detail><detail>Decline in school performance and grades</detail><detail>Moodiness and trouble getting along with family and friends</detail><detail>Greater risk of car accidents</detail><detail>Tendency to overeat and gain weight </detail></h2><h2 title="What Parents can do "><text>Teach your teen ways to get a good night's sleep. Then be a good role model and practice what you preach.</text><detail>Make rules about bedtime. Going to bed at the same time each night can make it easier for your teen to wind down and drift off. Set a bedtime for your teen, and yourself, and make sure you stick with it.</detail><detail>Limit nighttime activities. Keep an eye on the number of nights your teen stays at school late or goes out with friends. Consider limiting the number of weeknights your child stays out past dinner.</detail><detail>Offer homework support. Talk to teens about their class load and homework. If they have a heavy semester, help them schedule homework time and limit other activities. Make sure your kids have a good, quiet place to study.</detail><detail>Set technology boundaries. Talk to your teen about text messages. Ask how they feel if they do not respond to a text right away, then set a time when texting has to stop. You might make a rule that no devices are allowed in the bedroom after a certain hour.</detail><detail>Promote relaxing activities. In the hour or so before bedtime, encourage your child to do something relaxing. This might mean reading a book or taking a warm shower. Encourage your teen to explore ways to unwind so sleep can come. </detail></h2><h2 title="When to Call the Doctor"><text>Call your health care provider if your teen is not sleeping well and it interferes with his or her health or ability to do daily activities.</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 8/22/2016"><text>Updated by: Laura J.

<item><title>Teenage pregnancy </title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000607.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>


 
Most pregnant teenage girls did not plan to get pregnant. If you are a pregnant teen, it is very important to get health care during your pregnancy. Know that there are extra health risks for both you and your baby.

</text></h2><h2 title="When You Find Out You Are Pregnant"><text>Make an appointment with your health care provider after you find out you are pregnant. Talk with your provider about your options for abortion, adoption, or keeping the baby. </text><text>If you decide to continue the pregnancy, it is important to have good prenatal care. Prenatal care will help you stay healthy and ensure you have a healthy baby. Your provider can also provide counseling and refer you to community services to make sure you and your baby have what you need.</text><text>If you do not know where to go and feel like you cannot tell your family or a friend that you are pregnant, talk with your school nurse or school counselor. They can help you find prenatal care and other help in your community. Many communities have resources such as Planned Parenthood, which can help you get the care you need. </text></h2><h2 title="Your Prenatal Visits"><text>At your first prenatal visit, your provider will:</text><detail>Ask you many questions, including the date of your last menstrual period. Knowing this will help the provider figure out how far along you are and what your due date is.</detail><detail>Take a blood sample to do some tests.</detail><detail>Do a full pelvic exam.</detail><detail>Do a Pap test and other tests to check for infections and other problems.</detail><text>Your 1st trimester is the first 3 months of your pregnancy. During this time, you will have a prenatal visit once a month. These visits may be short, but they are still important.</text><text>It is fine to bring a friend or family member, your partner, or your labor coach with you.</text></h2><h2 title="Stay Healthy During Your Pregnancy"><text>You can do many things to help you and your baby stay as healthy as possible.</text><detail>Eating a healthy diet will help you get the nutrients both of you need. Your provider can refer you to community resources to help you learn more about healthy eating.</detail><detail>Prenatal vitamins will help prevent some birth defects. You may also need to take a folic acid supplement.</detail><detail>DO NOT smoke or use alcohol or drugs. These can harm your baby. Ask your provider for help quitting if you need to.</detail><detail>Exercise to help make you stronger for labor and delivery, give you more energy, and may help you sleep better.</detail><detail>Get plenty of sleep. You may need 8 to 9 hours a night, plus rest breaks during the day.</detail><detail>Use a condom if you are still having sex. This will prevent sexually transmitted infections that could hurt you or your baby. </detail></h2><h2 title="Getting Ready to Be a Parent "><text>Try to stay in school during your pregnancy and after you give birth. Talk with your school counselor if you need help with child care or tutoring.</text><text>Your education will give you skills to be a better parent, and it will make you more able to provide for your child financially and emotionally.</text><text>Make a plan for how you will pay for the costs of raising your child. You will need a place to live, food, medical care, and other things. Are there resources in your community that can help? Your school counselor may know what resources are available to you. </text></h2><h2 title="Is Teenage Pregnancy Riskier?"><text>Yes. Teenage pregnancies are riskier than pregnancies in women who are older. This is partly because a teenager's body is still developing, and partly because many pregnant teens do not get the health care they need during pregnancy.</text><text>Risks are:</text><detail>Going into labor early. This is when the baby is born before 37 weeks. A normal pregnancy lasts about 40 weeks.</detail><detail>Low birth weight. Babies of teens are much more likely to weigh less than babies of mothers who are 20 years or older.</detail><detail>High blood pressure that is caused by the pregnancy.</detail><detail>Low levels of iron in the blood (severe anemia), which can cause extreme tiredness and other problems.</detail></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>Prenatal care - teenage pregnancy</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 11/11/2016"><text>Updated by: Irina Burd, MD, PhD, Associate Professor of Gynecology and Obstetrics at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD.

<item><title>Targeted therapies for cancer</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000902.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>Targeted therapy uses drugs to stop cancer from growing and spreading. It does this with less harm to normal cells than other treatments. </text><text>Standard chemotherapy works by killings cancer cells and some normal cells, targeted treatment zeroes in on specific targets (molecules) in or on cancer cells. These targets play a role in how cancer cells grow and survive. Using these targets, the drug disables the cancer cells so they cannot spread.</text></h2><h2 title="How Does Targeted Therapy Work?"><text>Targeted therapy drugs work in a few different ways. They may:</text><detail>Turn off the process in cancer cells that causes them to grow and spread</detail><detail>Trigger cancer cells to die on their own</detail><detail>Kill cancer cells directly </detail><text>People with the same type of cancer may have different targets in their cancer cells. So if your cancer does not have a specific target, the drug will not work to stop it. Not all therapies work for all people with cancer. At the same time, different cancers may have the same target.</text><text>To see if a targeted therapy might work for you, your health care provider may:</text><detail>Take a tiny sample of your cancer</detail><detail>Test the sample for the specific targets (molecules)</detail><detail>If the right target is present in your cancer, then you will receive </detail><text>Some targeted therapies are given as pills. Others are injected into a vein (intravenous, or IV).</text></h2><h2 title="Who may get Targeted Therapy?"><text>There are targeted therapies that can treat certain types of these cancers:</text><detail>Leukemia and lymphoma</detail><detail>Breast cancer</detail><detail>Colon cancer</detail><detail>Skin cancer</detail><detail>Lung cancer</detail><detail>Prostate </detail><text>Other cancers that may be treated with targeted therapies include brain, bone, kidney, lymphoma, stomach, and many others.</text><text>Your provider will decide whether targeted therapies may be an option for your type of cancer. In most cases, you will receive targeted therapy along with surgery, chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, or radiation therapy. You may receive these drugs as part of your regular treatment, or as part of a clinical trial.</text></h2><h2 title="Side Effects"><text>Doctors thought that targeted therapies might have fewer side effects that other cancer treatment. But that turned out to be untrue. Possible side effects from targeted therapies include:</text><detail>Diarrhea</detail><detail>Liver problems</detail><detail>Skin problems such as rash, dry skin, and nail changes</detail><detail>Problems with blood clotting and wound healing</detail><detail>High blood pressure </detail><text>As with any treatment, you may or may not have side effects. They may be mild or severe. Fortunately, they usually go away after treatment ends. It is a good idea to talk with your provider about what to expect. Your provider may be able to help prevent or lessen some side effects.</text></h2><h2 title="Limitations"><text>Targeted therapies are promising new treatments, but they have limitations. </text><detail>Cancer cells can become resistant to these drugs.</detail><detail>The target sometimes changes, so the treatment no longer works.</detail><detail>The cancer may find a different way to grow and survive that does not depend on the target.</detail><detail>Drugs can be difficult to develop for some targets.</detail><detail>Targeted therapies are newer and cost more to make. So they are more expensive than other cancer treatments. </detail></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>Molecularly targeted anticancer agents; MTAs; Chemotherapy-targeted; Vascular endothelial growth factor-targeted; VEGF-targeted; VEGFR-targeted; Tyrosine kinase inhibitor-targeted; TKI-targeted; Personalized medicine - cancer</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 10/21/2017"><text>Updated by: Todd Gersten, MD, Hematology/Oncology, Florida Cancer Specialists &amp;amp; Research Institute, Wellington, FL.

<item><title>Talking with a child about a parent's terminal illness</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000848.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>When a parent's cancer treatment has stopped working, you may wonder how to tell your child. Talking openly and honestly is an important way to help ease your child's anxiety.</text></h2><h2 title="How to Talk to Your Child"><text>You may wonder when it is the right time to talk to your child about death. In truth, there might not be one perfect time. You can give your child time to absorb the news and ask questions by talking soon after you find out your cancer is terminal. Being included in this difficult transition can help your child feel reassured. It can help to know your family will go through this together.</text><text>Age and past experience have a lot to do with what children understand about cancer. While it may be tempting to use euphemisms like, "Mom will be going away," such vague words confuse kids. It is better to be clear about what is going to happen and address your child's fears. </text><detail>Be specific. Tell your child what kind of cancer you have. If you just say you are sick, your child might worry that anyone who gets sick will die.</detail><detail>Let your child know you cannot catch cancer from someone else. Your child does not have to worry about getting it from you, or giving it to friends.</detail><detail>Explain that it is not your child's fault. While this may be obvious to you, kids tend to believe they cause things to happen by what they do or say.</detail><detail>If your child is too young to understand death, talk in terms of the body not working anymore. You might say, "When Dad dies, he will stop breathing. He will not eat or talk anymore."</detail><detail>Tell your child what will happen next. For instance, "The treatment is not going to cure my cancer so the doctors are going to make sure I am comfortable." </detail></h2><h2 title="How Your Child Might React"><text>Your child might ask questions right away or become quiet and want to talk later. You may need to answer the same questions many times while your child comes to terms with the loss. Kids often want to know things like:</text><detail>What will happen to me?</detail><detail>Who will take care of me?</detail><detail>Are you (the other parent) going to die too? </detail><text>Try to reassure your child as much as you can without covering up the truth. Explain that your child will continue to live with the surviving parent after you die. The parent without cancer can say, "I do not have cancer. I plan to be around for a long time."</text><text>If your child asks questions you cannot answer, it is OK to say you do not know. If you think you can find the answer, tell your child you will try to find the answer. </text><text>As kids get older, they become more aware that death is permanent. Your child might grieve on and off into the teen years, as the loss becomes more real. Grief can involve any of these emotions:</text><detail>Guilt. Adults and kids may feel guilty after someone they love dies. Kids might think the death is a punishment for something they did.</detail><detail>Anger. As hard as it is to hear anger expressed toward the dead, this is a normal part of grief.</detail><detail>Regression. Kids can slip back to the behavior of a younger child. Children may resume bedwetting or need more attention from the surviving parent. Try to be patient, and remember that this is temporary.</detail><detail>Depression. Sorrow is a necessary part of grief. But if the sorrow becomes so intense your child cannot cope with life, you should seek help from a mental health professional. </detail></h2><h2 title="How to Help Your Child"><text>You may wish you could take away your child's pain but having the chance to talk through difficult feelings with you can be the best comfort. Explain that your child's feelings, whatever they are, are ok, and that you will listen any time your child wants to talk.</text><text>As much as possible, keep your child involved in normal routines. Say that it is ok to go to school, after-school activities, and out with friends. </text><text>Some children act out when faced with bad news. Your child could have trouble in school or pick fights with friends. Some kids become clingy. Talk to your child's teacher or guidance counselor and let them know what is going on.</text><text>You might talk to the parents of your child's close friends. It may help if your child has friends to talk with. </text></h2><h2 title="Keep Your Child Close"><text>You may be tempted to have your child stay with a friend or relative to spare your child from witnessing death. Most experts say it is more upsetting for children to be sent away. Your child will likely do better being close to you, at home.</text></h2><h2 title="When to Call Your Doctor"><text>If your child is unable to return to normal activities 6 months or longer after a parent dies, or is exhibiting risky behavior, call your health care provider.</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 7/26/2018"><text>Updated by: Todd Gersten, MD, Hematology/Oncology, Florida Cancer Specialists &amp;amp; Research Institute, Wellington, FL.

<item><title>Talking to your teen about drinking</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000505.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>Alcohol use is not just an adult problem. Most American high school seniors have had an alcoholic drink within the past month.</text><text>The best time to begin talking with your teen about drugs and alcohol is now. Children as young as 9 years old may become curious about drinking and they may try alcohol.</text></h2><h2 title="Teens and Alcohol use"><text>About 1 in 5 teens are considered problem drinkers. This means they:</text><detail>Get drunk</detail><detail>Have accidents related to drinking</detail><detail>Get into trouble with the law, their families, friends, schools, or people they date because of their drinking</detail></h2><h2 title="By Saying Nothing, You are Saying Something"><text>Saying nothing to your children about drinking may give them the message that teen drinking is OK. Most children choose not to drink because their parents talk with them about it. </text><text>The best way for your children to be comfortable talking with you about drinking is to be honest and direct. You may want to prepare and think about what you will say ahead of time. </text><text>Tell your child how you feel about them possibly using alcohol. Once you have started talking with your teenager, continue to bring it up at times when you are talking about related issues. </text></h2><h2 title="Free and Curious "><text>Puberty and the teenage years are a time of change. Your child may have just started high school or may have just gotten a driver's license. Your children may have a sense of freedom they never had before. </text><text>Teenagers are curious. They want to explore and do things their own way. But pressure to fit in might make it hard to resist alcohol if it seems like everyone else is trying it. </text><text>When talking with your teen: </text><detail>Encourage your teen to talk to you about drinking. Remain calm when listening and try not to judge or criticize. Make it comfortable for your teen to talk honestly.</detail><detail>Let your child know you understand that taking chances is a normal part of growing up.</detail><detail>Remind your teen that drinking comes with serious risks.</detail><detail>Emphasize that your teen should never drink and drive or ride with a driver who has been drinking. </detail></h2><h2 title="How Problems at Home Might Influence Children to Drink"><text>
Risky drinking or alcohol use in the home can lead to the same habits in children. At an early age, children become aware of the drinking patterns of their parents. </text><text>Children are more likely to drink if: </text><detail>Conflict is present between parents or caregivers</detail><detail>Parents are having money problems or are stressed from work</detail><detail>Abuse is occurring at home or the home does not feel safe in other ways </detail><text>If alcohol use runs in the family, it is very important to talk with your child. DO NOT keep secrets. Your child should know what the risks of drinking are. Talk honestly about how drinking has affected family members and talk about the effects of alcohol on your own life. </text><text>Set a good example by drinking responsibly. If you have a problem with alcohol use, get help quitting. </text></h2><h2 title="Get Help for Your Child"><text>If you think your child is drinking but will not talk with you about it, get help. Your child's health care provider may be a good place to start. Other resources include: </text><detail>Local hospitals</detail><detail>Public or private mental health agencies</detail><detail>Counselors at your child's school</detail><detail>Student health centers</detail><detail>Programs such as Alateen, part of the Al-Anon program -- al-anon.org/for-members/group-resources/alateen</detail></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>Alcohol use - teenager; Alcohol abuse - teenager; Problem drinking - teenager; Alcoholism - teenager; Underage drinking - teenager</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 4/15/2018"><text>Updated by: Linda J.

<item><title>Talking to your child about smoking</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000873.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>Parents can have a big influence on whether their kids smoke. Your attitudes and opinions about smoking set an example. Talk openly about the fact that you do not approve of your child smoking. You can also help them think about how to say no if someone offers them a cigarette.</text></h2><h2 title="Why Children Start Smoking"><text>Middle school marks the beginning of many social, physical, and emotional changes. Kids become more prone to bad decisions based on what their friends say and do.</text><text>Most adult smokers had their first cigarette by the age of 11 and were hooked by the time they turned 14. </text><text>There are laws against marketing cigarettes to kids. Unfortunately, this does not stop kids from seeing images in ads and movies that make smokers look cool. Coupons, free samples, and promotions on cigarette companies' websites make cigarettes easier for kids to get. </text></h2><h2 title="How to Talk with Your Child About Smoking"><text>Start early. It is a good idea to start talking with your children about the dangers of cigarettes when they are 5 or 6 years old. Keep the conversation going as your children get older.</text><text>Make it a two-way talk. Give your children a chance to speak openly, particularly as they get older. Ask them if they know people who smoke and how they feel about it. </text><text>Stay connected. Studies show that kids who feel close to their parents are less likely to start smoking than kids who are not close to their parents. </text><text>Be clear about your rules and expectations. Kids who know their parents are paying attention and disapprove of smoking are less likely to start. </text><text>Talk about the risks of tobacco. Kids might think they do not have to worry about things like cancer and heart disease until they get older. Let your children know that smoking can affect their health right away. It can also affect other areas of their life. Explain these risks:</text><detail>Breathing problems. By senior year, kids who smoke are more likely to become short of breath, have coughing fits, wheeze, and get sick more often than kids who never smoked. Smoking also makes kids more prone to asthma.</detail><detail>Addiction. Explain that cigarettes are made to be as addicting as possible. Tell kids that they will have a very hard time quitting if they start to smoke.</detail><detail>Money. Cigarettes are expensive. Have your child figure out how much it would cost to buy a pack a day for 6 months, and what they could buy with that money instead.</detail><detail>Smell. Long after a cigarette is gone, the smell lingers on the smoker's breath, hair, and clothes. Because they are used to the smell of cigarettes, smokers can stink of smoke and not even know it. </detail><text>Know your kids' friends. As kids get older, their friends influence their choices more. The risk your children will smoke goes up if their friends smoke.</text></h2><h2 title="How to Prevent Future Smokers"><text>Talk about how the tobacco industry targets kids. Cigarette companies spend billions of dollars each year to try to get people to smoke. Ask your children if they want to support companies that make products that make people sick. </text><text>Help your child practice saying no. If a friend offers your children a cigarette, what will they say? Suggest responses like:</text><detail>"I do not want to smell like an ashtray."</detail><detail>"I do not want tobacco companies making money off of me."</detail><detail>"I do not want to be out of breath at soccer practice." </detail><text>Get your child involved in non-smoking activities. Playing sports, taking dance, or being involved in school or church groups can help reduce the risk that your child will start smoking.</text><text>Be savvy about "smoke-free" alternatives. Some kids have turned to smokeless tobacco or electronic cigarettes. They may think these are ways to dodge the dangers of cigarettes and still get a nicotine fix. Let your kids know this is not true.</text><detail>Smokeless tobacco ("chew") is addictive and has almost 30 cancer-causing chemicals. Kids who chew tobacco are at risk of cancer.</detail><detail>Electronic cigarettes, also known as vaping and electronic hookahs, are new to the market. They have come in flavors like bubble gum and pina colada that appeal to kids.</detail><detail>Many e-cigarettes contain nicotine. Experts worry that e-cigarettes will increase the number of kids who get addicted and smoke cigarettes as adults. </detail></h2><h2 title="When to Contact a Medical Professional"><text>If your child smokes and needs help quitting, talk to your health care provider.</text></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>Nicotine - talking to your child; Tobacco - talking to your children; Cigarettes - talking to your child</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 8/3/2018"><text>Updated by: Linda J.

It is important that you take warfarin exactly as you have been told. Changing how you take your warfarin, taking other medicines, and eating certain foods all can change the way warfarin works in your body. If this happens, you may be more likely to form a clot or have bleeding problems.</text></h2><h2 title="What to Expect at Home"><text>Warfarin is a medicine that makes your blood less likely to form clots. This may be important if:</text><detail>You have already had blood clots in your leg, arm, heart, or brain.</detail><detail>Your health care provider is worried that a blood clot may form in your body. People who have a new heart valve, a large heart, a heart rhythm that is not normal, or other heart problems may need to take warfarin. </detail><text>When you are taking warfarin, you may be more likely to bleed, even from activities you have always done.</text><text>Changing how you take your warfarin, taking other medicines, and eating certain foods all can change the way warfarin works in your body. If this happens, you may be more likely to form a clot or have bleeding problems.</text></h2><h2 title="Taking Warfarin"><text>It is important that you take warfarin exactly as you have been told. </text><detail>Take only the dose your provider has prescribed. If you miss a dose, call your provider for advice.</detail><detail>If your pills look different from your last prescription, call your provider or pharmacist right away. The tablets are different colors, depending on the dose. The dose is also marked on the pill. </detail><text>Your provider will test your blood at regular visits. This is called an INR test or sometimes a PT test. The test helps make sure you are taking the right amount of warfarin to help your body.</text><text>Alcohol and some medicines can change how warfarin works in your body.</text><detail>DO NOT drink alcohol while you are taking warfarin.</detail><detail>Talk with your provider before taking any other over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, supplements, cold medicines, antibiotics, or other drugs. </detail><text>Tell all of your providers that you are taking warfarin.

Always talk to the provider who prescribed the warfarin before stopping or changing your dose.</text><text>Ask about wearing a medical alert bracelet or necklace that says you are taking warfarin. This will let providers who take care of you in an emergency know that you are taking this drug.</text></h2><h2 title="Your Diet"><text>Some foods can change the way warfarin works in your body. Make sure you check with your provider before making any big changes in your diet.</text><text>You do not have to avoid these foods, but try to eat or drink only small amounts of them. In the least, DO NOT change much of these foods and products you eat day-to-day or week-to-week:</text><detail>Mayonnaise and some oils, such as canola, olive, and soybean oils</detail><detail>Broccoli, Brussels sprouts, and raw green cabbage</detail><detail>Endive, lettuce, spinach, parsley, watercress, garlic, and scallions (green onions)</detail><detail>Kale, collard greens, mustard greens, and turnip greens</detail><detail>Cranberry juice and green tea</detail><detail>Fish oil supplements, herbs used in herbal teas </detail></h2><h2 title="Other Tips"><text>Because being on warfarin can make you bleed more than usual:</text><detail>You should avoid activities that could cause an injury or open wound, such as contact sports.</detail><detail>Use a soft toothbrush, waxed dental floss, and an electric razor. Be extra careful around sharp objects. </detail><text>Prevent falls in your home by having good lighting and removing loose rugs and electric cords from pathways. DO NOT reach or climb for objects in the kitchen. Put things where you can get to them easily. Avoid walking on ice, wet floors, or other slippery or unfamiliar surfaces.</text><text>Make sure you look for unusual signs of bleeding or bruising on your body.</text><detail>Look for bleeding from the gums, blood in your urine, bloody or dark stool, nosebleeds, or vomiting blood.</detail><detail>Women need to watch for extra bleeding during their period or between periods.</detail><detail>Dark red or black bruises may appear.

<item><title>Taking narcotics for back pain</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000413.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>Narcotics are strong drugs that are sometimes used to treat pain. They are also called opioids. You take them only when your pain is so severe that you cannot work or do your daily tasks. They may also be used if other types of pain medicine do not relieve pain.</text><text>Narcotics can provide short-term relief of severe back pain. This can allow you to return to your normal daily routine.</text><text>Narcotics work by attaching themselves to pain receptors in your brain. Pain receptors receive chemical signals sent to your brain and help create the sensation of pain. When narcotics attach to pain receptors, the drug can block the feeling of pain. Even though narcotics can block the pain, they cannot cure the cause of your pain.</text></h2><h2 title="Names of Narcotics"><text>Narcotics include:</text><detail>Codeine</detail><detail>Fentanyl (Duragesic). Comes as a patch that sticks to your skin.</detail><detail>Hydrocodone (Vicodin)</detail><detail>Hydromorphone (Dilaudid)</detail><detail>Meperidine (Demerol)</detail><detail>Morphine (MS Contin)</detail><detail>Oxycodone (Oxycontin, Percocet, Percodan)</detail><detail>Tramadol (Ultram) </detail></h2><h2 title="Taking Narcotics"><text>Narcotics are called "controlled substances" or "controlled medicines." This means that their use is regulated by law. One reason for this is that narcotics can be addictive. To avoid narcotics addiction, take these drugs exactly as your health care provider and pharmacist prescribes.</text><text>DO NOT take narcotics for back pain for more than 3 to 4 months at a time. (This amount of time may even be too long for some people.) There are many other interventions of medications and treatments with good results for long term back pain.</text><text>How you take narcotics will depend on your pain. Your provider may advise you to take them only when you have pain. Or you may be advised to take them on a regular schedule if your pain is hard to control.</text><text>Some important guidelines to follow while taking narcotics include:</text><detail>DO NOT share your narcotic medicine with anyone.</detail><detail>If you are seeing more than one provider, tell each one that you are taking narcotics for pain. Taking too much can cause an overdose or addiction. You should only get pain medicine from one physician.</detail><detail>When your pain begins to lessen, talk with the provider you see for pain about switching to another kind of pain reliever.</detail><detail>Store your narcotics safely. Keep them out of reach of children and others in your home. </detail></h2><h2 title="Common Side Effects of Narcotics"><text>Narcotics can make you sleepy and confused. Impaired judgment is common. When you are taking narcotics, DO NOT drink alcohol, use street drugs, or drive or operate heavy machinery.</text><text>These medicines can make your skin feel itchy. If this is a problem for you, talk with your provider about lowering your dose or trying another medicine.</text><text>Some people become constipated when taking narcotics. If this happens, your provider may advise you to drink more fluids, get more exercise, eat foods with extra fiber, or use stool softeners. Other medicines can often help with constipation.</text><text>If the narcotic medicine makes you feel sick to your stomach or causes you to throw up, try taking your medicine with food. Other medicines can often help with nausea, as well.</text></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>Nonspecific back pain - narcotics; Backache - chronic - narcotics; Lumbar pain - chronic - narcotics; Pain - back - chronic - narcotics; Chronic back pain - low - narcotics</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 9/7/2017"><text>Updated by: C.

<item><title>Taking multiple medicines safely</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000883.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>If you take more than one medicine, it is important to take them carefully and safely. Some medicines can interact and cause side effects. It can also be hard to keep track of when and how to take each medicine.</text><text>Here are tips to help you keep track of your medicines and take them as directed.</text></h2><h2 title="Why you may Need More Than one Medicine"><text>You may take more than one medicine to treat a single condition. You may also take different medicines to treat more than one health problem. For example, you may take a statin to lower your cholesterol, and a beta-blocker to control your blood pressure.</text><text>Older adults often have more than one health condition. So they are more likely to take several medicines.</text></h2><h2 title="Risks of Taking Multiple Medicines"><text>The more medicines you take, the more you need to use them carefully. There are several risks when taking multiple medicines.</text><detail>You may be more likely to have side effects. Because most medicines can have side effects, the more medicines you take, the more likely you will have side effects. Taking certain medicines can also increase the risk for falls.</detail><detail>You are at higher risk for drug interactions. An interaction is when one medicine affects how another medicine works. For example, taken together, one medicine may make the other medicine stronger. Medicines can also interact with alcohol and even some foods. Some interactions can be serious, even life threatening.</detail><detail>You may find it hard to keep track of when to take each medicine. You even may forget which medicine you have taken at a certain time.</detail><detail>You may take a medicine you do not need. This may be more likely to happen if you see more than one health care provider. You may be prescribed different medicines for the same problem.</detail></h2><h2 title="People at Higher Risk"><text>Certain people are more likely to have problems from taking multiple medicines:</text><detail>People who are prescribed 5 or more medicines. The more medicines you take, the higher the chance of interactions or side effects. You may also find it hard to remember all possible drug interactions.</detail><detail>People who take medicines prescribed by more than one provider. One provider may not know that you are taking medicines another provider has given you.</detail><detail>Older adults. As you age, your body processes medicines differently. For instance, your kidneys may not work as well as they used to. This can mean that more medicine stays in your body for longer. This can lead to dangerous levels of medicines in your system.</detail><detail>People in the hospital. When you are in the hospital, you will likely see new providers who are not familiar with your health history. Without this knowledge, they may prescribe a medicine that may interact with medicines you already take. </detail></h2><h2 title="What you can do"><text>These suggestions can help you take all of your medicines safely:</text><detail>Keep a list of all medicines you take. Your list should include all prescription and over-the-counter (OTC) medicines. OTC medicines include vitamins, supplements, and herbal products. Keep a copy of the list in your wallet and at home.</detail><detail>Review your medicine list with your providers and pharmacists. Discuss the list with your provider each time you have an appointment. Ask your provider if you still need to take all of the medicines on your list. Also ask if any of the dosages should be changed. Make sure you give all of your providers a copy of your medicine list.</detail><detail>Ask questions about any new drugs you are prescribed. Make sure you understand how to take them. Also ask if a new medicine could interact with any of the medicines or supplements you are already taking.</detail><detail>Take your medicines exactly as your provider tells you. If you have questions about how or why to take your medicine, ask your provider. DO NOT skip doses, or stop taking your medicines.</detail><detail>If you notice side effects, tell your provider. DO NOT stop taking your medicines unless your provider tells you to.</detail><detail>Keep your medicines organized. There are many ways to keep track of your medicines. A pill organizer may help. Try one or more methods and see what works for you.</detail><detail>If you have a hospital stay, bring your medicine list with you. Talk with your provider about medicine safety while you are in the hospital.</detail></h2><h2 title="When to Call the Health Care Provider"><text>Call if you have questions or you are confused about the directions for your medicine. Call if you have any side effects from your medicines. DO NOT stop taking any medicine unless your provider tells you to stop.</text></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>Polypharmacy</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 8/4/2018"><text>Updated by: Linda J.

<item><title>Taking medicines to treat tuberculosis</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000425.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>Tuberculosis (TB) is a contagious bacterial infection that involves the lungs, but may spread to other organs. The goal of treatment is to cure the infection with medicines that fight the TB bacteria.</text></h2><h2 title="Why do you Need Medicines for TB?"><text>You may have a TB infection but no active disease or symptoms. This means the TB bacteria remain inactive (dormant) in a small area of your lungs. This type of infection may be present for years and is called latent TB. With latent TB:</text><detail>You cannot spread TB to other people.</detail><detail>In some people, the bacteria can become active. If this happens, you may become sick, and you can pass the TB germs to someone else.</detail><detail>Even though you do not feel sick, you need to take medicines to treat latent TB for 6 to 9 months. This is the only way to make sure all of the TB bacteria in your body are killed and you do not develop active infection in the future.</detail><text>When you have active TB, you may feel sick or have a cough, lose weight, feel tired, or have a fever or night sweats. With active TB:</text><detail>You can pass TB to people around you. This includes people you live, work, or come in close contact with.</detail><detail>You need to take many medicines for TB for at least 6 months to rid your body of the TB bacteria. You should begin to feel better within a month of starting the medicines.</detail><detail>For the first 2 to 4 weeks after starting the medicines, you may need to stay home to avoid spreading TB to others. Ask your health care provider when it is OK to be around other people.</detail><detail>Your provider is required by law to report your TB to the local public health department.</detail><text>Ask your provider if people you live or work with should be tested for TB.</text></h2><h2 title="How to Take the Medicines?"><text>TB germs die very slowly. You need to take several different pills at different times of the day for 6 months or longer. The only way to get rid of the germs is to take your TB medicines the way your provider has instructed. This means taking all of your medicines every day.</text><text>If you do not take your TB medicines the right way, or stop taking the medicines early:</text><detail>Your TB infection may become worse.</detail><detail>Your infection may become harder to treat. The drugs you are taking may no longer work. This is called drug-resistant TB.</detail><detail>You may need to take other medicines that cause more side effects and are less able to remove the infection.</detail><detail>You may spread the infection to others. </detail><text>If your provider is worried that you may not be taking all the medicines as directed, they may arrange to have someone meet with you every day or a few times a week to watch you take your TB drugs. This is called directly observed therapy.</text></h2><h2 title="Side Effects and Other Problems"><text>Women who may be pregnant, who are pregnant, or who are breastfeeding should talk to their provider before taking these medicines. If you are using birth control pills, ask your provider if your TB medicines can make birth control pills less effective.</text><text>Most people do not have very bad side effects from TB medicines. Problems to watch out for and tell your provider about include:</text><detail>Achy joints</detail><detail>Bruising or easy bleeding</detail><detail>Fever</detail><detail>Poor appetite, or no appetite</detail><detail>Tingling or aches in your toes, fingers, or around your mouth</detail><detail>Upset stomach, nausea or vomiting, and stomach cramps or pain</detail><detail>Yellow skin or eyes </detail><detail>Urine is the color of tea or is orange (orange urine is normal with some of the medicines)</detail></h2><h2 title="When to Call the Doctor"><text>Call your provider if you have:</text><detail>Any of the side effects listed above</detail><detail>New symptoms of active TB, such as cough, fever or night sweats, shortness of breath, or pain in the chest</detail></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>Tuberculosis - medicines; DOT; Directly observed therapy; TB - medicines</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 10/23/2017"><text>Updated by: Denis Hadjiliadis, MD, MHS, Paul F.

<item><title>Taking care of your vascular access for hemodialysis</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000591.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>You have a vascular access for hemodialysis. Taking good care of your access helps make it last longer.</text><text>Follow your health care provider's instructions on how to care for your access at home. Use the information below as a reminder.</text></h2><h2 title="What Is a Vascular Access?"><text>A vascular access is an opening made in your skin and blood vessel during a short operation. When you have dialysis, your blood flows out of the access into the hemodialysis machine. After your blood is filtered in the machine, it flows back through the access into your body. </text></h2><h2 title="Know What Type of Vascular Access You Have"><text>There are 3 main types of vascular accesses for hemodialysis. These are described as follows.</text><text>Fistula: An artery in your forearm is sewn to a vein nearby.</text><detail>This allows needles to be inserted into the vein for dialysis treatment.</detail><detail>A fistula takes from 1 to 4 months to heal before it is ready to use. </detail><text>Graft: An artery and a vein in your arm are joined by a U-shaped plastic tube under the skin.</text><detail>Needles are inserted into the graft when you have a dialysis.</detail><detail>A graft can be ready to use in 3 to 6 weeks. </detail><text>Central venous catheter: A soft plastic tube (catheter) is tunneled under your skin and placed in a vein in your neck, chest, or groin. From there, the tubing goes into a central vein that leads to your heart.</text><detail>A central venous catheter is ready to use right away.</detail><detail>It is usually used only for a few weeks or months. </detail></h2><h2 title="When You First Leave the Hospital"><text>You may have a little redness or swelling around your access site for the first few days. If you have a fistula or graft:</text><detail>Prop your arm on pillows and keep your elbow straight to reduce swelling.</detail><detail>You can use your arm after you get home from surgery. But, DO NOT lift more than 10 pounds (lb) or 4.5 kilograms (kg), which is about the weight of a gallon of milk. </detail><text>Taking care of the dressing (bandage):</text><detail>If you have a graft or fistula, keep the dressing dry for the first 2 days. You can bathe or shower as usual after the dressing is removed.</detail><detail>If you have a central venous catheter, you must keep the dressing dry at all times. Cover it with plastic when you shower. DO NOT take baths, go swimming, or soak in a hot tub. DO NOT let anyone draw blood from your catheter. </detail></h2><h2 title="Problems to Watch For"><text>


 
Grafts and catheters are more likely than fistulas to become infected. Signs of infection are redness, swelling, soreness, pain, warmth, pus around the site, and fever.</text><text>Blood clots may form and block the flow of blood through the access site. Grafts and catheters are more likely than fistulas to clot.</text><text>The blood vessels in your graft or fistula can become narrow and slow down the flow of blood through the access. This is called stenosis.

<item><title>Taking antacids</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000198.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>Antacids help to treat heartburn (indigestion). They work by neutralizing the stomach acid that causes heartburn.</text><text>You can buy many antacids without a prescription.

If you use antacids often and have problems with side effects, talk with your health care provider.</text></h2><h2 title="When to Use Antacids "><text>Antacids are a good treatment for heartburn that occurs once in a while. Take antacids about 1 hour after eating or when you have heartburn.

It is the small bone at the lower tip of the spine.</text><text>At home, be sure to follow your doctor's instructions on how to take care of your tailbone so that heals well.</text></h2><h2 title="More About Your Injury"><text>Most tailbone injuries lead to bruising and pain. Only in rare cases is there a fracture or broken bone.</text><text>Tailbone injuries are often caused by backward falls onto a hard surface, such as a slippery floor or ice.</text><text>Symptoms of a tailbone injury include:</text><detail>Pain or tenderness in the lower back</detail><detail>Pain on top of the buttocks area</detail><detail>Pain or numbness with sitting</detail><detail>Bruising and swelling around the base of the spine </detail></h2><h2 title="What to Expect"><text>A tailbone injury can be very painful and slow to heal. Healing time for an injured tailbone depends on the severity of the injury.</text><detail>If you have a fracture, healing can take between 8 to 12 weeks.</detail><detail>If your tailbone injury is a bruise, healing takes about 4 weeks.</detail><text>In rare cases, symptoms do not improve. Injection of a steroid medicine may be tried. Surgery to remove part of the tailbone may be discussed at some point, but not until 6 months or more after the injury.</text></h2><h2 title="Symptom Relief"><text>Follow these steps for the first few days or weeks after your injury:</text><detail>Rest and stop any physical activity that causes pain. The more you rest, the quicker the injury can heal.</detail><detail>Ice your tailbone for about 20 minutes every hour while awake for the first 48 hours, then 2 to 3 times a day. DO NOT apply ice directly to the skin.</detail><detail>Use a cushion or gel donut when sitting. The hole in the center will take pressure off your tailbone. You can buy the cushion at a drugstore.</detail><detail>Avoid sitting a lot. When sleeping, lie on your belly to take pressure off the tailbone.</detail><text>For pain, you can use ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin, and others) or naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn, and others). You can buy these medicines without a prescription.</text><detail>DO NOT use these medicines for the first 24 hours after your injury. They may increase the risk of bleeding.</detail><detail>Talk with your health care provider before using these drugs if you have heart disease, high blood pressure, kidney disease, liver disease, or have had stomach ulcers or internal bleeding in the past.</detail><detail>DO NOT take more than the amount recommended on the bottle or more than your provider advises you to take. </detail><text>It may be painful to go to the bathroom.

Slowly increase your activities, such as walking and sitting. You should:</text><detail>Continue to avoid sitting for long periods.</detail><detail>Not sit on a hard surface.</detail><detail>Keep using the cushion or gel donut when sitting.</detail><detail>When sitting, alternate between each of your buttocks.</detail><detail>Ice after activity if there is any discomfort.</detail></h2><h2 title="Follow-up"><text>Your doctor may not need to follow up if the injury is healing as expected.

You must have a back-up tank of oxygen gas in case your power goes out. </detail><text>Portable, battery-operated concentrators are also available.</text></h2><h2 title="Ways to Breathe the Oxygen"><text>You will need other equipment to use your oxygen. One item is called a nasal cannula. This plastic tubing wraps over your ears, like eyeglasses, with 2 prongs that fit into your nostrils.</text><detail>Wash the plastic tubing once or twice a week with soap and water, and rinse it well.</detail><detail>Replace your cannula every 2 to 4 weeks.</detail><detail>If you get a cold or the flu, change the cannula when you're all better.</detail><text>You may need an oxygen mask. The mask fits over the nose and mouth. It is best for when you need higher amounts of oxygen or when your nose gets too irritated from the nasal cannula.</text><detail>Replace your mask every 2 to 4 weeks.</detail><detail>If you get a cold or the flu, change the mask when you're all better.</detail><text>Some people may need a transtracheal catheter.

They can help during an emergency.</text></h2><h2 title="Using Oxygen"><text>Using oxygen may make your lips, mouth, or nose dry. Keep them moist with aloe vera or a water-based lubricant, such as K-Y Jelly. DO NOT use oil-based products, such as petroleum jelly (Vaseline).</text><text>Ask your oxygen equipment provider about foam cushions to protect your ears from the tubing.</text><text>DO NOT stop or change your flow of oxygen. Talk with your provider if you think you are not getting the right amount. </text><text>Take good care of your teeth and gums.</text><text>Keep your oxygen far away from open fire (like a gas stove) or any other heating source.</text></h2><h2 title="Travel and Oxygen"><text>Make sure oxygen will be available for you during your trip.

<item><title>Using over-the-counter medicines safely</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000882.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>Over-the-counter (OTC) medicines are drugs you can buy without a prescription. They treat a variety of minor health conditions. Most OTC medicines are not as strong as what you can get with a prescription. But that does not mean they are without risk. In fact, not using the OTC medicines safely can lead to serious health problems.</text><text>Here is what you need to know about OTC drugs.</text></h2><h2 title="About OTC Medicines"><text>You can buy OTC medicines without a prescription in:</text><detail>Drug stores</detail><detail>Grocery stores</detail><detail>Discount and department stores</detail><detail>Convenience stores</detail><detail>Some gas stations </detail><text>When used properly, OTC medicines can help protect your health by:</text><detail>Relieving symptoms such as pain, coughing, or diarrhea</detail><detail>Preventing problems like heartburn or motion sickness</detail><detail>Treating conditions such as athletes foot, allergies, or migraine headaches</detail><detail>Providing first aid </detail></h2><h2 title="When Should you use OTC Medicines"><text>It is fine to use OTC medicines for most minor health problems or illnesses. If you are not sure, ask your health care provider or your pharmacist. Your provider can tell you:</text><detail>Whether an OTC medicine is right for your condition</detail><detail>How the medicine might interact with other medicines you take</detail><detail>What side effects or problems to watch for</detail><text>Your pharmacist can answer questions such as:</text><detail>What the medicine will do</detail><detail>How it should be stored</detail><detail>Whether another medicine might work as well or better</detail></h2><h2 title="What the Label can Tell you"><text>You can also get information about OTC drugs on the medicine label.</text><text>Most OTC medicines have the same kind of label, and soon all of them will. That means whether you buy a box of cough drops or a bottle of aspirin you will always know where to find information you need.</text><text>Here is what the label will show you:</text><detail>Active Ingredient. This tells you the name of the medicine you are taking and how much is in each dose.</detail><detail>Uses. The conditions and symptoms the medicine can treat are listed here. Unless your provider tells you otherwise, DO NOT use the medicine for any condition not listed.</detail><detail>Warnings. Pay close attention to this section. It tells you if you should talk with your provider before taking the medicine. For instance, you should not take certain antihistamines if you have a breathing problem like emphysema. The warnings also tell you about side effects and interactions. Some medicines you should not take when using alcohol or taking other medicines. The label will also tell you what to do in case of an overdose.</detail><detail>Directions. The label tells you how much medicine to take at one time, how often to take it, and how much is safe to take. This information is broken down by age group. Fully read the directions, because the dosage may be different for people of different ages.</detail><detail>Other Information. This includes such things as how to store the medicine.</detail><detail>Inactive Ingredients. Inactive means the ingredients should not have an effect on your body. Read them anyway so you know what you are taking.</detail><text>The label will also tell you the medicine's expiration date. You should dispose of it and not take it once that date has passed.</text></h2><h2 title="Other Ways to use OTC Medicines Safely"><text>You should:</text><detail>Examine the package before you buy it. Make sure it has not been tampered with.</detail><detail>Never use medicine you have bought that does not look the way you think it should or that is in a package that appears suspicious. Return it to the place you bought it.</detail><detail>Never take medicine in the dark or without glasses if you are unable to see clearly. Always be sure you are taking the right medicine from the right container.</detail><detail>Always tell your provider what medicines you take. This includes prescription and OTC medicines as well as herbals and supplements. Some prescription medicines will interact with OTC medicines. And some contain the same ingredients as OTC medicines, which means you could end up taking more than you should. </detail><text>Also be sure to take steps to keep kids safe. You can prevent accidents by keeping medicine locked up, out of reach, and out of sight. </text></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>OTC - using safely</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 8/4/2018"><text>Updated by: Linda J.

It may take a while to get used to this movement. Your provider will talk to you about how much weight you should put on your weak leg. Options include:</text><detail>Non weight-bearing. This means keep your weak leg off the ground when you walk.</detail><detail>Touch-down weight-bearing. You may touch the ground with your toes to help with balance. DO NOT bear weight on your weak leg.</detail><detail>Partial weight-bearing. Your provider will tell you how much weight you can put on the leg.</detail><detail>Weight-bearing as tolerated.

<item><title>Urostomy pouches and supplies</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000480.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>Urostomy pouches are special bags that are used to collect urine after bladder surgery.</text><detail>Instead of going to your bladder, urine will go outside of your abdomen into the urostomy pouch. The surgery to do this is called a urostomy.</detail><detail>Part of the intestine is used to create a channel for the urine to drain. It will stick outside your abdomen and is called the stoma. </detail><text>The urostomy pouch is attached to the skin around your stoma. It will collect the urine that drains out of your urostomy. The pouch is also called a bag or appliance.</text><text>The pouch will help:</text><detail>Prevent urine leaks</detail><detail>Keep the skin around your stoma healthy</detail><detail>Contain odor</detail></h2><h2 title="Types of Urostomy Pouches"><text>Most urostomy pouches come as either a 1-piece pouch or 2-piece pouch system. Different pouching systems are made to last different lengths of time. Depending on the type of pouch you use, it may need to be changed every day, every 3 days, or once a week. </text><text>A 1-piece system is made up of a pouch that has an adhesive or sticky layer on it. This adhesive layer has a hole that fits over the stoma.</text><text>A 2-piece pouch system has a skin barrier called a flange. The flange fits over the stoma and sticks to the skin around it. The pouch then fits onto the flange.</text><text>Both kinds of pouches have a tap or spout to drain the urine. A clip or another device will keep the tap closed when urine is not being drained. </text><text>Both types of pouch systems come with either of these:</text><detail>Precut holes in a range of sizes to fit different-size stomas</detail><detail>A starter hole that can be cut to fit the stoma </detail><text>Right after surgery your stoma will be swollen. Because of this, you or your health care provider must measure your stoma for the first 8 weeks after your surgery. As the swelling lessens, you will need smaller pouch openings for your stoma. These openings should not be more than 1/8th of an inch (3 mm) wider than your stoma. If the opening is too large, urine is more likely to leak or irritate the skin.</text><text>Over time, you may want to change the size or type of pouch you use. Weight gain or loss can affect what pouch works best for you. Children who use a urostomy pouch may need a different type as they grow. </text><text>Some people find that a belt gives extra support and makes them feel more secure. If you wear a belt, make sure it is not too tight. You should be able to get 2 fingers between the belt and your waist. A belt that is too tight could damage your stoma.</text></h2><h2 title="Buying and Storing Supplies"><text>Your provider will write a prescription for your supplies. </text><detail>You can order your supplies from an ostomy supply center, a pharmacy or medical supply company, or through mail order.</detail><detail>Contact your insurance company to find out if they will pay for part or all of your supplies. </detail><text>Try to keep your supplies together in one place and store them in an area that is dry and at room temperature. </text><text>Be careful about stocking up on too many supplies. Pouches and other devices have an expiration date and should not be used after this date. </text><text>Call your provider if you are having a hard time getting your pouch to fit right or if you notice changes to your skin or stoma. </text></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>Cystectomy - urostomy; Urostomy bag; Ostomy appliance; Urinary ostomy; Urinary diversion - urostomy supplies; Cystectomy - urostomy supplies; Ileal conduit</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 5/31/2018"><text>Updated by: Sovrin M.

The part that sticks outside your abdomen is called the stoma. </text><text>After a urostomy, your urine will go through your stoma into a special bag called a urostomy pouch. </text><text>Caring for your stoma and the skin around it is very important to prevent infection of your skin and kidneys. </text></h2><h2 title="About Your Stoma "><text>Your stoma is made from the part of your small intestine called the ileum. Your ureters are attached to the end of a small piece of your ileum. The other end becomes the stoma and is pulled through the skin of your abdomen.</text><text>A stoma is very delicate. A healthy stoma is pinkish-red and moist. Your stoma should stick out slightly from your skin. It is normal to see a little mucus. Spots of blood or a small amount of bleeding from your stoma is normal.</text><text>You should never stick anything into your stoma, unless your health care provider tells you to.</text><text>Your stoma has no nerve endings, so you will not be able to feel when something touches it. You also will not feel if it is cut or scraped. But you will see a yellow or white line on the stoma if it is scraped.</text></h2><h2 title="Caring for the Skin Around Your Stoma"><text>After surgery, the skin around your stoma should look like it did before surgery. The best way to protect your skin is by: </text><detail>Using a urostomy bag or pouch with the correct size opening, so urine does not leak</detail><detail>Taking good care of the skin around your stoma </detail><text>To care for you skin in this area:</text><detail>Wash your skin with warm water and dry it well before you attach the pouch.</detail><detail>Avoid skin care products that contain alcohol. These can make your skin too dry.</detail><detail>DO NOT use products on the skin around your stoma that contain oil. These can make it hard to attach the pouch to your skin.</detail><detail>Use special skin care products. This will make problems with your skin less likely. </detail><text>Be sure to treat any skin redness or skin changes right away, when the problem is minor. DO NOT allow the problem area to become larger or more irritated before asking your provider about it.</text><text>The skin around your stoma can become sensitive to the supplies you use, such as the skin barrier, tape, adhesive, or the pouch itself. This could happen slowly over time and not occur for weeks, months, or even years after using a product.</text><text>If you have hair on your skin around your stoma, removing it may help the pouch to more securely stay in place.</text><detail>Use trimming scissors, an electric shaver, or have laser treatment to remove the hair.</detail><detail>DO NOT use a straight edge or safety razor.</detail><detail>Be careful to protect your stoma if you remove hair around it.</detail></h2><h2 title="When to Call the Doctor"><text>Call your provider if you notice any of these changes in your stoma or the skin around it.</text><text>If your stoma:</text><detail>Is purple, gray, or black</detail><detail>Has a bad odor</detail><detail>Is dry</detail><detail>Pulls away from the skin</detail><detail>Opening gets big enough for your intestines to come through it</detail><detail>Is at skin level or deeper</detail><detail>Pushes farther out from the skin and gets longer</detail><detail>Skin opening becomes narrower</detail><text>If the skin around your stoma: </text><detail>Pulls back</detail><detail>Is red</detail><detail>Hurts</detail><detail>Burns</detail><detail>Swells</detail><detail>Bleeds</detail><detail>Is draining fluid</detail><detail>Itches</detail><detail>Has white, gray, brown, or dark red bumps on it</detail><detail>Has bumps around a hair follicle that are filled with pus</detail><detail>Has sores with uneven edges</detail><text>Also call if you:</text><detail>Have less urine output than usual</detail><detail>Fever</detail><detail>Pain</detail><detail>Have any questions or concerns about your stoma or skin</detail></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>Ostomy care - urostomy; Urinary diversion - urostomy stoma; Cystectomy - urostomy stoma; Ileal conduit</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 5/31/2018"><text>Updated by: Sovrin M.

<item><title>Urinary incontinence products - self-care</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000146.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>If you have problems with urinary incontinence (leakage), wearing special products will keep you dry and help you avoid embarrassing situations.</text></h2><h2 title="Choosing the Right Product "><text>First, talk with your health care provider to make sure the cause of your leakage cannot be treated.</text><text>If you have urine leakage, you can buy many types of urinary incontinence products. These products help keep your skin dry and prevent skin rashes and sores.</text><text>Ask your provider which product might be best for you. It depends on how much leakage you have and when it happens. You might also be concerned about cost, odor control, comfort, and how easy the product is to use.</text><text>You can always try another product if the one you are using is uncomfortable or does not keep you dry enough.</text><text>Your provider might ask you to drink less fluid throughout the day to cut down on leakage. Your provider may also recommend using the bathroom at regular, set times to help avoid accidents. Keeping a journal about when you have leakage problems can help your provider treat you.</text></h2><h2 title="Products for Men and Women "><text>You can wear disposable pads in your underwear. They have a waterproof backing that keeps your clothes from getting wet. Common brands are:</text><detail>Attends</detail><detail>Abena</detail><detail>Depends</detail><detail>Poise</detail><detail>Reassure</detail><detail>Serenity</detail><detail>Tena</detail><detail>Tranquility</detail><detail>Many different store brands</detail><text>Always change your pad or underwear regularly, even if you are dry. Changing often will keep your skin healthy. Set aside time to change 2 to 4 times a day at the same times every day.</text></h2><h2 title="Adult Diapers and Underwear"><text>You can use adult diapers if you are leaking large amounts of urine. You can buy the kind that you use once and throw away, or ones that you can wash and reuse. They come in different sizes. Wear a size that fits you snugly. Some have elastic around the legs to keep from leaking onto your clothes. Some come with a plastic cover for more protection.</text><text>Special, washable underwear are also available. These look more like regular underwear than adult diapers. Some have a waterproof crotch area and room for a pad or liner. Some are made out of a special waterproof fabric that keeps your skin dry. You do not need a pad with these.</text><text>Waterproof outer pants made of nylon, vinyl, or rubber are also available. They can be worn over your underwear.</text></h2><h2 title="Special Products for Men"><text>Men can use a drip collector for small amounts of urine leakage. This is a small pocket that fits over the penis. Wear close-fitting underwear to keep it in place.</text><text>Men can also use a condom catheter device. It fits over the penis like a condom. A tube carries the urine that collects in it to a bag attached to the leg. This helps to prevent odor and skin problems.</text></h2><h2 title="Special Products for Women"><text>Women can try different products, depending on the cause for their urine leakage. External devices include:</text><detail>Foam pads that are very small and fit between your labia. You take the pad out when you need to urinate, and then put a new one in. Common brands are Miniguard, UroMed, Impress, and Softpatch.</detail><detail>A urethra cap is a silicone cap, or shield that fits in place over your urinary opening. It can be washed and used again. Common brands are CapSure and FemAssist. </detail><text>Internal devices to prevent urine leakage include:</text><detail>A single-use plastic shaft that can be inserted into your urethra (hole where urine comes out) and has a balloon on one end and a tab on the other. It is only for single, short-term use and needs to be removed to urinate. Common brands are Reliance and FemSoft.</detail><detail>A pessary is a round latex or silicone disk that is inserted into your vagina to provide bladder support. It needs to be removed and washed on a regular basis. It must be fitted and prescribed by your primary care provider. </detail></h2><h2 title="Products to Protect Your Furniture"><text>You can buy special waterproof pads to put under your sheets and on your chairs. Sometimes these are called Chux or blue pads. Some pads are washable and can be reused. Others you use once and throw away.</text><text>You can also create your own pad from a vinyl tablecloth or shower curtain lining.</text></h2><h2 title="Where to Buy Products "><text>Many of these products are available over-the-counter (without a prescription) at your local drugstore or supermarket. You might have to check a medical supply store or search online for some products.</text><text>Remember, washable items may help save money.</text><text>Your insurance may pay for your pads and other incontinence supplies if you have prescription from your provider. Check with your insurance company to find out.</text></h2><h2 title="When to Call the Doctor"><text>Call your health care provider if:</text><detail>You are not sure how to use your product.</detail><detail>You are not staying dry.</detail><detail>You develop a skin rash or sores.</detail><detail>You have signs of infection (a burning sensation when you urinate, fever, or chills). </detail></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>Adult diapers; Disposable urinary collection devices</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 2/21/2017"><text>Updated by: Jennifer Sobol, DO, Urologist with the Michigan Institute of Urology, West Bloomfield, MI.

<item><title>Understanding your prostate cancer risk</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000931.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>Are you at risk for developing prostate cancer in your lifetime? Learn about the risk factors for prostate cancer. Understanding your risks can help you talk with your health care provider about what steps you may want to take.</text></h2><h2 title="Risk Factors"><text>No one knows what causes prostate cancer, but certain factors increase your risk of getting it.</text><detail>Age. Your risk increases as you get older. It is rare before 40 years old. Most prostate cancer occurs in men age 65 and older.</detail><detail>Family history. Having a father, brother, or son with prostate cancer increases your risk. Having one immediate family member with prostate cancer doubles a man's own risk. A man who has 2 or 3 first degree family members with prostate cancer is 11 times at greater risk than someone who has no family members with prostate cancer.</detail><detail>Race. African American men are at higher risk than men of other races and ethnicities. Prostate cancer may occur at a younger age, too.</detail><detail>Genes. Men with a BRCA1, BRCA2 gene mutation have a higher risk of prostate cancer and some other cancers. The role of genetic testing for prostate cancer is still being evaluated.</detail><detail>Hormones. Male hormones (androgens) like testosterone, may play a role in the development or aggressiveness of prostate cancer. </detail><text>A Western lifestyle is linked with prostate cancer, and dietary factors have been intensively studied. However, results are inconsistent.</text><text>Having risk factors for prostate cancer does not mean you will get it. Some men with several risk factors never get prostate cancer. Many men without risk factors develop prostate cancer.</text></h2><h2 title="How to Reduce Your Risk"><text>Most risks for prostate cancer, such as age and family history, cannot be controlled. Other areas are unknown or not yet proven. Experts are still looking at things like diet, obesity, smoking, and other factors to see how they may affect your risk.</text><text>As with many health conditions, staying healthy is your best defense against illness:</text><detail>DO NOT smoke.</detail><detail>Get plenty of exercise.</detail><detail>Eat a healthy low-fat diet with plenty of vegetables and fruits.</detail><detail>Maintain a healthy weight. </detail><text>It is a good idea to talk with your provider before taking dietary supplements. Some studies have shown that certain supplements may increase the risk for prostate cancer, although this is unproven:</text><detail>Selenium and vitamin E. Taken separately or together, these supplements may increase your risk.</detail><detail>Folic acid. Taking supplements with folic acid may increase your risk, but eating foods high in folate (a natural form of the vitamin) may help protect AGAINST prostate cancer.</detail><detail>Calcium. Getting high levels of calcium in your diet, either from supplements or dairy, may increase your risk. But you should talk with your provider before cutting back on dairy. </detail><text>It is a good idea to talk with your health care provider about your risk for prostate cancer and what you can do about it. If you have a higher risk, you and your provider can talk though the benefits and risks of prostate cancer screening to decide what is best for you.</text></h2><h2 title="When to Call the Doctor"><text>Call your health care provider if you:</text><detail>Have questions or concerns about your prostate cancer risk</detail><detail>Are interested or have questions about prostate cancer screening </detail></h2><h2 title="Review Date 1/31/2018"><text>Updated by: Todd Gersten, MD, Hematology/Oncology, Florida Cancer Specialists &amp;amp; Research Institute, Wellington, FL.

<item><title>Understanding your hospital bill</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000881.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>If you have been in the hospital, you will receive a bill listing the charges. Hospital bills can be complex and confusing. While it may seem hard to do, you should look closely at the bill and ask questions if you see something you do not understand. </text><text>Here are some tips for reading your hospital bill and suggestions for what to do if you find an error. Looking closely at your bill may help you save money.</text></h2><h2 title="Charges Listed on Your Hospital Bill"><text>A hospital bill will list the major charges from your visit. It lists the services you received (such as procedures and tests), as well as medicines and supplies. Most of time, you will get a separate bill for health care provider fees. It is a good idea to ask for a more detailed hospital bill with all of the charges described separately. That can help you make sure the bill is correct.</text><text>If you have insurance, you may also get a form from your insurance company, called an Explanation of Benefits (EOB). This is not a bill. It explains:</text><detail>What is covered by your insurance</detail><detail>Amount of payment made and to whom</detail><detail>Deductibles or coinsurance</detail><text>A deductible is the amount of money you must pay each year to cover your medical care expenses before your insurance policy starts to pay. Coinsurance is the amount you pay for medical care after you have met your health insurance deductible. It is often given as a percentage.</text><text>The information on the EOB should match your hospital bill. If it does not, or there is something you do not understand, call your insurance company.</text></h2><h2 title="Check Your Charges"><text>Errors on your medical bill can cost you money. So it is worth the time to check your bill. Check the following items carefully:</text><detail>Dates and number of days. Check that the dates on the bill match when you were in the hospital. If you were admitted after midnight, make sure the charges start on that day. If you are discharged in the morning, check that you are not charged for the full daily room rate.</detail><detail>Number errors. If a fee seems too high, check that there are no extra zeros added after a number (for example, 1,500 instead of 150).</detail><detail>Double charges. Make sure you are not billed twice for the same service, medicine, or supplies.</detail><detail>Medicine charges. If you brought your medicines from home, check that you were not charged for them. If a provider prescribed a generic drug, make sure you are not billed for the brand-name version.</detail><detail>Charges for routine supplies. Question charges for things such as gloves, gowns, or sheets. They should be part of the hospital's general costs.</detail><detail>Costs of reading tests or scans. You should be charged only once, unless you got a second opinion.</detail><detail>Cancelled work or medicines. Sometimes, a provider orders tests, procedures, or medicines that are later cancelled. Check that these items are not on your bill.</detail></h2><h2 title="A Fair Price"><text>If you had surgery or another procedure, it helps to know whether your hospital charged a fair price. There are some websites you can use to help you find this information. They use national databases of billed medical services. You enter the name of the procedure and your zip code to find an average or estimated price in your area.</text><detail>Healthcare Bluebook -- www.healthcarebluebook.com</detail><detail>FAIR Health -- www.fairhealth.org</detail><text>If the charge on your bill is higher than the fair price or higher than what other hospitals charge, you can use the information to ask for a lower fee.</text></h2><h2 title="Ask Questions"><text>If you do not understand a charge on your bill, many hospitals have financial counselors to help you with your bill. They can help explain the bill in clear language. If you find a mistake, ask the billing department to correct the error. Keep a record of the date and time you called, the name of the person you spoke to, and what you were told. </text><text>If you find an error and do not feel you are getting the help you need, consider hiring a medical-billing advocate. Advocates charge an hourly fee or a percentage of the amount of money you save as a result of their review.</text></h2><h2 title="Get Help Paying Your Bill"><text>If you cannot pay your bill in full before the due date, you may have options. Ask the hospital billing department if you can:</text><detail>Get a discount if you pay the full amount in cash</detail><detail>Work out a payment plan</detail><detail>Get financial aid from the hospital </detail></h2><h2 title="Review Date 8/3/2018"><text>Updated by: Linda J.

<item><title>Understanding your health care costs</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000878.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>All health insurance plans include out-of-pocket costs. These are costs that you have to pay for your care, such as copayments and deductibles. The insurance company pays the rest. You need to pay some out-of-pocket costs at the time of your visit. Others may be billed to you after your visit. </text><text>Out-of-pocket costs allow health plans to share medical costs with you. They can also help guide you to make good decisions about where and when to get care.</text><text>When you choose a health plan, you need to understand what your out-of-pocket costs may be. This way, you can plan ahead for what you may need to spend during the year. You also might be able to look for ways to save money on out-of-pocket costs.</text></h2><h2 title="Out-of-Pocket Costs"><text>The good news is there is a limit to how much you may have to pay out-of-pocket. Your plan has an "out-of-pocket maximum." Once you reach that amount, you will not have to pay any more out-of-pocket costs for the year.</text><text>You will still have to pay a monthly premium, no matter what services are used.</text><text>All plans are different. Plans may include all or only some of these ways to share costs with you:</text><detail>Copayment. This is the payment you make for certain health care provider visits and prescriptions. It is a set amount, like $15. Your plan may also include different copayment (copay) amounts for preferred vs. non-preferred drugs. This can range from $10 to $60 or more.</detail><detail>Deductible. This is the total amount you have to pay for medical services before your health insurance will start to pay. For example, you may have a plan with a $1,250 deductible. You will need to pay $1,250 out-of-pocket during the plan year before your insurance company will start to make payments.</detail><detail>Coinsurance. This is a percentage you pay for each visit or service. For example, 80/20 plans are common. For an 80/20 plan, you pay 20% of the cost for each service you receive. The plan pays the remaining 80% of the cost. Coinsurance may begin after you have paid your deductible. Keep in mind that your plan may have a maximum allowable limit for each cost of service. Sometimes providers charge more, and you may have to pay that extra amount as well as your 20%.</detail><detail>Out-of-pocket maximum. This is the maximum amount of co-pays, deductible, and coinsurance you will have to pay in a plan year. Once you reach your out-of-pocket maximum, the plan pays 100%. You will no longer have to pay coinsurance, deductibles, or other out-of-pocket costs.</detail></h2><h2 title="Services With Out-of-Pocket Costs"><text>In general, you do not pay anything for preventive services. These include vaccines, annual well visits, flu shots, and health screening tests.</text><text>You may need to pay some form of out-of pocket costs for:</text><detail>Emergency care</detail><detail>Inpatient care</detail><detail>Provider visits for an illness or injury, such as an ear infection or knee pain</detail><detail>Specialist care</detail><detail>Imaging or diagnostic visits, such as x-rays or MRIs</detail><detail>Rehab, physical or occupational therapy, or chiropractic care</detail><detail>Mental health, behavioral health, or substance abuse care</detail><detail>Hospice, home health, skilled nursing, or durable medical equipment</detail><detail>Prescription drugs</detail><detail>Dental and eye care (if offered by your plan)</detail></h2><h2 title="Ways to Save"><text>Choose the right type of health plan based on your location, health, and other preferences. Get to know your benefits, such as how they relate to emergency room visits and network providers.</text><text>Choose a primary care provider who helps guide you to only the tests and procedures you need. Also ask about lower-cost facilities and medicines.</text><text>Understanding your health care costs can help you save money when managing your care.</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 8/3/2018"><text>Updated by: Linda J.

<item><title>Understanding your cancer prognosis</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000926.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>Your prognosis is an estimate of how your cancer will progress and your chance of recovery. Your health care provider bases your prognosis on the type and stage of cancer you have, your treatment, and what has happened to people with cancer similar to yours. Many factors affect your prognosis. </text><text>For many types of cancer, the chance of recovery increases the more time passes after treatment. Knowing what to expect can be helpful for you and your family. Of course, how much information you want from your provider is up to you.</text></h2><h2 title="How Prognosis is Determined"><text>When deciding your prognosis, your provider will look at:</text><detail>Type and location of cancer</detail><detail>Stage and grade of cancer -- this is how abnormal the tumor cells are and how the tumor tissue looks under a microscope.</detail><detail>Your age and general health</detail><detail>Available treatments</detail><detail>How treatment is working</detail><detail>Outcomes (survival rates) of other people with your type of cancer </detail><text>Cancer outcomes are often described in terms of how many people survived 5 years after diagnosis and treatment. These rates are based on a specific type and stage of cancer. For example, a 93% 5-year survival rate for stage II breast cancer means that 93% of people diagnosed over a certain time lived for 5 years or more. Of course, many people live much longer than 5 years.</text><text>There are different types of statistics that doctors use to estimate survival rates. The statistics are based on data collected for many years about people who have the same type of cancer. </text><text>Because this information is based on a large group of people who were treated a number of years ago, it cannot always predict how things will go for you. Not everyone responds to treatment the same way. Also, there are newer treatments available today than when the data was collected. </text><text>The statistics can help predict how cancer responds to certain treatments. It can also pinpoint cancers that are harder to control. </text><text>So remember that when you receive a prognosis, it is not set in stone. It is your provider's best guess about how your treatment will go. </text></h2><h2 title="Why it May Help to Know Your Prognosis"><text>Knowing your prognosis can help you and your family make decisions about:</text><detail>Treatment</detail><detail>Palliative care</detail><detail>Personal matters such as finances </detail><text>Knowing what to expect may make it easier to cope and to plan ahead. It also may help give you more of a sense of control over your life. </text><text>Of course, some people prefer not to get a lot of detail about survival rates and so on. They may find it confusing or scary. That's fine too. You can choose how much you want to know.</text></h2><h2 title="Factors That Affect Prognosis"><text>Survival rates are based on information from thousands of people. You may have a similar or different outcome. Your body is unique, and no two patients are exactly alike. </text><text>Your recovery depends on how you respond to treatment and how easy or hard the cancer cells are to control. Other factors may also affect recovery, such as:</text><detail>Your physical and emotional health</detail><detail>Diet and exercise habits</detail><detail>Lifestyle factors, such as whether you smoke </detail><text>Remember that new treatments are being developed all the time. This increases the chance for a good outcome.</text></h2><h2 title="Remission vs Cure"><text>Being in complete remission after being treated for cancer means:</text><detail>There are no traces of cancer found when your doctor examines you.</detail><detail>Blood and imaging tests find no trace of cancer.</detail><detail>Signs and symptoms of cancer are gone. </detail><text>In partial remission, signs and symptoms are reduced but not totally gone. Some cancers can be controlled for months and even years.</text><text>A cure means that the cancer has been destroyed, and it will not come back. Most of the time, you need to wait a period of time to see if the cancer returns before considering yourself cured. </text><text>Most cancers that come back do so within 5 years after treatment has ended. If you have been in remission for 5 years or more, it is less likely that cancer may come back. Still, there can be cells that remain in your body and cause cancer to come back years later. You could also get another type of cancer. So your provider will continue to monitor you for many years.</text><text>No matter what, it is a good idea to practice cancer prevention and see your provider regularly for check-ups and screenings.

<item><title>Understanding your breast cancer risk</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000830.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>Breast cancer risk factors are things that increase the chance that you could get cancer. Some risk factors you can control, such as drinking alcohol. Others, such as family history, you cannot control.</text><text>The more risk factors you have, the more your risk increases. However, it does not mean you absolutely will get cancer. Many women who get breast cancer do not have any known risk factors or a family history.</text><text>Understanding your risk factors can give you a better picture of what you can do to help prevent breast cancer.</text></h2><h2 title="Risk Factors You Cannot Control"><text>Risk factors you cannot control include:</text><detail>Age. Your risk for breast cancer increases as you age. Most cancers are found in women age 55 and older.</detail><detail>Gene mutations. Changes in genes linked with breast cancer, such as BRCA1, BRCA2, and others increase your risk. Gene mutations account for about 10% of all breast cancer cases.</detail><detail>Dense breast tissue. Having more dense breast tissue and with less fat breast tissue increases risk. Also, dense breast tissue can make tumors hard to see on mammography.</detail><detail>Radiation exposure. Treatment involving radiation therapy to the chest wall as a child can increase your risk.</detail><detail>Family history of breast cancer. If your mother, sister, or daughter was diagnosed with breast cancer, you have a higher risk.</detail><detail>Personal history of breast cancer. If you have had breast cancer, you are at risk for breast cancer coming back.</detail><detail>Personal history of ovarian cancer.</detail><detail>Abnormal cells found during biopsy. If your breast tissue was examined in a lab and had abnormal features (but not cancer), your risk is higher.</detail><detail>Reproductive and menstrual history. Getting your period before age 12, starting menopause after age 55, getting pregnant after age 30, or never getting pregnant all increase your risk.</detail><detail>DES (Diethylstilbestrol). This is a drug given to pregnant women between 1940 and 1971. Women who took DES during pregnancy to prevent miscarriage have a slightly higher risk. Women exposed to the drug in the womb also have a slightly higher risk.</detail><detail>Race. White women are diagnosed with breast cancer more often than African American/Black, Hispanic/Latina, Asian/Pacific Islander, or American Indian/Alaska Native women. </detail></h2><h2 title="Risk Factors You Can Control"><text>Risk factors you can control include:</text><detail>Radiation therapy. Radiation therapy to the chest area before age 30 increases your risk.</detail><detail>Alcohol intake. The more alcohol you drink, the greater your risk.</detail><detail>Long-term use ofhormone therapy. Taking estrogen and progestin together for menopause for 5 years or more increases your risk. It is not clear if, or how much, taking birth control pills that contain estrogen increase your risk.</detail><detail>Weight. Overweight or obese women after menopause have a higher risk than women at healthy weights.</detail><detail>Physical inactivity. Women who do not exercise regularly throughout life may have an increased risk. </detail></h2><h2 title="How to Reduce Your Risk"><text>Just because you have risk factors you cannot control does not mean you cannot take steps to lower your risk. Start by making certain lifestyle changes and working with your health care provider. Here are some things you can do to lower your risk for breast cancer:</text><detail>Maintain a healthy weight.</detail><detail>Exercise at least 4 hours a week.</detail><detail>Avoid alcohol, or have no more than one alcoholic drink in a day.</detail><detail>If possible, limit or reduce radiation from imaging tests, especially during puberty.</detail><detail>Breastfeeding, if possible, may decrease your risk.</detail><detail>Talk with your provider about the risks and benefits before taking hormone therapy. You may want to avoid taking estrogen combined with progesterone or progestin.</detail><detail>If you have a family history of breast cancer, ask your provider about genetic testing.</detail><detail>If you are younger than age 50 and have a high risk for breast cancer, talk to your provider about medicines to reduce breast cancer risk by blocking or reducing estrogens in the body. They include tamoxifen, raloxifene, and aromatase inhibitors.</detail><detail>If you are at high risk, talk with your provider about preventive surgery to remove breast tissue (mastectomy). It can reduce your risk by as much as 90%.</detail><detail>Consider surgery to remove your ovaries. It will lower estrogen in the body and can reduce your risk for breast cancer by as much as 50%. </detail><text>Some areas are unknown or not yet proven. Studies are looking at things like smoking, diet, chemicals, and types of birth control pills. Talk to your provider if you are interested in joining a clinical trial for breast cancer prevention.</text></h2><h2 title="When to Call the Doctor"><text>You should call your provider if:</text><detail>You have questions or concerns about your breast cancer risk.</detail><detail>You are interested in genetic testing, preventive medicines, or treatments.</detail><detail>You are due for a mammogram.</detail></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>Carcinoma-lobular - risk; DCIS; LCIS - risk; Ductal carcinoma in situ - risk; Lobular carcinoma in situ - risk; Breast cancer - prevention</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 8/15/2016"><text>Updated by: Todd Gersten, MD, Hematology/Oncology, Florida Cancer Specialists &amp;amp; Research Institute, Wellington, FL.

<item><title>Understanding the DASH diet</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000784.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>The DASH diet is low in salt and rich in fruits, vegetable, whole grains, low-fat dairy, and lean protein. DASH stands for Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension. The diet was first created to help lower high blood pressure. It is also a healthy way to lose weight. </text></h2><h2 title="How it Works"><text>The DASH diet helps you eat nutritious foods.</text><text>This is not just a traditional low-salt diet. The DASH diet emphasizes foods high in calcium, potassium, and magnesium, and fiber, which, when combined, help lower blood pressure.</text><text>To follow the DASH diet for weight loss, you eat plenty of:</text><detail>Non-starchy vegetables and fruit </detail><text>You eat moderate portions of:</text><detail>Fat-free or low-fat dairy products</detail><detail>Whole grains</detail><detail>Lean meats, poultry, beans, soy foods, legumes, and eggs and egg substitutes</detail><detail>Fish</detail><detail>Nuts and seeds</detail><detail>Heart-healthy fats, such as olive and canola oil or avocados </detail><text>You should limit:</text><detail>Sweets and sugar-sweetened beverages</detail><detail>Foods high in saturated fats such as full- fat dairy, fatty meals, tropical oils, and most packaged snacks</detail><detail>Alcohol intake </detail><text>Your health care provider can help you figure out how many calories you need to eat each day. Your calorie needs are influenced by your age, gender, activity level, medical conditions, and whether or not you are trying to lose or maintain your weight. The "A Day With the DASH Eating Plan" helps you track how many servings of each type of food you can eat. There are plans for 1,200; 1,400; 1,600; 1,800; 2,000; 2,600; and 3,100 calories per day. DASH suggests smaller portions and healthy food swaps to aid weight loss.</text><text>You can follow an eating plan that allows for either 2,300 milligrams (mg) or 1,500 mg of salt (sodium) per day.</text></h2><h2 title="Off-Limit Foods"><text>When following the DASH plan, you should limit how much you eat of these foods:</text><detail>Foods with added salt (sodium) and adding salt to foods</detail><detail>Alcohol</detail><detail>Sugar-sweetened beverages</detail><detail>Foods high in saturated fats, such as whole fat dairy and deep-fried foods</detail><detail>Packaged snacks, which are often high in fat, salt, and sugar </detail><text>Before you increase the potassium in your diet or use salt substitutes (which often contain potassium), check with your provider. People who have kidney problems or who take certain medicines must be careful about how much potassium they consume.</text></h2><h2 title="The Role of Exercise"><text>DASH recommends at least 30 minutes of exercise a day, most days of the week. The important thing is to total at least 2 hours and 30 minutes per week of activities at a moderate-intensity level. Do exercises that get your heart pumping. To help prevent weight gain, exercise for 60 minutes a day. </text></h2><h2 title="Health Benefits"><text>The DASH diet has been widely studied and has many health benefits. Following this diet plan may help:</text><detail>Lower high blood pressure</detail><detail>Reduce the risk for heart disease, heart failure, and stroke</detail><detail>Help prevent or control type 2 diabetes</detail><detail>Improve cholesterol levels</detail><detail>Reduce the chance of kidney stones </detail><text>The National Heart, Blood, and Lung Institute helped develop the DASH diet. It is also recommended by:</text><detail>The American Heart Association</detail><detail>The 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans</detail><detail>U.S. guidelines for treatment of high blood pressure </detail></h2><h2 title="Possible Health Concerns"><text>Following this diet will provide all the nutrients you need. It is safe for both adults and children. It is low in saturated fat and high in fiber, an eating style that is recommended for everyone.</text><text>If you have a health condition, it is a good idea to talk with your doctor before starting this or any diet plan to lose weight. </text><text>On the DASH diet eating plan you will likely be eating a lot more of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. These foods are high in fiber and increasing your intake of fiber too quickly may cause GI discomfort. Slowly increase how much fiber you eat each day and be sure to drink plenty of fluids.</text></h2><h2 title="Ease of Use"><text>In general, the diet is easy to follow and should leave you feeling satisfied. You will be buying more fruits and vegetables than before, which may be more expensive than prepared foods. </text><text>The diet is flexible enough to follow if you are vegetarian, vegan, or gluten-free. </text></h2><h2 title="Where to Find More Information"><text>You can get started by going to the National Heart, Blood, and Lung Institute web page "What Is the DASH Eating Plan?" -- www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health-topics/dash-eating-plan. </text><text>You can also buy books about the DASH diet that include diet tips and recipes.</text></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>Hypertension - DASH diet; Blood-pressure - DASH diet</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 6/13/2018"><text>Updated by: Emily Wax, RD, The Brooklyn Hospital Center, Brooklyn, NY.

With Original Medicare, you have the option to also choose Plan D for your prescription medicines.</text></h2><h2 title="Part A - Medicare"><text>Medicare part A covers services and supplies needed to treat a disease or medical conditions and that take place during: </text><detail>Hospital care.</detail><detail>Skilled nursing facility care, when you are sent to recover from an illness or procedure. (Moving into nursing homes when you are no longer able to live at home is not covered by Medicare.)</detail><detail>Hospice care.</detail><detail>Home health visits. </detail><text>Services and supplies provided while in a hospital or a facility that may be included are:</text><detail>Care provided by physicians, nurses, and other health care providers</detail><detail>Drugs</detail><detail>Nursing care</detail><detail>Therapy to help with speech, swallowing, movement, bathing, dressing and so on</detail><detail>Lab and imaging tests</detail><detail>Surgeries and procedures</detail><detail>Wheelchairs, walkers, and other equipment </detail><text>Most people do not pay a monthly premium for Part A. </text></h2><h2 title="Part B - Medicare"><text>Outpatient care. Medicare Part B helps pay for treatments and services provided as an outpatient. Outpatient care may take place in:</text><detail>An emergency room or other area of the hospital, but when you are not admitted</detail><detail>A health care provider's offices (including doctor nurse, therapist, and others)</detail><detail>A surgery centers</detail><detail>A laboratory or imaging center</detail><detail>Your home </detail><text>Services and other health care providers. It also pays for preventive health care services, such as: </text><detail>Wellness visits and other preventive services, such as flu and pneumonia shots and mammograms</detail><detail>Surgical procedures</detail><detail>Lab tests and x-rays</detail><detail>Drugs and medicines that you are unable to give to yourself, such as medicines given through your veins</detail><detail>Feeding tubes</detail><detail>Visits with a provider</detail><detail>Wheelchairs, walkers, and some other supplies</detail><detail>And many more </detail><text>Most people pay a monthly premium for Part B. You also pay a small yearly deductible. Once that amount is met, you pay 20% of the cost for most services. This is called coinsurance. You also pay copayments for doctor visits. This is a small fee, usually about $25 or so, for each doctor or specialist visit.</text><text>Exactly what is covered in your area depends on:</text><detail>Federal and state laws</detail><detail>What Medicare decides is covered</detail><detail>What local companies decide to cover </detail><text>It's important to always check your coverage before using a service to find out what Medicare will pay for and what you may need to pay for.</text></h2><h2 title="Part C - Medicare Advantage "><text>Medicare advantage (MA) plans provide the same benefits as Part A, Part B, and part D. This means you are covered for medical and hospital care as well as prescription drugs. MA plans are offered by private insurance companies provided who work along with Medicare. </text><detail>You pay a monthly premium for this type of plan.</detail><detail>Typically you must use the doctors, hospitals, and other providers that work with your plan or you will pay more money. </detail><detail>MA plans cover all the services covered by Original Medicare (part A and part B).</detail><detail>They also offer additional coverage such as vision, hearing, dental, and prescription drug coverage. In some cases, you may need to pay extra for certain additional benefits such as dental care.</detail></h2><h2 title="Part D - Medicare Prescription Drug Plan "><text>If you have Original Medicare (parts A and B) and want prescription drug coverage, you must choose a Medicare Prescription Drug Plan (Plan D). This coverage is provided by private insurance companies approved by Medicare. </text><text>You cannot choose Plan D if you have a Medicare Advantage plan because drug coverage is provided by those plans.</text></h2><h2 title="Medigap"><text>Medigap is a Medicare supplemental insurance policy sold by private companies. It helps to pay costs like copayments, coinsurance, and deductibles. To get a Medigap policy you must have Original Medicare (part A and part B). You pay the private insurance company a monthly premium for your Medigap policy in addition to the monthly Part B premium that you pay to Medicare. </text></h2><h2 title="When to Sign Up for Medicare"><text>You should join Medicare Part A between 3 months before your birthday month (turning 65) and 3 months after your birthday month. You are given a 7 month window to join.</text><text>If you don't sign up for Part A within that window, you will pay a penalty fee to join the plan, and you may pay higher monthly premiums. Even if you are still working and will be covered by your work insurance, you need to sign up for Medicare Part A. So don't wait to join Medicare. </text><text>You can sign up for Medicare Part B when you first signed up for part A, or you can wait until you need that type of coverage. </text></h2><h2 title="When Choosing a Medigap, Medicare Advantage, or Medicare Part D Plan"><text>You can choose between original Medicare (Part A and Part B) or Medicare Advantage Plan (Part C). Most of the time, you can switch back and forth between these types of coverage at least once a year.</text><text>Decide if you want prescription drug coverage or Part D.

<item><title>Understanding health insurance plans</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000879.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>Most insurance companies offer different types of health plans. And when you are comparing plans, it can sometimes seem like alphabet soup. What is the difference between an HMO, PPO, POS, and EPO? Do they offer the same coverage?</text><text>This guide to health plans can help you understand each type of plan. Then you can more easily choose the right plan for you and your family.</text></h2><h2 title="Types of Health Insurance Plans"><text>Depending on how you get your health insurance, you may have a choice of different types of plans.</text><text>Health Maintenance Organizations (HMOs). These plans offer a network of health care providers and low monthly premiums. The providers have a contract with the health plan. This means they charge a set rate for services. You will choose a primary care provider. This person will manage your care and refer you to specialists. If you use providers, hospitals, and other providers from the plan's network, you pay less out of pocket. If you use providers outside of the network, you will have to pay more.</text><text>Exclusive Provider Organizations (EPOs). These are plans that offer networks of providers and low monthly premiums. You must use the providers and hospitals from the network list to keep your out-of-pocket costs low. If you see providers outside of the network, your costs will be much higher. With EPOs, you do not need a primary care provider to manage your care and give you referrals.</text><text>Preferred Provider Organizations (PPOs). PPOs offer a network of providers and the choice to see providers outside of the network for a bit more money. You do not need a primary care provider to manage your care. You will pay more in premiums for this plan compared to an HMO, but you have a bit more freedom to see providers inside and outside the network without the need for referrals.</text><text>Point-of-Service (POS) Plans. POS plans are like a PPO. They offer both in-network and out-of-network benefits. You can see any in-network providers without a referral. But you DO need a referral to see out-of-network providers. You may save some money in monthly premiums with this type of plan compared to a PPO.</text><text>High Deductible Health Plans (HDHPs). This type of plan offers low monthly premiums and high yearly deductibles. A HDHP may be one of the plan types above with a high deductible. A deductible is a set amount of money you have to pay before your insurance starts to pay. For 2015, HDHPs have a deductible of $1,300 per person and $2,600 per family per year or more. People with these plans often get a medical savings or reimbursement account. This helps you save money for the deductible and other out-of-pocket costs. It can also help you save money on taxes.</text><text>Fee for service (FFS) plans are not as common today. These plans offer freedom to see any provider or hospital of your choice. The plan pays a set amount for each service, and you pay the rest. You do not need referrals. Sometimes, you pay for the service up front, file a claim, and the plan reimburses you. This is a costly health insurance plan when it does not include a network or PPO option.</text><text>Catastrophic plans offer benefits for basic services and major illness or injury. They protect you from the cost of a major accident or illness. These plans do not have good coverage for people with health problems who need regular care or tests. You can only buy a catastrophic plan if you are under age 30 years or can prove you cannot afford health coverage. The monthly premiums are low, but the deductibles for these plans are quite high. As an individual, your deductible may be about $6,000. You will need to pay the high deductible before the insurance starts paying.</text></h2><h2 title="What is Right for me?"><text>When choosing a plan, think about your medical needs and preferences. In addition to the plan type, make sure you compare the benefits, out-of-pocket costs, and provider network for a good fit.</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 8/3/2018"><text>Updated by: Linda J.

<item><title>Understanding cardiovascular disease</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000759.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>Cardiovascular disease is the broad term for problems with the heart and blood vessels. These problems are often due to atherosclerosis. This condition occurs when fat and cholesterol build up in blood vessel (artery) walls. This buildup is called plaque. Over time, plaque can narrow blood vessels and cause problems throughout the body. If an artery becomes blocked, it can lead to heart attack or stroke.</text></h2><h2 title="Types of Cardiovascular Disease"><text>Coronary heart disease (CHD) is the most common type of heart disease, is when plaque builds up in the arteries leading to the heart. CHD is also called coronary artery disease (CAD). When arteries narrow, the heart cannot get enough blood and oxygen. A blocked artery can cause a heart attack. Over time, CHD can weaken the heart muscle and cause heart failure or arrhythmias.</text><text>Heart failure occurs when the heart muscle becomes stiff or weak. It cannot pump out enough oxygen-rich blood, which causes symptoms throughout the body. The condition may affect only the right side or only the left side of the heart. More often, both sides of the heart are involved. High blood pressure and CAD are common causes of heart failure.</text><text>Arrhythmias are problems with heart rate (pulse) or heart rhythm. This happens when the heart's electrical system doesn't work properly. The heart may beat too fast, too slow, or unevenly. Certain heart problems, such as heart attack or heart failure can cause problems with the heart's electrical system. Some people are born with an arrhythmia.</text><text>Heart valve diseases occur when one of the four valves in the heart does not work properly. Blood can leak through the valve in the wrong direction (called regurgitation), or a valve may not open far enough and block blood flow (called stenosis). An unusual heartbeat, called a heart murmur, is the most common symptom. Certain heart problems, such as heart attack, heart disease, or infection, can cause heart valve diseases. Some people are born with heart valve problems.</text><text>Peripheral artery disease occurs when the arteries to your legs and feet become narrow due to a buildup of plaque. Narrow arteries reduce or block blood flow. When blood and oxygen can't get to the legs, it can injure nerves and tissue.</text><text>High blood pressure (hypertension)is a cardiovascular disease that can lead to other problems, such as heart attack, heart failure, and stroke.</text><text>Stroke is caused by a lack of blood flow to the brain. This can happen because of a blood clot traveling to the blood vessels in the brain, or bleeding in the brain. Stoke has many of the same risk factors as heart disease.</text><text>Congenital heart disease is a problem with the heart's structure and function that is present at birth. Congenital heart disease can describe a number of different problems affecting the heart. It is the most common type of birth defect.</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 2/22/2018"><text>Updated by: Michael A.

<item><title>Understanding cancer staging</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000850.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>Cancer staging is a way to describe how much cancer is in your body and where it is located in your body. Staging helps determine where the original tumor is, how big it is, whether it has spread, and where it has spread.</text><text>Cancer staging can help your health care provider:</text><detail>Determine your prognosis (chance of recovery or likelihood the cancer will come back)</detail><detail>Plan your treatment</detail><detail>Identify clinical trials you may be able to join</detail><text>Staging also gives providers a common language to use to describe and discuss cancer.</text></h2><h2 title="How Cancer Is Staged"><text>Cancer is the uncontrolled growth of abnormal cells in the body. These cells often form a tumor. This tumor can grow into the surrounding tissues and organs. As the cancer progresses, cancer cells from the tumor can break away and spread to other parts of the body through the bloodstream or lymph system. When cancer spreads, tumors can form in other organs and parts of the body. The spread of cancer is called metastasis.</text><text>Cancer staging is used to help describe the progression of cancer. It helps determine:</text><detail>Location of the primary (original) tumor and type of cancer cells</detail><detail>Size of the primary tumor</detail><detail>Whether the cancer has spread to lymph nodes</detail><detail>Number of tumors from the cancer that has spread</detail><detail>Tumor grade (how much cancer cells look like normal cells)</detail><text>To assess your cancer, your provider may perform different tests, depending on where the cancer is in your body. These may include:</text><detail>Imaging tests, such as x-rays, CT scans, PET scans, or MRIs</detail><detail>Lab tests</detail><detail>Biopsy</detail><text>You also may have surgery to remove the cancer and lymph nodes or to explore the cancer in your body and take a tissue sample. These samples are tested and can provide more detailed information about the cancer stage.</text></h2><h2 title="TNM Staging System"><text>The most common system for staging cancer in the form of solid tumor is the TNM system. Most providers and cancer centers use it to stage most cancers. The TNM system is based on:</text><detail>The size of the primary tumor (T)</detail><detail>How much cancer has spread to nearby lymph nodes (N)</detail><detail>Metastasis (M), or if and how much the cancer has spread to other areas in the body </detail><text>Numbers are added to each category that explains the size of the tumor and how much it has spread. The higher the number, the greater the size and the more likely cancer has spread.</text><text>Primary Tumor (T):</text><detail>TX: The tumor cannot be measured.</detail><detail>T0: The tumor cannot be found.</detail><detail>Tis: Abnormal cells have been found, but have not spread. This is called carcinoma in situ.</detail><detail>T1, T2, T3, T4: Indicate the size of the primary tumor and how much it has spread into surrounding tissue. </detail><text>Lymph Nodes (N):</text><detail>NX: Lymph nodes cannot be evaluated</detail><detail>N0: No cancer found in nearby lymph nodes</detail><detail>N1, N2, N3: Number and location of lymph nodes involved where cancer has spread </detail><text>Metastasis (M):</text><detail>MX: Metastasis cannot be evaluated</detail><detail>M0: No metastasis found (cancer has not spread)</detail><detail>M1: Metastasis is found (cancer has spread to other parts of the body) </detail><text>As an example, a bladder cancer T3 N0 M0 means there is a large tumor (T3) that has not spread to lymph nodes (N0) or anywhere else in the body (M0).</text><text>Sometimes other letters and sub-categories are used in addition to the ones above.</text><text>A tumor grade, such as G1-G4 can also be used along with staging. This describes how much cancer cells look like normal cells under a microscope. Higher numbers indicate abnormal cells. The less the cancer looks like normal cells, the faster it will grow and spread.</text><text>Not all cancers are staged using the TNM system. This is because some cancers, especially blood and bone marrow cancer such as leukemia, do not form tumors or spread in the same way. So other systems are used to stage these cancers.</text></h2><h2 title="Assigning a Stage"><text>A stage is assigned to your cancer based on the TNM values and other factors. Different cancers are staged differently. For instance, stage III colon cancer is not the same as a stage III bladder cancer. In general, a higher stage refers to more advanced cancer.</text><detail>Stage 0: Abnormal cells are present, but have not spread</detail><detail>Stage I, II, III: Refer to size of tumor and how much cancer has spread to lymph nodes</detail><detail>Stage IV: Disease has spread to other organs and tissues</detail><text>Once your cancer has been assigned a stage, it does not change, even if the cancer does come back.

<item><title>Ventriculoperitoneal shunt - discharge</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000149.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>Your child has hydrocephalus and needed a shunt placed to drain excess fluid and relieve pressure in the brain. This buildup of brain and spinal cord fluid (cerebrospinal fluid, or CSF) and pressure causes the brain tissue to press (become compressed) against the skull. Too much pressure or pressure that is present too long can damage the brain tissue.</text><text>Your child had a cut (incision) behind the ear and a small hole drilled through the skull. A small cut was also made in the belly. A valve was placed underneath the skin behind the ear. One tube (catheter) was placed into the brain to bring the fluid to the valve. Another tube was connected to the valve and threaded underneath the skin down into your child's belly.</text></h2><h2 title="What to Expect at Home"><text>Any stitches or staples that you can see will be taken out in about 7 to 14 days.</text><text>All parts of the shunt are underneath the skin. At first, the area at the top of the shunt may be raised up underneath the skin. As the swelling goes away and your child's hair grows back, there will be a small raised area about the size of a quarter that is usually not noticeable.</text></h2><h2 title="Self-care "><text>DO NOT shower or shampoo your child's head until the stitches and staples have been taken out. Give your child a sponge bath instead. The wound should not soak in water until the skin is completely healed.</text><text>DO NOT push on the part of the shunt that you can feel or see underneath your child's skin behind the ear.</text><text>Your child should be able to eat normal foods after going home, unless the health care provider tells you otherwise.</text><text>Your child should be able to do most activities:</text><detail>If you have a baby, handle your baby the way you would normally. It is OK to bounce your baby.</detail><detail>Older children can do most regular activities. Talk with your provider about contact sports.</detail><detail>Most of the time, your child may sleep in any position. But, check this with your provider as each child is different. </detail><text>Your child may have some pain. Children under 4 years old may take acetaminophen (Tylenol). Children age 4 and older may be prescribed stronger pain medicines, if needed. Follow your provider's instructions or instructions on the medicine container, about how much medicine to give your child.</text></h2><h2 title="When to Call the Doctor "><text>The major problems to watch for are an infected shunt and a blocked shunt.</text><text>Call your child's provider if your child has:</text><detail>Confusion or seems less aware</detail><detail>Fever of 101°F (38.3°C) or higher</detail><detail>Pain in the belly that does not go away</detail><detail>Stiff neck or headache</detail><detail>No appetite or is not eating well</detail><detail>Veins on the head or scalp that look larger than they used to</detail><detail>Problems in school</detail><detail>Poor development or has lost a developmental skill previously attained</detail><detail>Become more cranky or irritable</detail><detail>Redness, swelling, bleeding, or increased discharge from the incision</detail><detail>Vomiting that does not go away</detail><detail>Sleep problems or is more sleepy than usual</detail><detail>High-pitched cry</detail><detail>Been looking more pale</detail><detail>A head that is growing larger</detail><detail>Bulging or tenderness in the soft spot at the top of the head</detail><detail>Swelling around the valve or around the tube going from the valve to their belly</detail><detail>A seizure </detail></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>Shunt - ventriculoperitoneal - discharge; VP shunt - discharge; Shunt revision - discharge; Hydrocephalus shunt placement - discharge</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 7/4/2016"><text>Updated by: Amit M.

<item><title>Venous ulcers - self-care</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000744.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>Venous ulcers (open sores) can occur when the veins in your legs do not push blood back up to your heart as well as they should. Blood backs up in the veins, building up pressure. If not treated, increased pressure and excess fluid in the affected area can cause an open sore to form.</text><text>Most venous ulcers occur on the leg, above the ankle. This type of wound can be slow to heal.</text></h2><h2 title="Causes"><text>The cause of venous ulcers is high pressure in the veins of the lower leg. The veins have one-way valves that keep blood flowing up toward your heart. When these valves become weak or the veins become scarred and blocked, blood can flow backward and pool in your legs. This is called venous insufficiency. This leads to the high pressure in the lower leg veins. The increase in pressure and buildup of fluid prevents nutrients and oxygen from getting to tissues. The lack of nutrients causes cells to die, damaging the tissue, and a wound can form.</text></h2><h2 title="Signs and Symptoms"><text>When blood pools in the veins of the lower leg, fluid and blood cells leak out into the skin and other tissues. This can cause itchy, thin skin and lead to skin changes called stasis dermatitis. This is an early sign of venous insufficiency.</text><text>Other early signs include:</text><detail>Leg swelling, heaviness, and cramping</detail><detail>Dark red, purple, brown, hardened skin (this is a sign that blood is pooling)</detail><detail>Itching and tingling </detail><text>Signs and symptoms of venous ulcers include:</text><detail>Shallow sore with a red base, sometimes covered by yellow tissue</detail><detail>Unevenly shaped borders</detail><detail>Surrounding skin may be shiny, tight, warm or hot, and discolored</detail><detail>Leg pain</detail><detail>If the sore becomes infected, it may have a bad odor and pus may drain from the wound </detail></h2><h2 title="Who is At Risk?"><text>Risk factors for venous ulcers include:</text><detail>Varicose veins</detail><detail>History of blood clots in the legs (deep vein thrombosis)</detail><detail>Blockage of the lymph vessels, which causes fluid to build up in the legs</detail><detail>Older age, being female, or being tall</detail><detail>Family history of venous insufficiency</detail><detail>Obesity</detail><detail>Pregnancy</detail><detail>Smoking</detail><detail>Sitting or standing for a long periods (usually for work)</detail><detail>Fracture of a long bone in the leg or other serious injuries, such as burns or muscle damage </detail></h2><h2 title="Wound Care"><text>Your health care provider will show you how to care for your wound. The basic instructions are:</text><detail>Always keep the wound clean and bandaged to prevent infection.</detail><detail>Your provider will tell you how often you need to change the dressing.</detail><detail>Keep the dressing and the skin around it dry. Try not to get healthy tissue around the wound too wet. This can soften the health tissue, causing the wound to get bigger.</detail><detail>Before applying a dressing, cleanse the wound thoroughly according to your provider's instructions.</detail><detail>Protect the skin around the wound by keeping it clean and moisturized.</detail><detail>You will wear a compression stocking or bandages over the dressing. Your provider will show you how to apply the bandages. </detail><text>To help treat a venous ulcer, the high pressure in the leg veins needs to be relieved.</text><detail>Wear compression stockings or bandages every day as instructed. They help prevent blood from pooling, reduce swelling, help with healing, and reduce pain.</detail><detail>Put your feet above your heart as often as possible. For example, you can lie down with your feet propped up on pillows.</detail><detail>Take a walk or exercise every day. Being active helps improve blood flow.</detail><detail>Take medicines as directed to help with healing.</detail><text>If ulcers DO NOT heal well, your provider may recommend certain procedures or surgery to improve blood flow through your veins.</text></h2><h2 title="Prevention"><text>If you are at risk for venous ulcers, take the steps listed above under Wound Care. Also, check your feet and legs every day: the tops and bottoms, ankles, and heels. Look for cracks and changes in skin color.</text><text>Lifestyle changes can help prevent venous ulcers. The following measures may help improve blood flow and aid healing.</text><detail>Quit smoking. Smoking is bad for your blood vessels.</detail><detail>If you have diabetes, keep your blood sugar level under control. This will help you heal faster.</detail><detail>Exercise as much as you can. Staying active helps with blood flow.</detail><detail>Eat healthy foods and get plenty of sleep at night.</detail><detail>Lose weight if you are overweight.</detail><detail>Manage your blood pressure and cholesterol levels. </detail></h2><h2 title="When to Call the Doctor"><text>Call your provider if there are any signs of infection, such as:</text><detail>Redness, increased warmth, or swelling around the wound</detail><detail>More drainage than before or drainage that is yellowish or cloudy</detail><detail>Bleeding</detail><detail>Odor</detail><detail>Fever or chills</detail><detail>Increased pain</detail></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>Venous leg ulcers - self-care; Venous insufficiency ulcers - self-care; Stasis leg ulcers - self-care; Varicose veins - venous ulcers - self-care; Stasis dermatitis - venous ulcer</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 4/5/2018"><text>Updated by: Michael Sobel, MD, Professor of Vascular Surgery, University of Washington, Seattle, WA.

It can be caused by:</text><detail>Yeast, bacteria, viruses, and parasites</detail><detail>Bubble baths, soaps, vaginal contraceptives, feminine sprays, and perfumes (chemicals)</detail><detail>Menopause</detail><detail>Not washing well </detail></h2><h2 title="Self-care for Vaginitis"><text>Keep your genital area clean and dry when you have vaginitis.</text><detail>Avoid soap and just rinse with water to clean yourself.</detail><detail>Soak in a warm bath -- not a hot one.</detail><detail>Dry thoroughly afterward. Pat the area dry, don't rub. </detail><text>Avoid douching. Douching may worsen vaginitis symptoms because it removes healthy bacteria that line the vagina. These bacteria help protect against infection.</text><detail>Avoid using hygiene sprays, fragrances, or powders in the genital area.</detail><detail>Use pads and not tampons while you have an infection.</detail><detail>If you have diabetes, keep your blood sugar levels under control. </detail><text>Allow more air to reach your genital area.</text><detail>Wear loose-fitting clothes and not panty hose.</detail><detail>Wear cotton underwear (rather than synthetic), or underwear that has a cotton lining in the crotch. Cotton increases air flow and decreases moisture buildup.</detail><detail>DO NOT wear underwear at night when you sleep. </detail><text>Girls and women should also:</text><detail>Know how to properly clean their genital area while bathing or showering</detail><detail>Wipe properly after using the toilet -- always from front to back</detail><detail>Wash thoroughly before and after using the bathroom </detail><text>Always practice safe sex.

This medicine is a pill that you take once by mouth. </text><text>For more severe symptoms, you may need to use the yeast medicine for up to 14 days. If you have yeast infections often, your provider may suggest using medicine for yeast infections every week to prevent infections. </text><text>If you are taking antibiotics for another infection, eating yogurt with live cultures or taking Lactobacillus acidophilus supplements may help prevent a yeast infection. </text></h2><h2 title="When to Call the Doctor"><text>Call your provider if: </text><detail>Your symptoms are not improving</detail><detail>You have pelvic pain or a fever</detail></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>Vulvovaginitis - self-care; Yeast infections - vaginitis</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 4/19/2018"><text>Updated by: John D.

<item><title>Vaginal delivery - discharge</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000628.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>

 
You are going home after a vaginal birth. You may need help caring for yourself and your newborn. Talk to your partner, parents, in-laws, or friends.
</text></h2><h2 title="What to Expect at Home"><text>You may have bleeding from your vagina for up to 6 weeks. Early on, you may pass some small clots when you first get up. Bleeding will slowly become less red, then pink, and then you will have more of a yellow or white discharge. The pink discharge is called lochia.</text><text>In most cases, bleeding decreases the most during the first week. It may not stop completely for several weeks. It is not uncommon to have an increase in red bleeding around 7 to 14 days, when the scab forms over the spot where your placenta was shed.</text><text>Your menstrual period is likely to return in:</text><detail>4 to 9 weeks after your delivery if you're not breastfeeding.</detail><detail>3 to 12 months if you are breastfeeding, and perhaps not for several weeks after you completely stop breastfeeding.</detail><detail>If you choose to use a contraceptive, ask your provider the effect of the contraceptive on the return of your menses. </detail><text>You may lose up to 20 pounds (9 kilograms) over the first 2 weeks after having your baby. After that, weight loss of around one half pound (250 grams) per week is best. Your health care provider can explain more about losing weight after pregnancy.</text><text>Your uterus will be hard and round and can most often be felt near the navel shortly after birth. It will get smaller very quickly, and after a week will be difficult to feel abdominally. You may feel contractions for a few days. They are most often mild but can be stronger if you have already had several babies. Sometimes, they can feel like labor contractions.</text><text>If you are not breastfeeding, breast engorgement may continue for a few days.</text><detail>Wear a supportive bra 24 hours a day for the first 1 to 2 weeks.</detail><detail>Avoid any nipple stimulation.</detail><detail>Use ice packs to help with the discomfort.</detail><detail>Take ibuprofen to decrease pain and inflammation. </detail><text>You will need a checkup with your provider in 4 to 6 weeks.</text><text>Take tub baths or showers, using only plain water. Avoid bubble baths or oils.</text></h2><h2 title="Episiotomy Care "><text>Most women heal from an episiotomy or lacerations without problems, although it may take several weeks. Your stitches do not need to be removed. Your body will absorb them.</text><text>You can return to normal activities, such as light office work or house cleaning, and walking, when you feel ready. Wait 6 weeks before you:</text><detail>Use tampons</detail><detail>Have sex</detail><detail>Do impact exercises, such as jogging, dancing, or lifting weights </detail><text>To avoid constipation (hard stools):</text><detail>Eat a high-fiber diet with plenty of fruits and vegetables</detail><detail>Drink 8 cups (2 liters) of water a day to prevent constipation and bladder infections</detail><detail>Use a stool softener or bulk laxative (not enemas or stimulating laxatives) </detail><text>Ask your provider what you can do to relieve the discomfort and speed the healing of your episiotomy or lacerations.</text></h2><h2 title="Other Self-care "><text>Try eating smaller meals than normal and have healthy snacks in between.</text><text>Any hemorrhoids you develop should slowly decrease in size. Some may go away. Methods that may help your symptoms include:</text><detail>Warm tub baths</detail><detail>Cold compresses over the area</detail><detail>Over-the-counter pain relievers</detail><detail>Over-the-counter hemorrhoid ointments or suppositories (ALWAYS talk to your provider before using any suppositories) </detail><text>Exercise can help your muscles and improve your energy level. It can help you sleep better and relieve stress. It may help prevent postpartum depression. In general, it's safe to start gentle exercises a few days after a normal vaginal delivery -- or when you feel ready. Aim for 20 to 30 minutes a day at first, Even 10 minutes a day can help. If you feel any pain, stop exercising.</text><text>You can start sexual activity around 6 weeks after delivery, if the discharge or lochia has stopped.</text><text>Women who breastfeed may have a lower sex drive than normal, along with vaginal dryness and pain with intercourse. This is because breastfeeding lowers hormone levels. The same drop in hormones most often prevents your menstrual period from returning for many months.</text><text>During this time, use a lubricant and practice gentle sex. If sex is still difficult, talk with your provider. Your provider may recommend a hormone cream that can reduce your symptoms. These changes in your body are temporary. After you are done breastfeeding and your menstrual cycle returns, your sex drive and function should return to normal.</text><text>Talk with your provider about contraception after pregnancy before you leave the hospital. You may be able to get pregnant as soon as 4 weeks after having a baby. It is important to use effective contraception during this time.</text><text>In the days or even months after delivery, some moms feel sad, disappointed, tired, or withdrawn. Many of these feelings are normal, and they often will go away.</text><detail>Try talking with your partner, family, or friends about your feelings.</detail><detail>If these feelings do not go away or become worse, seek help from your provider. </detail><text>Pee often and drink plenty of fluids to avoid bladder infections.</text></h2><h2 title="When to Call the Doctor"><text>Call your provider if you have vaginal bleeding that is:</text><detail>Heavier than 1 pad per hour or you have clots that are bigger than a golf ball</detail><detail>Still heavy (like your menstrual period flow) after more than 4 days, except for the expected increase around 7 to 14 days for a day or so</detail><detail>Either spotting or bleeding and returns after going away for more than a few days </detail><text>Also call your provider if you have:</text><detail>Swelling or pain in one of your legs (it will be slightly redder and warmer than the other leg).</detail><detail>Fever more than 100°F (37.8°C) that persists (swollen breasts may cause a mild elevation of temperature).</detail><detail>Increased pain in your belly.</detail><detail>Increased pain over your episiotomy/laceration or in that area.</detail><detail>Discharge from your vagina that becomes heavier or develops a foul odor.</detail><detail>Sadness, depression, withdrawn feeling, feelings of harming yourself or your baby, or inability to care for yourself or your baby.</detail><detail>A tender, reddened, or warm area on one breast. This may be a sign of infection. </detail><text>Postpartum preeclampsia, while rare, can occur after delivery, even if you did not have preeclampsia during your pregnancy. Call your provider right away if you:</text><detail>Have swelling in your hands, face, or eyes (edema).</detail><detail>Suddenly gain weight over 1 or 2 days, or you gain more than 2 pounds (1 kilogram) in a week.</detail><detail>Have a headache that does not go away or becomes worse.</detail><detail>Have vision changes, such as you cannot see for a short time, see flashing lights or spots, are sensitive to light, or have blurry vision.</detail><detail>Body pain and achiness (similar to body pain with a high fever). </detail></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>Pregnancy - discharge after vaginal delivery</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 8/16/2018"><text>Updated by: John D.

Many women can have vaginal deliveries after having a C-section in the past. This is called a vaginal birth after cesarean (VBAC).</text></h2><h2 title="Why Should I Think About a VBAC? "><text>Most women who try VBAC are able to deliver vaginally. There are many good reasons to try a VBAC rather than have a C-section. Some are:</text><detail>Shorter stay in the hospital</detail><detail>Faster recovery</detail><detail>No surgery</detail><detail>Lower risk for infections</detail><detail>Less chance you will need a blood transfusion</detail><detail>You may avoid future C-sections -- a good thing for women who want to have more children</detail></h2><h2 title="What are the Risks?"><text>The most serious risk with VBAC is a rupture (break) of the uterus. Blood loss from a rupture can be a risk for the mom and can injure the baby.</text><text>Women who try VBAC and do not succeed are also more likely to need a blood transfusion. There is also a greater risk of getting an infection in the uterus. </text></h2><h2 title="Who can Have a VBAC?"><text>The chance of a rupture depends on how many C-sections and what kind you had before. You may be able to have a VBAC if you had only one C-section delivery in the past.</text><detail>The cut on your uterus from a past C-section should be what is called low-transverse. Your health care provider may ask for the report from your past C-section.</detail><detail>You should have no past history of ruptures of your uterus or scars from other surgeries.</detail><text>Your provider will want to make sure your pelvis is large enough for a vaginal birth and will monitor you to see if you have a big baby. It may not be safe for your baby to pass through your pelvis.</text><text>Because problems can occur quickly, where you plan to have your delivery is also a factor.</text><detail>You will need to be somewhere where you can be monitored through your entire labor.</detail><detail>The correct medical team must be nearby to do an emergency C-section if things do not go as planned.</detail><detail>Smaller hospitals may not have the right team. You may need to go to a bigger hospital to deliver.</detail></h2><h2 title="Who Decides if I Should Try for a VBAC?"><text>You and your provider will decide if a VBAC is right for you. Talk with your provider about the risks and benefits for you and your baby.</text><text>Every woman's risk is different, so ask what factors matter most for you. The more you know about VBAC, the easier it will be to decide if it is right for you.</text><text>If your provider says that you can have a VBAC, the chances are good that you can have one with success.

<item><title>Vacuum-assisted delivery</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000514.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>During vacuum assisted vaginal delivery, the doctor or midwife will use a vacuum (also called a vacuum extractor) to help move the baby through the birth canal.</text><text>The vacuum uses a soft plastic cup that attaches to the baby's head with suction. The doctor or midwife uses a handle on the cup to move the baby through the birth canal. </text></h2><h2 title="When is Vacuum-assisted Delivery Needed?"><text>Even after your cervix is fully dilated (open) and you have been pushing, you may need help getting the baby out. Reasons you may need help include:</text><detail>After pushing for several hours, the baby may no longer be moving down through the birth canal.</detail><detail>You may be too tired to push any longer.</detail><detail>The baby may be showing signs of distress and need to come out faster than you can push it out on your own.</detail><detail>A medical problem may make it risky for you to push. </detail><text>Before the vacuum can be used, your baby needs to be far enough down the birth canal. Your doctor will check you carefully to make sure it is safe to use the vacuum. This device is only safe to use when the baby is very close to being born. If the head is too high, a cesarean birth (C-section) will be recommended. </text><text>Most women will not need the vacuum to help them deliver. You may feel tired and tempted to ask for a little help. But if there is no true need for a vacuum-assisted delivery, it is safer for you and your baby to deliver on your own.</text></h2><h2 title="What Will Happen During a Vacuum-assisted Vaginal Delivery?"><text>You will be given medicine to block pain. This may be an epidural block or a numbing medicine placed in the vagina.</text><text>The plastic cup will be placed on the baby's head. Then, during a contraction, you will be asked to push again. At the same time, the doctor or midwife will gently pull to help deliver your baby.</text><text>After the doctor or midwife delivers the baby's head, you will push the baby the rest of the way out. After delivery, you can hold your baby on your tummy if they are doing well.</text><text>If the vacuum does not help move your baby, you may need to have a C-section. </text></h2><h2 title="What are the Risks?"><text>There are some risks with vacuum-assisted delivery, but it rarely causes lasting problems when properly used.</text><text>For the mother, tears in the vagina or on the perineum are more likely to occur with a vacuum-assisted birth compared to a vaginal birth that does not use the vacuum. </text><text>For the baby, the risks are mostly about bleeding: </text><detail>There may be bleeding under the baby's scalp. It will go away and does not cause serious problems. Your baby may be more likely to have jaundice (look a little yellow), which may be treated with light therapy.</detail><detail>Another type of bleeding occurs underneath the covering of the skull bone.

You also may have other types of treatment to help it heal.</text><h3 title="Debridement"><text>Debridement is the process of removing dead skin and tissue. This tissue must be removed to help your wound heal. There are many ways to do this. You may need to have general anesthesia (asleep and pain-free) for debridement of a large wound.</text><text>Surgical debridement uses a scalpel, scissors, or other sharp tools. During the procedure, your doctor will:</text><detail>Clean the skin around the wound</detail><detail>Probe the wound to see how deep it is</detail><detail>Cut away the dead tissue</detail><detail>Clean the wound </detail><text>Your wound may seem bigger and deeper after debridement. The area will be red or pink in color and look like fresh meat.</text><text>Other ways to remove dead or infected tissue are to:</text><detail>Sit or place your limb in a whirlpool bath.</detail><detail>Use a syringe to wash away dead tissue.</detail><detail>Apply wet-to-dry dressings to the area. A wet dressing is applied to the wound and allowed to dry. As it dries, it absorbs some of the dead tissue. The dressing is wet again and then gently pulled off along with dead tissue.</detail><detail>Put special chemicals, called enzymes, on your wound. These dissolve dead tissue from the wound. </detail><text>After the wound is clean, your doctor will apply a dressing to keep the wound moist and help prevent infection. There are many different types of dressings, including:</text><detail>Gels</detail><detail>Foams</detail><detail>Gauze</detail><detail>Films </detail><text>Your provider may use one or multiple types of dressings as your wound heals.</text></h3><h3 title="Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy"><text>Depending on the type of wound, your doctor may recommend hyperbaric oxygen therapy. Oxygen is important for healing.</text><text>During this treatment, you sit inside a special chamber. The air pressure inside the chamber is about two and a half times greater than the normal pressure in the atmosphere. This pressure helps your blood carry more oxygen to organs and tissues in your body.

<item><title>Working with a personal trainer</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000875.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>If you have had a hard time sticking with regular exercise, you may want to hire a personal trainer. Personal trainers are not only for athletes. They can help people of all ages and abilities reach their fitness goals. A personal trainer can help you create a fitness plan that is right for you and help you stick with it.</text></h2><h2 title="The Benefits of a Personal Trainer"><text>A personal trainer can:</text><detail>Assess your current level of fitness</detail><detail>Help you find an exercise program that is safe and works well for you</detail><detail>Help you set and achieve realistic fitness goals</detail><detail>Teach you the correct way to do exercises</detail><detail>Help you get the most out of your workout time</detail><detail>Offer support, guidance, and feedback</detail><detail>Provide motivation to continue exercising</detail><detail>Work with your health care provider or other health care professionals to create an exercise program if you are recovering from an illness or injury</detail><detail>Offer advice on lifestyle changes to improve fitness</detail></h2><h2 title="Affording a Personal Trainer"><text>Of course, hiring a personal trainer does cost money. The hourly rate for trainers can range from $20 to $100 an hour. These costs vary depending on the trainer's location, experience, and type of workout. </text><text>Hiring a trainer may be more affordable than you think. Some trainers will charge less if you commit to a long-term package or pay for all your sessions upfront. You can also save money if you do 30-minute sessions or do sessions with a friend or group. </text><text>Here are some questions to ask about the cost:</text><detail>How much do you charge for a session?</detail><detail>How long are your sessions?</detail><detail>What services do I get for that price?</detail><detail>Are there any other fees I need to pay (such as gym membership)?</detail><detail>Do you offer any discounts or package deals?</detail><detail>Do you offer any group sessions that are less expensive?</detail></h2><h2 title="Choosing a Personal Trainer"><text>You can find personal trainers in your area by asking friends, family members, or coworkers for referrals. You can also check with local fitness centers and health clubs. Before you hire a personal trainer, meet with that person and ask about their training and experience. Here are some things to look for:</text><detail>Training. Make sure your personal trainer has credentials. Look for National Commission for Certifying Agencies (NCCA) accredited certification. Another plus is a trainer who has a college degree in exercise science, physical education, or a related field. This shows that the trainer has a solid background in fitness.</detail><detail>Experience. Find out how long they have been a personal trainer. Ask about what types of clients the trainer typically works with. If you have a health condition, ask about the trainer's experience working with others who have had this condition. You can also ask for references from other clients.</detail><detail>Personality. It is important to find a personal trainer you like and think you can work with. Ask yourself if the trainer explains things in a way you can understand and seems open to your questions and concerns.</detail><detail>Schedule. Make sure the trainer can work within your schedule. Ask about cancellation policies and if you have to pay for sessions you need to cancel. </detail></h2><h2 title="Know the Limits of Your Personal Trainer"><text>Personal trainers can offer you professional advice on exercise. They can also provide general tips on living a healthy lifestyle. But be wary of a trainer who wants to offer more than that. Personal trainers are guided by a code of ethics and scope of practice for their field. Some red flags to watch for include:</text><detail>Offering medical advice. Your trainer can give you tips for a healthy lifestyle, but they should not tell you how to treat a medical condition.</detail><detail>Going against your provider's orders. If your provider has set limits on the type or amount of exercise you can do, your trainer should stay within these limits.</detail><detail>Touching you inappropriately. Your trainer may need to touch you as part of the instruction. If this makes you uncomfortable, let your trainer know. They should be able to instruct you without touching you at all. Your trainer should never touch you in any way that is sexual.</detail><detail>Selling nutritional supplements. Your trainer should not prescribe or sell you nutritional supplements. Providers and dietitians are the only health professionals qualified to give specific nutritional advice. </detail></h2><h2 title="When to Call Your Doctor"><text>If you have been inactive for a while, or have a medical condition, you should talk with your provider to make sure you are healthy enough for exercise.</text></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>Exercise - personal trainer</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 8/3/2018"><text>Updated by: Linda J.

Then you can plan ahead so that you can keep working with as little interruption as possible.</text></h2><h2 title="How Cancer May Affect You at Work"><text>If you feel well enough, you may find that the daily routine of a job helps you maintain a sense of balance. But having unrealistic goals could cause extra stress. If possible, prepare yourself for the ways cancer could affect you at work.</text><detail>You may need to take time off for treatments.</detail><detail>You may get tired more easily.</detail><detail>At times, you could be distracted by pain or stress.</detail><detail>You could have trouble remembering some things. </detail></h2><h2 title="Tips to Help You Work During Treatment"><text>There are ways you can plan ahead to make working through cancer easier on you and your co-workers.</text><detail>Schedule treatments late in the day so you can go home afterwards.</detail><detail>Try to schedule chemotherapy at the end of the week so you have the weekend to recover.</detail><detail>Talk to your manager about working at home some days, if possible. You can spend less time commuting and rest when you need to.</detail><detail>Let your boss know your treatment schedule and when you will be out of work.</detail><detail>Ask your family and friends to help around the house. This will leave you with more energy for work.</detail></h2><h2 title="How to Talk to Coworkers About Cancer"><text>Consider letting your co-workers know you have cancer. It might be easier to work if you do not have to make excuses for taking time off. Some co-workers may offer to help out if you have to be out of the office.</text><detail>Consider talking first to one or two people you trust. They might have ideas of how to share the news with your other coworkers.</detail><detail>Decide in advance how much information you want to share. The right amount will depend on you and your work culture.</detail><detail>Be matter of fact when you share the news. Share the basic facts: that you have cancer, are getting treatment, and plan to keep working. </detail><text>Some people may have an emotional reaction to the news. Your job is to take care of yourself. You do not have to help every person you know deal with their feelings about cancer. </text><text>Some co-workers may say things that are not helpful. They may want to talk about cancer when you want to work. They may ask for details that you do not want to share. Some people might try to give you advice about your treatment. Be ready with responses like:</text><detail>"I would rather not discuss that at work."</detail><detail>"I need to focus on this project right now."</detail><detail>"That is a private decision I will make with my doctor." </detail></h2><h2 title="If You Can Not Work"><text>Some people find that working through treatment is too difficult. Taking time off from work might be the best thing you can do for your health and your job. If your work performance is suffering, taking time off will allow your employer to bring in temporary help. </text><text>Your right to return to work after treatment is protected under federal law. You cannot be fired for being sick.</text><text>Depending on how long you need to be out of work, short-term or long-term disability may cover some of your salary while you are not working. Even if you plan to work through treatment, it is a good idea to find out if your employer has disability insurance. You can get an application for both short and long-term disability in case you need to apply later.</text></h2><h2 title="When to Call the Doctor"><text>Talk to your health care provider about how you feel at work, and if you should consider taking time off.

<item><title>When your child's cancer treatment stops working</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000852.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>Sometimes even the best treatments are not enough to stop cancer. Your child's cancer may have become resistant to anti-cancer drugs. It may have come back or kept growing despite treatment. This can be a difficult time for you and your family as you make decisions about ongoing treatment and what comes next.</text></h2><h2 title="What it Means When Treatment Stops Working"><text>It is not always clear when to stop treatment. If the first treatment did not work, doctors often try several different approaches. Usually the chance of success goes down with each new line of treatment. Your family and child's health care providers may need to decide whether further treatment is worth the side effects it causes your child, including pain and discomfort.</text></h2><h2 title="What Happens Next"><text>If treatment is no longer working or you have decided to stop treatment, the focus of care will change from treating cancer to making sure your child is comfortable.</text><text>Even if there is no hope that the cancer will go away, some treatments can keep tumors from growing and reduce pain. Your child's health care team may talk to you about treatments to prevent unnecessary pain. </text><text>If you have not done so already, you will need to make some decisions about the end of your child's life. It is incredibly hard to even think about, but taking care of these issues can help you focus on making the best of the rest of your child's life. Things to consider include:</text><detail>What kinds of treatment to use to help your child stay comfortable.</detail><detail>Whether or not to have a do not resuscitate order.</detail><detail>Where you want your child to spend his final days. Some families are more comfortable in a hospital where a doctor is right around the corner. Other families feel better in the comfort of home. Each family has to make the decision that is right for them.</detail><detail>How much to involve your child in decisions. </detail></h2><h2 title="Support for you and Your Family"><text>It may be the hardest thing you have to do but changing your focus from treating cancer to letting go can be the best thing for your child. You may be better able to understand what your child is going through, and what your child needs from you, if you are realistic about what is happening. </text><text>You do not have to figure this out on your own. Many hospitals and organizations have services to help children and parents cope with end-of-life issues. </text></h2><h2 title="How and When to Talk to Your Child"><text>Children often know more than their parents think. They watch adults' behavior and listen to what they say. If you avoid difficult subjects, you could give your child the message that the topics are off limits. Your child may want to talk, but not want to upset you.</text><text>On the other hand, it is important not to push your child to talk if she is not ready.</text><text>Your child's behavior can give you some clues. If your child asks questions about death, it could be a sign that she wants to talk. If your child changes the subject or wants to play, your child may have had enough for now.</text><detail>If your child is young, consider using toys or art to talk about death. You may talk about what happens if a doll gets sick, or talk about a book about an animal that dies.</detail><detail>Ask open-ended questions that give your child a chance to talk. "What do you think happened to Grandma when she died?"</detail><detail>Use direct language that your child will understand. Phrases like "pass away" or "go to sleep" may simply confuse your child.</detail><detail>Let your child know that she will not be alone when she dies.</detail><detail>Tell your child that the pain will go away when she dies. </detail></h2><h2 title="How to Help Your Child"><text>Your child's energy level will play a key role in how to spend the next weeks or months. If possible, keep your child involved in normal activities.</text><detail>Stick to routines like family meals, chores, and bedtime stories.</detail><detail>Let your child be a child. This may mean watching TV, playing games, or sending texts.</detail><detail>Encourage your child to stay in school if possible.</detail><detail>Support your child's time with friends. Whether in person, on the phone, or online, your child might want to stay connected to others.</detail><detail>Help your child set goals. Your child might want to take a trip or learn something new. Your child's goals will depend on his interests. </detail></h2><h2 title="Help Your Child Prepare"><text>As sad as it is, there are ways you can help your child prepare to die. Let your child know what physical changes may happen. Your child's doctor may help you with this. While it is best not to include scary details, knowing what to expect can help your child feel less anxious.</text><detail>Create family memories. You might go through photos and create a web site or photo book together.</detail><detail>Help your child say goodbye to special people in person or through letters.</detail><detail>Let your child know what lasting impact he will leave behind. Whether it was being a good son and brother, or helping other people, tell your child how he has made the world a better place.</detail><detail>Promise you will be OK when your child dies and will take care of the people and animals your child loves. </detail></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>End of life care - children; Palliative care - children; Advance care planning - children</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 7/26/2018"><text>Updated by: Todd Gersten, MD, Hematology/Oncology, Florida Cancer Specialists &amp;amp; Research Institute, Wellington, FL.

<item><title>When your child has diarrhea</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000693.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>Diarrhea is the passage of loose or watery stools. For some children, diarrhea is mild and will go away within a few days. For others, it may last longer. It can make your child lose too much fluid (dehydrated) and feel weak.</text><text>The stomach flu is a common cause of diarrhea. Medical treatments, such as antibiotics and some cancer treatments can also cause diarrhea.</text><text>This article speaks of diarrhea in children over 1 year of age.</text></h2><h2 title="Drinking Fluids"><text>It is easy for a child with diarrhea to lose too much fluid and become dehydrated. Lost fluids need to be replaced. For most children, drinking the kinds of fluids they normally have should be enough.</text><text>Some water is OK. But too much water alone, at any age, can be harmful.</text><text>Other products, such as Pedialyte and Infalyte, may help keep a child well-hydrated. These products can be bought at the supermarket or pharmacy.</text><text>Popsicles and Jell-O can be good sources of fluids, especially if your child is vomiting. You can slowly get large amounts of fluids into children with these products.</text><text>You may also give your child watered-down fruit juice or broth.</text><text>DO NOT use medicines to slow down your child's diarrhea without talking to a doctor first. Ask your child's health care provider if using sports drinks is OK.</text></h2><h2 title="Diet for Children With Diarrhea"><text>In many cases, you can continue feeding your child as usual. The diarrhea will normally go away in time, without any changes or treatment. But while children have diarrhea, they should:</text><detail>Eat small meals throughout the day instead of 3 big meals.</detail><detail>Eat some salty foods, such as pretzels and soup. </detail><text>When necessary, changes in the diet may help. No specific diet is recommended. But children often do better with bland foods. Give your child foods such as:</text><detail>Baked or broiled beef, pork, chicken, fish, or turkey</detail><detail>Cooked eggs</detail><detail>Bananas and other fresh fruits</detail><detail>Applesauce</detail><detail>Bread products made from refined, white flour</detail><detail>Pasta or white rice</detail><detail>Cereals such as cream of wheat, farina, oatmeal, and cornflakes</detail><detail>Pancakes and waffles made with white flour</detail><detail>Cornbread, prepared or served with very little honey or syrup</detail><detail>Cooked vegetables, such as carrots, green beans, mushrooms, beets, asparagus tips, acorn squash, and peeled zucchini</detail><detail>Some desserts and snacks, such as Jell-O, popsicles, cakes, cookies, or sherbet</detail><detail>Baked potatoes </detail><text>In general, removing seeds and skins from these foods is best. </text><text>Use low-fat milk, cheese, or yogurt. If dairy products are making the diarrhea worse or causing gas and bloating, your child may need to stop eating or drinking dairy products for a few days.</text><text>Children should be allowed to take their time returning to their normal eating habits. For some children, a return to their regular diet can also bring a return of diarrhea. This is often due to mild problems the gut has while absorbing regular foods.</text></h2><h2 title="Things Your Child Should Avoid Eating or Drinking"><text>Children should avoid certain kinds of foods when they have diarrhea, including fried foods, greasy foods, processed or fast foods, pastries, donuts, and sausage.</text><text>Avoid giving children apple juice and full-strength fruit juices, as they can loosen stool.</text><text>Have your child limit or cut out milk and other dairy products if they are making diarrhea worse or causing gas and bloating.</text><text>Your child should avoid fruits and vegetables that can cause gas, such as broccoli, peppers, beans, peas, berries, prunes, chickpeas, green leafy vegetables, and corn.</text><text>Your child should also avoid caffeine and carbonated drinks at this time.</text><text>When children are ready for regular foods again, try giving them:</text><detail>Bananas</detail><detail>Crackers</detail><detail>Chicken</detail><detail>Pasta</detail><detail>Rice cereal </detail></h2><h2 title="When to Call the Doctor"><text>Call your child's health care provider if your child has any of these symptoms:</text><detail>Much less activity than normal (not sitting up at all or not looking around)</detail><detail>Sunken eyes</detail><detail>Dry and sticky mouth</detail><detail>No tears when crying</detail><detail>Not urinated for 6 hours</detail><detail>Blood or mucus in the stool</detail><detail>Fever that does not go away</detail><detail>Stomach pain </detail></h2><h2 title="Review Date 10/18/2017"><text>Updated by: Neil K.

<item><title>When your cancer treatment stops working</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000851.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>Cancer treatments can keep cancer from spreading and even cure early stage cancer for many people. But not all cancer can be cured. Sometimes, treatment stops working or the cancer reaches a stage where it cannot be treated. This is called advanced cancer. </text><text>When you have advanced cancer, you move into a different stage of life. It is a time when you start to think about the end of life. This is not easy, but it doesn't mean you don't have options. Some people live for years with advanced cancer. Learning about advanced cancer and knowing your options can help you make decisions that work best for you.</text></h2><h2 title="Taking Stock "><text>Talk with your health care provider about what advanced cancer means for you. No two people are alike. Find out what your treatment options are, what you can expect from treatment, and what the outcome may be. You may want to talk this over with your family, or have a family meeting with your provider, so you can plan ahead together.</text></h2><h2 title="Deciding About Treatment"><text>You can still receive treatment when you have advanced cancer. But the goals will be different. Instead of curing cancer, treatment may help relieve symptoms and control cancer. This can help you be as comfortable as possible for as long as possible. It may also help you live longer. </text><text>Your treatment choices may include:</text><detail>Chemotherapy (chemo)</detail><detail>Immunotherapy</detail><detail>Targeted therapy</detail><detail>Hormone therapy</detail><text>Talk with your provider about your options and weigh the risks and benefits. Most cancer treatments have side effects that can affect the quality of your life. Some people decide that the side effects are not worth the small benefit from treatment. Other people choose to continue treatment for as long as possible. This is a personal decision you'll need to make together with your provider.</text></h2><h2 title="Other Treatment Choices"><text>When standard treatments no longer work for your cancer, you still have some choices about what type of care you'd like to get. Some options include:</text><detail>Clinical trials. These are research studies that look for new ways to treat cancer. There are benefits and risks to being in a clinical trial, and each one has rules about who can participate. If you're interested, ask your provider about clinical trials for your type of cancer.</detail><detail>Palliative care. This is treatment that helps prevent and treat symptoms and side effects from cancer. It can also help you with emotional and spiritual struggles while facing cancer. Palliative care can help improve your quality of life. You may receive this type of care at every stage of cancer treatment.</detail><detail>Hospice care. You may decide to choose hospice care if you are no longer seeking active treatment for your cancer. Hospice care aims to improve your symptoms and help you feel comfortable in the last months of life.</detail><detail>Home care. This is treatment in your home instead of a hospital. You may be able to manage your care and get the medical equipment you need right at home. You may have to pay for some services yourself. Check with your health plan to see what they cover. </detail></h2><h2 title="Dealing with Symptoms of Advanced Cancer"><text>You may think that symptoms will get worse as cancer progresses. This isn't always the case. You may have a few symptoms or none at all. Common symptoms include:</text><detail>Pain</detail><detail>Nausea and vomiting</detail><detail>Fatigue</detail><detail>Anxiety</detail><detail>Loss of appetite</detail><detail>Sleeping problems</detail><detail>Constipation</detail><detail>Confusion </detail><text>If you have any of these symptoms, it's important to tell your provider. DO NOT downplay symptoms. There are many treatments that can help you feel better. You should not have to be uncomfortable. Relieving symptoms can help you enjoy your life more fully. </text></h2><h2 title="Coping With Your Feelings"><text>As a person with cancer, you may have felt anger, denial, sadness, anxiety, grief, fear, or regret. These feelings may be even more intense now. It's normal to feel a range of emotions. How you deal with your feelings is up to you. Here are things that may help.</text><detail>Get support. Sharing your feelings with others can help make your emotions feel less intense. You can join a support group for people with cancer or meet with a counselor or clergy member.</detail><detail>Keep doing things you enjoy. Plan your day as you normally would and try to do things you enjoy. You could even take a class in something new.</detail><detail>Let yourself feel hopeful. Think of things every day to look forward to. By feeling hopeful, you can find acceptance, a sense of peace, and comfort.</detail><detail>Remember to laugh. Laughter can ease stress, help you relax, and connect you with others. Look for ways to bring humor into your life. Watch funny movies, read comic strips or humorous books, and try to see humor in the things around you. </detail></h2><h2 title="Planning for the end of Life"><text>This is a hard topic for many people to think about. But you may feel better knowing you have taken steps to prepare for the end of life, whatever that means to you. Here are some ways you may want to plan ahead:</text><detail>Createadvance directives. These are legal papers that outline the type of care you want or do not want to have. You can also choose someone to make medical decisions for you if you can't make them yourself. This is called a health care proxy. Having your wishes known ahead of time can help you and your loved ones worry less about the future.</detail><detail>Get your affairs in order. It's a good idea to go through your papers and make sure important documents are all together. This includes your will, trusts, insurance records, and bank statements. Keep them in a safe deposit box or with your lawyer. Make sure the people who will manage your affairs know where these documents are.</detail><detail>Spend time with loved ones. Reach out to your spouse, siblings, children, or grandchildren and try to make lasting memories. You may want to give meaningful items to those you love.</detail><detail>Leave a legacy. Some people choose to create special ways to celebrate their lives.

<item><title>When your baby or infant has a fever</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000319.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>The first fever a baby or infant has is often scary for parents. Most fevers are harmless and are caused by mild infections. Overdressing a child may even cause a rise in temperature.</text><text>Regardless, you should report any fever in a newborn that is higher than 100.4°F (38°C) (taken rectally) to the child's health care provider.</text></h2><h2 title="What to Expect at Home"><text>Fever is an important part of the body's defense against infection. Many older infants develop high fevers with even minor illnesses.</text><text>Febrile seizures occur in some children and can be scary to parents. However, most febrile seizures are over quickly. These seizures do not mean your child has epilepsy, and do not cause any lasting harm.</text></h2><h2 title="Eating and Drinking"><text>Your child should drink plenty of fluids.</text><detail>DO NOT give your child too much fruit or apple juice. Dilute these drinks by making them half water and half juice.</detail><detail>Popsicles or gelatin (Jell-O) are good choices, especially if the child is vomiting. </detail><text>Children can eat foods when they have a fever. But DO NOT force them to eat.</text><text>Children who are ill often tolerate bland foods better. A bland diet includes foods that are soft, not very spicy, and low in fiber. You may try:</text><detail>Breads, crackers, and pastas made with refined white flour</detail><detail>Refined hot cereals, such as oatmeal or cream of wheat </detail></h2><h2 title="Treating Your Child's Fever"><text>DO NOT bundle up a child with blankets or extra clothes, even if the child has the chills. This may keep the fever from coming down, or make it go higher.</text><detail>Try one layer of lightweight clothing, and one lightweight blanket for sleep.</detail><detail>The room should be comfortable, not too hot or too cool. If the room is hot or stuffy, a fan may help. </detail><text>Acetaminophen (Tylenol) and ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) help lower fever in children. Your child's doctor may tell you to use both types of medicine.</text><detail>In children under 3 months of age, call your child's provider first before giving them medicines.</detail><detail>Know how much your child weighs.

<item><title>When your baby is stillborn</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000626.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>

 
A stillbirth is when a baby dies in the womb during the last 20 weeks of pregnancy. A miscarriage is a fetal loss in the first half of pregnancy.
</text></h2><h2 title="More About Stillbirth"><text>About 1 in 160 pregnancies end in stillbirth. Stillbirth is less common than in the past because of better pregnancy care. Up to one half of the time, the reason for the stillbirth is never known.</text><text>Some factors that can cause stillbirth are:</text><detail>Birth defects</detail><detail>Abnormal chromosomes</detail><detail>Infection in the mother or fetus</detail><detail>Injuries</detail><detail>Chronic health conditions in the mother (diabetes, epilepsy, or high blood pressure)</detail><detail>Problems with the placenta that prevent the fetus from getting nourishment (such as placental detachment)</detail><detail>Sudden severe blood loss (hemorrhage) in the mother or fetus</detail><detail>Heart stoppage (cardiac arrest) in the mother or fetus</detail><detail>Umbilical cord problems </detail><text>Women at higher risk for stillbirth:</text><detail>Are older than age 35</detail><detail>Are obese</detail><detail>Are carrying multiple babies (twins or more)</detail><detail>Are African American</detail><detail>Have had a past stillbirth</detail><detail>Have high blood pressure or diabetes</detail><detail>Have other medical conditions (like lupus)</detail><detail>Take drugs </detail></h2><h2 title="What Will Happen?"><text>The health care provider will use an ultrasound to confirm that the baby's heart has stopped beating. If the woman's health is at risk, she will need to deliver the baby right away. Otherwise, she can choose to have medicine to start labor or wait for labor to begin on its own. </text><text>After the delivery, provider will look at the placenta, fetus, and umbilical cord for signs of problems. The parents will be asked for permission to do more detailed tests. These may include internal exams (autopsy), x-rays, and genetic tests. </text><text>It is natural for parents to feel uneasy about these tests when they are dealing with the loss of a baby. But learning the cause of the stillbirth can help a woman have a healthy baby in the future. It may also help some parents cope with their loss to know as much as they can. </text></h2><h2 title="Coping with the Grief"><text>Stillbirth is a tragic event for a family. The grief of a pregnancy loss can raise the risk of postpartum depression. People cope with grief in different ways. It may be helpful to talk to your provider or a counselor about your feelings. Other things that can help you through the mourning are to:</text><detail>Pay attention to your health. Eat and sleep well so your body stays strong.</detail><detail>Find ways to express your feelings. Joining a support group, talking to family and friends, and keeping a journal are some ways to express grief.</detail><detail>Educate yourself. Learning about the problem, what you might be able to do, and how other people have coped can help you.</detail><detail>Give yourself time to heal. Grieving is a process. Accept that it will take time to feel better. </detail></h2><h2 title="The Risk for Stillbirth"><text>Most women who have had a stillbirth are very likely to have a healthy pregnancy in the future. Placenta and cord problems or chromosome defects are unlikely to occur again. Some things you can do to help prevent another stillbirth are:</text><detail>Meet with a genetic counselor. If the baby died because of an inherited problem, you can learn your risks for the future.</detail><detail>Talk to your provider before you get pregnant. Make sure chronic health problems like diabetes are in good control. Tell your provider about all your medicines, even the ones you buy without a prescription.</detail><detail>Lose weight if you're overweight. Obesity raises the risk of stillbirth. Ask your provider how to safely lose weight before you get pregnant.</detail><detail>Adopt good health habits. Smoking, drinking, and using street drugs are dangerous during pregnancy. Get help quitting before you get pregnant.</detail><detail>Get special prenatal care. Women who have had a stillbirth will be watched carefully during pregnancy. They may need special tests to monitor their baby's growth and well-being. </detail></h2><h2 title="When to Call the Doctor"><text>Call the provider if you have any of the following problems:</text><detail>Fever.</detail><detail>Heavy vaginal bleeding.</detail><detail>Sick feeling, throwing up, diarrhea, or abdominal pain.</detail><detail>Depression and a feeling like you cannot cope with what has happened.</detail><detail>Your baby has not moved as much as usual. After you eat and while you are sitting still, count the movements. Normally you should expect your baby to move 10 times in an hour.</detail></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>Stillbirth; Fetal demise; Pregnancy - stillborn</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 11/11/2016"><text>Updated by: Irina Burd, MD, PhD, Associate Professor of Gynecology and Obstetrics at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD.

<item><title>When you pass your due date</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000515.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>Most pregnancies last 37 to 42 weeks, but some take longer. If your pregnancy lasts more than 42 weeks, it is called post-term (past due). This happens in a small number of pregnancies.</text><text>While there are some risks in a post-term pregnancy, most post-term babies are born healthy. Your health care provider can do special tests to check on the health of your baby. Keeping a close eye on the baby's health will help increase the chance of good outcomes.</text></h2><h2 title="Why Does it Happen?"><text>Many women who go past 40 weeks are not really post-term. Their due date was just not calculated correctly. After all, a due date is not exact, but an estimate.</text><text>Your due date is estimated based on the first day of your last period, the size of your uterus (womb) early in your pregnancy, and with an ultrasound early in pregnancy. However:</text><detail>Many women cannot remember the exact day of their last period, which makes it hard to predict a due date.</detail><detail>Not all menstrual cycles are the same length.</detail><detail>Some women DO NOT get an ultrasound early in pregnancy to establish their most accurate due date.</detail><text>When a pregnancy truly is post-term and goes past 42 weeks, no one knows for sure what causes it to happen.</text></h2><h2 title="What are the Risks?"><text>If you have not given birth by 42 weeks, there are greater health risks for you and your baby.</text><text>The placenta is the link between you and your baby. As you pass your due date, the placenta may not work as well as before. This could lessen the amount of oxygen and nutrients that the baby gets from you. As a result, the baby:</text><detail>May not grow as well as before.</detail><detail>May show signs of fetal stress. This means the baby's heart rate does not react normally.</detail><detail>May have a harder time during labor.</detail><detail>Has a higher chance of stillbirth (being born dead). Stillbirth is not common but begins to increase the most after 42 weeks gestation.</detail><text>Other problems that may occur:</text><detail>If the baby grows too big, it can make it harder for you to deliver vaginally. You may need to give birth by cesarean birth (C-section).</detail><detail>The amount of amniotic fluid (water surrounding the baby) may decrease. When this happens, the umbilical cord may get pinched or pressed. This can also limit the oxygen and nutrients the baby gets from you.</detail><text>Any of these problems can increase the need for a C-section.</text></h2><h2 title="What if my Pregnancy Goes Past the due Date?"><text>Until you reach 41 weeks, your provider may not do anything unless there are problems.</text><text>If you reach 41 weeks (1 week overdue), your provider will do tests to check on the baby. These tests include a non-stress test and biophysical profile (ultrasound). </text><detail>The tests may show that the baby is active and healthy, and the amount of amniotic fluid is normal. If so, your doctor may decide to wait until you go into labor on your own.</detail><detail>These tests can also show that the baby is having problems. You and your provider must decide if labor needs to be induced. </detail><text>When you reach between 41 and 42 weeks, the health risks to you and your baby become even greater. Your provider will likely want to induce labor. In older women, especially older than 40, it may be recommended to induce labor as early as 39 weeks. </text></h2><h2 title="How Will the Doctor Induce Labor?"><text>When you have not gone into labor on your own, your provider will help you start. This may be done by:</text><detail>Using a medicine called oxytocin. This medicine can cause contractions to start and is given through an IV line.</detail><detail>Placing medicine suppositories inside the vagina. This will help ripen (soften) the cervix and may help labor to start.</detail><detail>Breaking your water (rupturing the membranes which hold amniotic fluid) can be done for some women to help labor start.</detail><detail>Putting a catheter or tube in the cervix to help it begin to dilate slowly. </detail></h2><h2 title="Will I Need a C-section?"><text>You will only need a C-section if:</text><detail>Your labor cannot be started by your provider with the techniques described above.</detail><detail>Your baby's heart rate tests show possible fetal distress.</detail><detail>Your labor stops progressing normally once it has started. </detail></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>Pregnancy complications - post-term; Pregnancy complications - overdue</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 4/19/2018"><text>Updated by: John D.

<item><title>When you need to gain more weight during pregnancy</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000617.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>Most women should gain somewhere between 25 and 35 pounds (11 and 16 kilograms) during pregnancy. If a woman does not gain enough weight, there may be health problems for the mother and baby.</text></h2><h2 title="What is the Right Amount of Weight to Gain?"><text>Most women will gain 2 to 4 pounds (1 to 2 kilograms) during the first trimester, and 1 pound (.5 kilogram) a week for the rest of the pregnancy. Through the entire pregnancy:</text><detail>Overweight women need to gain less (15 to 20 pounds or 7 to 9 kilograms or less, depending on their prepregnancy weight).</detail><detail>Underweight women will need to gain more (28 to 40 pounds or 13 to 18 kilograms).</detail><detail>You should gain more weight if you are having more than one baby. Women having twins will need to gain 37 to 54 pounds (17 to 24 kilograms).</detail><text>Some women have a hard time gaining weight during pregnancy. Sometimes, it is because they start a pregnancy underweight, or they have other health issues that keep them from gaining weight. Sometimes, they are not able to keep food down due to nausea and vomiting.</text><text>Either way, a balanced, nutrient-rich diet, along with moderate exercise, is the basis for a healthy pregnancy. Ask your health care provider how many calories you should eat each day, and how you can gain the right amount of weight.</text></h2><h2 title="If You Need to Gain Weight During Pregnancy"><text>If your provider says you should gain more weight, here are some tips to help:</text><detail>DO NOT skip meals. Instead of eating 3 big meals, eat 5 to 6 small meals every day.</detail><detail>Keep quick, easy snacks on hand. Nuts, raisins, cheese and crackers, dried fruit, and ice cream or yogurt are good choices.</detail><detail>Spread peanut butter on toast, crackers, apples, bananas, or celery. One tablespoon (16 grams) of creamy peanut butter will provide about 100 calories and 3.5 grams of protein.</detail><detail>Add nonfat powdered milk to foods such as mashed potatoes, scrambled eggs, and hot cereal.</detail><detail>Add butter or margarine, cream cheese, gravy, sour cream, and cheese to your meals.</detail><detail>Try to eat more foods that are high in good fats, such as nuts, fatty fish, avocados, and olive oil.</detail><detail>Drink juices made from real fruit that are high in vitamin C or beta carotene. Grapefruit juice, orange juice, papaya nectar, apricot nectar, and carrot juice are good choices.</detail><detail>Avoid junk food.</detail><detail>Ask your provider about taking prenatal vitamins and other supplements.</detail><detail>See a dietitian or nutritionist for help with your diet, if your provider recommends it. </detail></h2><h2 title="Body Image and Pregnancy"><text>If you have struggled with your weight in the past, it may be hard to accept that it is OK to gain weight now. It is normal to feel anxious as the numbers on the scale edge up.</text><text>Pregnancy is not a time to diet or worry about weight gain. Keep in mind that weight gain is needed for a healthy pregnancy. The extra weight will come off after you have had your baby. Remember not to gain too much, as this can cause your baby to be too big. A healthy diet and regular exercise will help you have a healthy pregnancy and baby.</text><text>If worries about your body image affect your pregnancy or daily life, talk to your provider.</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 11/11/2016"><text>Updated by: Irina Burd, MD, PhD, Associate Professor of Gynecology and Obstetrics at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD.

<item><title>When you have urinary incontinence</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000138.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>You have urinary incontinence. This means you are not able to keep urine from leaking from your urethra. This is the tube that carries urine out of your body from your bladder. Urinary incontinence may occur because of aging, surgery, weight gain, neurologic disorders, or childbirth. There are many things you can do to help keep urinary incontinence from affecting your daily life.</text></h2><h2 title="Skin Care "><text>You may need to take special care of the skin around your urethra. These steps may help.</text><text>Clean the area around your urethra right after urinating. This will help keep the skin from getting irritated. It will also prevent infection. Ask your health care provider about special skin cleaners for people who have urinary incontinence.</text><detail>Using these products will often not cause irritation or dryness.</detail><detail>Most of these do not need to be rinsed off. You can just wipe the area with a cloth. </detail><text>Use warm water and wash gently when bathing. Scrubbing too hard can hurt the skin. After bathing, use a moisturizer and a barrier cream.</text><detail>Barrier creams keep water and urine away from your skin.</detail><detail>Some barrier creams contain petroleum jelly, zinc oxide, cocoa butter, kaolin, lanolin, or paraffin. </detail><text>Ask your provider about deodorizing tablets to help with odor.</text><text>Clean your mattress if it becomes wet.</text><detail>Use a solution of equal parts white vinegar and water.</detail><detail>Once the mattress has dried, rub baking soda into the stain, and then vacuum off the baking powder. </detail><text>You can also use water-resistant sheets to keep urine from soaking into your mattress.</text></h2><h2 title="Diet"><text>Eat healthy foods and exercise regularly. Try to lose weight if you are overweight. Being too heavy will weaken the muscles that help you stop urinating.</text><text>Drink plenty of water:</text><detail>Drinking enough water will help keep odors away.</detail><detail>Drinking more water may even help reduce leakage. </detail><text>DO NOT drink anything 2 to 4 hours before going to bed. Empty your bladder before going to bed to help prevent urine leakage during the night.</text><text>Avoid foods and beverages that can make urine leakage worse. These include:</text><detail>Caffeine (coffee, tea, some sodas)</detail><detail>Carbonated drinks, such as soda and sparkling water</detail><detail>Alcoholic beverages</detail><detail>Citrus fruits and juices (lemon, lime, orange, and grapefruit)</detail><detail>Tomatoes and tomato-based foods and sauces</detail><detail>Spicy foods</detail><detail>Chocolate</detail><detail>Sugars and honey</detail><detail>Artificial sweeteners</detail><detail>Milk and milk products </detail><text>Get more fiber in your diet, or take fiber supplements to prevent constipation.</text><text>Follow these steps when you exercise:</text><detail>DO NOT drink too much before you exercise.</detail><detail>Urinate right before you exercise.</detail><detail>Try wearing pads to absorb leakage or urethral inserts to block the flow of urine. </detail></h2><h2 title="Controlling the Need to Urinate"><text>Some activities may increase leakage for some people. Things to avoid include:</text><detail>Coughing, sneezing, and straining, and other actions that put extra pressure on the pelvic muscles. Get treatment for a cold or lung problems that make you cough or sneeze.</detail><detail>Very heavy lifting. </detail><text>Ask your provider about things you can do to ignore urges to pass urine. After a few weeks, you should leak urine less often.</text><text>Train your bladder to wait a longer time between trips to the toilet.</text><detail>Start by trying to hold off for 10 minutes. Slowly increase this waiting time to 20 minutes.</detail><detail>Learn to relax and breathe slowly. You can also do something that takes your mind off your need to urinate.</detail><detail>The goal is to learn to hold the urine for up to 4 hours.</detail><text>Urinate at set times, even if you do not feel the urge. Schedule yourself to urinate every 2 to 4 hours.</text><text>Empty your bladder all the way. After you go once, go again a few minutes later.</text><text>Even though you are training your bladder to hold in urine for longer periods of time, you should still empty your bladder more often during times when you might leak. Set aside specific times to train your bladder. Urinate often enough at other times when you are not actively trying to train your bladder to help prevent incontinence.</text><text>Ask your provider about medicines that may help.</text><text>Surgery may be an option for you. Ask your provider if you would be a candidate.</text></h2><h2 title="Pelvic Floor Muscle Strengthening"><text>Your provider may recommend Kegel exercises. These are exercises in which you tighten the muscles that you use to stop urine flow.</text><text>You may learn how to do these exercises correctly using biofeedback. Your provider will help you learn how to tighten your muscles while you are being monitored with a computer.</text><text>It may help to have formal pelvic floor physical therapy.

<item><title>When you feel like changing your medicine</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000616.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>You may find a time when you want to stop or change your medicine. But changing or stopping your medicine on your own can be dangerous. It could make your condition worse.</text><text>Learn how to talk to your doctor and pharmacist about your medicine. You can make decisions together so you feel well with your medicines. </text></h2><h2 title="Common Reasons for Changing Medicine"><text>You may think about stopping or changing your medicine when you:</text><detail>Feel better</detail><detail>Think it is not working</detail><detail>Are having side effects and feel bad</detail><detail>Are worried about the costs </detail></h2><h2 title="Do Not Stop Taking Your Medicine When You Feel Better"><text>You often feel better quickly from taking some medicine. You may feel like you do not need to take it anymore.</text><text>If you stop taking your medicine before you are supposed to, you will not get its full effect, or your condition can get worse. Here are some examples:</text><detail>When you take antibiotics, you will feel better in 1 to 2 days. If you stop taking the medicine early, you may get sick again.</detail><detail>If you are taking a steroid pack for your asthma, you will feel better quickly. You may think you can stop taking it because you feel so good. Suddenly stopping a steroid pack can make you feel very sick. </detail></h2><h2 title="Do Not Stop Taking Your Medicine if You Think It Isn't Working"><text>If you do not feel better, you may think your medicine is not working. Talk to your health care provider before you make any changes. Find out:</text><detail>What to expect from the medicine. Some medicines may take more time to make a difference.</detail><detail>If you are taking the medicine correctly.</detail><detail>If there is another medicine that may work better.</detail></h2><h2 title="If Your Medicine Makes you Feel Sick, Talk to Your Doctor"><text>Some medicines may make you feel sick. You may have a sick stomach, itchy skin, dry throat, or something else that does not feel right.</text><text>When your medicine makes you feel sick, you may want to stop taking it. Talk to your doctor before stopping any medicine. The doctor may:</text><detail>Change your dose so you do not feel sick from it.</detail><detail>Change your medicine to a different kind.</detail><detail>Give you suggestions on how to feel better when taking the medicine. </detail></h2><h2 title="Talk to Your Doctor if You Can't Afford Your Medicine"><text>Medicines can cost a lot of money. If you are worried about money, you may want to cut costs.</text><text>DO NOT cut pills in half unless your doctor tells you to. DO NOT take fewer doses than prescribed or take your medicine only when you feel bad. Doing so can make your condition worse.</text><text>Talk to your doctor if you do not have enough money for your medicine. Your doctor may be able to change your medicine to a generic brand that costs less. Many pharmacies and drug companies have programs for reducing the cost for people.</text></h2><h2 title="When to Call the Doctor"><text>

 
Call the doctor when you feel like changing your medicine. Know all the medicines that you take. Tell your doctor about your prescription medicines, over-the-counter drugs, and any vitamins, supplements, or herbs. Together with your doctor, decide what medicines you will take.

After any weight-loss surgery, your child will:</text><detail>Have a smaller stomach</detail><detail>Feel full or satisfied with less food</detail><detail>Not be able to eat as much as before </detail><text>The most common operation now offered to teens is the vertical sleeve gastrectomy.</text><text>Adjustable gastric banding is another type of weight-loss surgery. However, this procedure has largely been replaced by sleeve gastrectomy.</text><text>All weight loss operations can be performed through 5 to 6 small cuts on the belly. This is known as laparoscopic surgery.</text></h2><h2 title="Is Weight-loss Surgery Right for Your Child?"><text>Most children who have weight-loss surgery also have health problems that are related to the extra body weight.</text><text>The body mass index (BMI) measures below are used by many doctors to decide who can be helped the most by weight-loss surgery. But not all doctors agree about this. The general guidelines are:</text><text>A BMI of 35 or higher and a serious health condition related to obesity, such as:</text><detail>Diabetes (high blood sugar)</detail><detail>Pseudotumor cerebri (increased pressure inside the skull)</detail><detail>Moderate or severe sleep apnea (symptoms include daytime sleepiness and loud snoring, gasping, and holding breath while asleep)</detail><detail>Severe inflammation of the liver that is caused by excess fat </detail><text>A BMI of 40 or higher.</text><text>Other factors should also be considered before a child or teenager has weight-loss surgery.</text><detail>The child has not been able to lose weight while on a diet and exercise program for at least 6 months, while under the care of a physician.</detail><detail>The teenager should be finished growing (most often 13-years-old or older for girls and 15-years-old or older for boys).</detail><detail>Parents and the teen must understand and be willing to follow the many lifestyle changes that are necessary after surgery.</detail><detail>The teen has not used any illegal substances (alcohol or drugs) during the 12 months before surgery. </detail><text>Children who have weight-loss surgery should receive care at an adolescent bariatric surgery center. There, a team of experts will give them the special care they need.</text></h2><h2 title="Is Weight-loss Surgery Safe for Teens?"><text>The studies that have been done on bariatric surgery in teens show these operations are as safe for this age group as for adults. However, not as much research has been done to show if there are any long-term effects on growth for teens that undergo weight loss surgery.</text><text>Teenagers' bodies are still changing and developing. They will need to be careful to get enough nutrients during the period of weight loss following surgery.</text><text>Gastric bypass surgery changes the way some nutrients are absorbed. Teens that have this kind of weight-loss surgery will need to take certain vitamins and minerals for the rest of their life. In most cases, a sleeve gastrectomy does not cause changes in how nutrients are absorbed. However, teens may still need to take vitamins and minerals.</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 6/1/2017"><text>Updated by: John E.

<item><title>Weight-loss medicines</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000346.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>There are several different medicines used for weight loss. Before trying weight-loss medicines, your health care provider will have you try non-drug ways for losing weight. While weight-loss drugs can be helpful, the overall weight loss achieved is limited. In addition, it's likely the weight will be regained when the medicines are stopped.</text></h2><h2 title="Medicine Options"><text>Several weight-loss medicines are available. About 5 to 10 pounds (2 to 4.5 kilograms) can be lost by taking these medicines. But not everyone loses weight while taking them. Most people also regain the weight after they stop taking the medicines, unless they have made lasting lifestyle changes, such as exercising and cutting unhealthy foods from their diets.</text><text>You may also see ads for herbal remedies and supplements that claim to help you lose weight. Many of these claims are not true. Some of these supplements can have serious side effects.</text><text>Note for women: Pregnant or nursing women should never take diet medicines. This includes prescription, herbal, and over-the-counter remedies. Over-the-counter refers to medicines, herbs, or supplements you can buy without a prescription.</text><text>The different weight-loss medicines are described below. Be sure to talk with your provider about which medicine is right for you.</text><text>ORLISTAT (XENICAL AND ALLI)</text><text>Orlistat works by slowing the absorption of fat in the intestine by about 30%. It is approved for long-term use.</text><text>About 6 pounds (3 kilograms) can be lost when using this medicine. But not everyone loses weight while taking it. Many people regain most of the weight within 2 years after they stop using it.</text><text>The most unpleasant side effect of orlistat is oily diarrhea that may leak from the anus. Eating less fatty foods can reduce this effect. Despite this side effect, most people tolerate this medicine.</text><text>Xenical is the brand of orlistat your provider can prescribe for you. You can also buy orlistat without a prescription under the name Alli. These pills are half the strength of Xenical. Orlistat costs about $100 or more a month. Consider whether the cost, side effects, and the small weight loss you can expect are worth it to you.</text><text>Your body may not absorb important vitamins, minerals, and other nutrients from food while you are using orlistat. You should take a daily multivitamin if you use orlistat.</text><text>MEDICINES THAT SUPPRESS THE APPETITE</text><text>These medicines work in your brain by making you less interested in food.</text><text>Not everyone loses weight while taking the medicines. Most people regain the weight after they stop taking the medicine, unless they have made lasting lifestyle changes. Talk with your provider about how much weight you can expect to lose by taking any of these medicines.</text><text>These medicines are available only by prescription. They include:</text><detail>Phentermine (Adipex-P, Lomaira, Phentercot, Phentride, Pro-Fast)</detail><detail>Phentermine combined with topiramate (Qsymia)</detail><detail>Benzphetamine, Phendimetrazine (Bontril, Obezine, Phendiet, Prelu-2)</detail><detail>Diethylpropion (Tenuate)</detail><detail>Naltrexone combined with bupropion (Contrave)</detail><detail>Lorcaserin (Belviq) </detail><text>Only lorcaserin and phentermine/topiramate are approved for long-term use. All other drugs are approved for short-term use of no more than a few weeks.</text></h2><h2 title="Side Effects"><text>Be sure you understand the side effects of weight-loss medicines. Side effects can include:</text><detail>Increase in blood pressure</detail><detail>Problems sleeping, headache, nervousness, and palpitations</detail><detail>Nausea, constipation, and dry mouth</detail><detail>Depression, which some people who are obese struggle with already</detail></h2><h2 title="If You Have Diabetes"><text>If you have diabetes that needs treatment with medicines, you may want to ask your provider about diabetes medicines that cause weight-loss. These include:</text><detail>Canagliflozin (Invokana)</detail><detail>Dapagliflozin (Farxiga)</detail><detail>Dapagliflozin combined with saxagliptin (Qtern)</detail><detail>Empagliflozin (Jardiance)</detail><detail>Exenatide (Byetta, Bydureon)</detail><detail>Liraglutide (Victoza)</detail><detail>Metformin (Glucophage, Glumetza, and Fortamet) </detail><text>These medicines are not approved by the FDA to treat weight-loss. So you should not take them if you do not have diabetes.</text></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>Prescription weight loss drugs; Diabetes - weight loss drugs; Obesity - weight loss drugs; Overweight - weight loss drugs</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 5/21/2017"><text>Updated by: Laura J.

<item><title>Weight loss and alcohol</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000889.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>If you are trying to lose weight, you can boost your efforts by cutting back on alcoholic drinks. Alcohol can cause weight gain in a couple of ways. First, alcohol is high in calories. Some mixed drinks can contain as many calories as a meal, but without the nutrients. Second, you also may make poor food choices when you drink.</text><text>While you do not have to cut out all alcohol if you are trying to lose weight, you may need to make some changes. You should watch the number, and type, of drinks you choose. You will also want to keep an eye on how drinking affects your eating habits. </text></h2><h2 title="Calories and Portions Count"><text>So, how much can you drink if you are trying to lose weight? Health experts recommend that anyone who drinks does so in moderation. This means no more than 1 drink per day for women and no more than 2 drinks per day for men. You may want to drink even less than that while dieting. Keep in mind that alcohol has empty calories. This means it has a lot of calories (7 per gram versus 4 per gram for carbohydrate and protein) but few nutrients. So in order to drink alcohol while cutting back on calories, you need to plan it into your daily calorie count so you do not go over. Also remember that when you drink alcohol, you are replacing potentially healthy, and filling, food with calories that do not fill you up.</text><text>When choosing what to drink, you will want to choose your calories wisely. Here is a quick comparison of some common alcoholic drinks:</text><detail>Regular beer, about 150 calories for a 12-ounce (355 mL) glass</detail><detail>Light beer, about 100 calories for a 12-ounce (355 mL) glass</detail><detail>Wine, about 100 calories for a 5-ounce (145 mL) glass</detail><detail>Distilled alcohol (gin, rum, vodka, whiskey), about 100 calories for a 1.5-ounce (45 mL) serving</detail><detail>Martini (extra dry), about 140 calories for a 2.25-ounce (65 mL) glass</detail><detail>Pina colada, about 500 calories in a 7-ounce (205 mL) glass </detail><text>Pay attention to what else goes in your drink. Many mixed drinks include juices, simple syrup, or liqueur, which all add extra calories. These calories can add up quickly. Look for lower calorie options, such as a splash of juice and soda water. You may want to skip mixed drinks completely and stick with beer or wine. </text><text>Portion size is something else you should keep an eye on. Know what a standard drink looks like:</text><detail>12 ounces (355 mL) of beer</detail><detail>5 ounces (145 mL) of wine</detail><detail>1.5 ounces (45 mL, or one shot) of hard liquor </detail><text>The sizes of alcoholic drinks at a restaurant or bar are often larger than the standard amounts listed above. In some cases, 1 drink may actually have 2 or more servings of alcohol and calories. If you are served a drink that is larger than the standard size, skip a second drink. At home, use a jigger when mixing drinks, and serve them in smaller glasses. It will feel like you are having more. </text></h2><h2 title="Eat Before you Drink"><text>Drinking on an empty stomach will make you feel tipsy quicker. This can lead to eating or drinking more than you want to. Having some food before you drink will help your stomach absorb the alcohol more slowly and help you make better choices.</text><text>Studies show that people tend to make poor food choices when drinking alcohol. To avoid piling on the calories after a drink or two, have some healthy snacks ready to eat when you get home or make plans to have a healthy meal after your drink. Good snack choices include fruit, air-popped popcorn, or hummus and veggies.</text></h2><h2 title="Take it Slow"><text>Just like eating too fast can lead to overeating, gulping down drinks may cause you to drink more than you would like. Sip your drink slowly, putting it down in between sips. When you are done, have a non-alcoholic drink, such as water or low-calorie soda, before having more alcohol.</text></h2><h2 title="Make a Plan for Drinking"><text>The best way to control calories from drinking is to limit how much you drink. Before you go out, set a limit for yourself and stick with it. It is OK to turn down a drink you do not want or refuse a top-off on your wine glass. You can skip drinking altogether and volunteer to be the designated driver.</text></h2><h2 title="When to Call the Doctor"><text>Call your health care provider if:</text><detail>You or someone you love is concerned about how much you drink.</detail><detail>You cannot control your drinking.</detail><detail>Your drinking is causing problems at home, work, or school. </detail></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>Weight loss - alcohol; Overweight - alcohol; Obesity - alcohol; Diet - alcohol</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 4/23/2018"><text>Updated by: Emily Wax, RD, The Brooklyn Hospital Center, Brooklyn, NY.

<item><title>Weight gain after quitting smoking: What to do</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000811.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>Many people gain weight when they quit smoking cigarettes. On average, people gain 5 to 10 pounds (2.25 to 4.5 kilograms) in the months after they give up smoking.</text><text>You may put off quitting if you are worried about adding extra weight. But NOT smoking is one of the best things you can do for your health. Fortunately, there are things you can do to keep your weight under control when you quit.</text></h2><h2 title="Why People who Quit Smoking Gain Weight "><text>There are a couple of reasons why people gain weight when they give up cigarettes. Some have to do with the way nicotine affects your body.</text><detail>The nicotine in cigarettes speeds up your metabolism. Nicotine increases the amount of calories your body uses at rest by about 7% to 15%. Without cigarettes, your body may burn food more slowly.</detail><detail>Cigarettes reduce appetite. When you quit smoking, you may feel hungrier.</detail><detail>Smoking is a habit. After you quit, you may crave high-calorie foods to replace cigarettes.</detail></h2><h2 title="What you can do"><text>As you get ready to quit smoking, here are some things you can do to keep your weight in check.</text><detail>Get active.Physical activity helps you burn calories. It can also help you ward off cravings for unhealthy foods or cigarettes. If you already exercise, you may need to exercise for longer or more often to burn the calories nicotine used to help remove.</detail><detail>Shop for healthy groceries. Decide what you will buy before you get to the store. Make a list of healthy foods like fruit, vegetables, and low-fat yogurt that you can indulge in without eating too many calories. Stock up on low-calorie "finger foods" that can keep your hands busy, such as sliced apples, baby carrots, or pre-portioned unsalted nuts.</detail><detail>Stock up on sugar-free gum. It can keep your mouth busy without adding calories or exposing your teeth to sugar.</detail><detail>Create healthy eating habits. Make a healthy meal plan ahead of time so you can combat cravings when they hit. It is easier to say "no" to fried chicken nuggets if you are looking ahead to a roast chicken with vegetables for dinner.</detail><detail>Never let yourself get too hungry. A little hunger is a good thing, but if you are so hungry that you have to eat right away, you are more likely to reach for a diet-busting option. Learning to eat foods that fill you up can also help ward off hunger.</detail><detail>Sleep well. If you often do not get enough sleep, you are at greater risk of putting on extra weight.</detail><detail>Control your drinking. Alcohol, sugary sodas, and sweetened juices may go down easy, but they add up, and can lead to weight gain. Try sparkling water with 100% fruit juice or herbal tea instead.</detail></h2><h2 title="Why Quitting is Worth it"><text>Giving up a habit takes time to get used to, both physically and emotionally. Take one step at a time. If you do put on some weight but manage to stay off cigarettes, congratulate yourself. There are many benefits of quitting.</text><detail>Your lungs and heart will be stronger</detail><detail>Your skin will look younger</detail><detail>Your teeth will be whiter</detail><detail>You will have better breath</detail><detail>Your hair and clothes will smell better</detail><detail>You will have more money when you are not buying cigarettes</detail><detail>You will perform better in sports or other physical activities</detail></h2><h2 title="When to Call the Doctor"><text>If you have tried to quit smoking and relapsed your health care provider may suggest nicotine replacement therapy. Treatments that come in the form of a patch, gum, nasal spray, or inhaler give you small doses of nicotine throughout the day. They can help ease the transition from smoking to going totally smoke free.</text><text>If you gain weight after quitting and cannot lose it, you might have better results in an organized program. Ask your provider to recommend a program with a good record that can help you lose weight in a healthy, lasting way.</text></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>Cigarettes - weight gain; Smoking cessation - weight gain; Smokeless tobacco - weight gain; Tobacco cessation - weight gain; Nicotine cessation - weight gain; Weight loss - quitting smoking</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 8/3/2018"><text>Updated by: Linda J.

<item><title>Wearing gloves in the hospital</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000452.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>Gloves are called personal protective equipment (PPE). Other types of PPE are gowns, masks, and shoe and head covers.</text><text>Gloves create a barrier between germs and your hands. Wearing gloves in the hospital helps prevent the spread of germs.</text></h2><h2 title="Why Wear Gloves"><text>Wearing gloves helps protect both patients and health care workers from infection.</text></h2><h2 title="When to Wear Gloves"><text>Gloves help keep your hands clean and lessen your chance of getting germs that can make you sick.</text><text>Wear gloves every time you touch blood, bodily fluids, bodily tissues, mucous membranes, or broken skin. You should wear gloves for this sort of contact, even if a patient seems healthy and has no signs of any germs.</text></h2><h2 title="Choose the Right Gloves"><text>Containers of disposable gloves should be available in any room or area where patient care takes place.</text><text>Gloves come in different sizes, so make sure you choose the right size for a good fit.</text><detail>If the gloves are too big, it is hard to hold objects and easier for germs to get inside your gloves.</detail><detail>Gloves that are too small are more likely to rip. </detail><text>Some cleaning and care procedures require sterile or surgical gloves. Sterile means "free from germs." These gloves come in numbered sizes (5.5 to 9). Know your size ahead of time.</text><text>If you will be handling chemicals, check the material safety data sheet to see what kind of gloves you will need.</text><text>DO NOT use oil-based hand creams or lotions unless they are approved for use with latex gloves.</text><text>If you have a latex allergy, use non-latex gloves and avoid contact with other products that contain latex.</text></h2><h2 title="Removing Gloves"><text>When you take gloves off, make sure the outsides of the gloves do not touch your bare hands. Follow these steps:</text><detail>Grab the top of your right glove with your left hand.</detail><detail>Pull toward your fingertips. The glove will turn inside out.</detail><detail>Hold onto the empty glove with your left hand.</detail><detail>Put 2 right-hand fingers in the top of your left glove.</detail><detail>Pull toward your fingertips until you have pulled the glove inside out and off your hand. The right glove will be inside the left glove now.</detail><detail>Throw the gloves away in an approved waste container. </detail><text>Always use new gloves for each patient.

<item><title>Ways to burn more calories every day</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000894.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>If you are trying to lose weight, you need to cut back on how many calories you eat. But you can boost your weight loss efforts by burning more calories every day. This makes it easier to take off extra weight.</text></h2><h2 title="Being More Active Burns More Calories"><text>Any kind of physical activity uses energy. The more work the activity takes, the more calories you burn. Even fidgeting burns calories more calories than sitting still. </text><text>Here is a comparison of different activities and how many calories a 170-pound (77 kilograms) person can burn in an hour.</text><detail>Standing burns more calories than sitting (186 calories vs. 139 calories).</detail><detail>Walking at a moderate pace burns more calories than standing (324 calories vs. 186 calories).</detail><detail>Walking briskly burns more calories than moderate-paced walking (371 calories vs. 324 calories).</detail><text>Look for ways to be more active every day. Even small changes, such as standing instead of sitting while on the phone, can add up to 100 calories a day or more. Start with the suggestions below and come up with your own ideas.</text><text>Always talk to your health care provider before starting a new exercise program especially if you are not already exercising regularly.</text></h2><h2 title="Ways to Move More"><detail>Stand up. The muscles in your back and legs do extra work when you stand. To burn even more calories, pace back and forth while you talk on the phone. If you have a desk job, see if you can get a standing desk, or rig one up, and spend part of the day standing while you work.</detail><detail>Take regular breaks. People who often take breaks from sitting burn more calories than people who sit in one place for hours on end. Just getting up for a quick stretch will break up your sitting time.</detail><detail>Walk more. Walk to the bathroom on the other end of the building. Park at the far end of the parking lot. Get off the bus or subway several stops ahead and walk the rest of the way. Always be on the lookout for ways you can add more walking to your life.</detail><detail>Stand on one foot. While standing, lift one foot an inch (2.5 centimeters) off the ground, see how long you can hold that position, then change feet. You will work your leg muscles, core muscles, and improve your balance.</detail><detail>Put your shoes on standing up. This is another great exercise for balance. See if you can put on your sock, shoe, and tie your shoe without letting your foot touch the ground.</detail><detail>Be in a hurry. Walking fast burns more calories than a slow stroll. Make a game out of seeing how quickly you can get to your destination.</detail><detail>Take the stairs. If you have to get to the 11th floor, walk up as many flights as you can, then take the elevator the rest of the way. Stair climbing is one of the easiest activities you can do to burn calories without going to a gym.</detail><detail>Plan active parties. If you have guests over for a BBQ or dinner party, start the evening with a game of volleyball, badminton, or an active video game. Make social events active by meeting to go bowling, throw darts, or play pool.</detail><detail>Wear a tracking device. Wearable activity monitors can tell you how active you have been on a given day. You might set a daily goal for yourself, or get a friend to join you in a friendly competition. Seeing how adding extra activities add to your daily results can inspire you to do even more.</detail><detail>Add music. Listening to music while you walk can make the activity more fun and take your mind off what you are doing. Pick an upbeat tune, and you may find you up the intensity without realizing it.</detail><detail>Watch less TV. Television remains one of the biggest draws for sitting marathons. If you are hooked on a certain show, tune in and then hit the off button as soon as your show ends. You could also try standing up while you watch or doing pushups, crunches, or squats every time a commercial comes on. Only allowing yourself to watch your favorite show at the gym can help motivate you to get in your workouts.</detail><detail>Do your shopping in person. When you physically go to a store to shop, you walk to the building, take the stairs, walk the aisles, reach for things, and lift and carry bags. Compare that to the tiny movements involved in online shopping.</detail><detail>Do it yourself. Prepackaged foods, snow blowers, riding mowers and other conveniences are all great time-saving inventions. But as things get easier, it gets harder to balance the calories you eat with the energy you use. Cooking from scratch, cutting the grass with a push mower, and shoveling the walk all make you move. And the more you move, the more you burn, and the healthier you will be. </detail></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>Weight loss - burning calories; Overweight - burning calories; Obesity - burning calories; Physical activity - burning calories; Staying active - burning calories</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 4/23/2018"><text>Updated by: Emily Wax, RD, The Brooklyn Hospital Center, Brooklyn, NY.

Learning and practicing water safety is important to prevent drowning accidents.</text></h2><h2 title="Water Safety"><text>Water safety tips for all ages include:</text><detail>Learn CPR.</detail><detail>Never swim alone.</detail><detail>Never dive into water unless you know beforehand how deep it is.</detail><detail>Know your limits. DO NOT go into areas of water that you cannot handle.</detail><detail>Stay out of strong currents even if you are strong swimmer.</detail><detail>Learn about rip currents and undertows and how to swim out of them.</detail><detail>Always wear life preservers when boating, even if you know how to swim.</detail><detail>DO NOT overload your boat. If your boat turns over, stay with the boat until help arrives. </detail><text>DO NOT drink alcohol before or during swimming, boating, or water skiing. DO NOT drink alcohol while supervising children around water.</text><text>When boating, know local weather conditions and forecasts. Watch for dangerous waves and rip currents.</text></h2><h2 title="Children and Water Safety"><text>Put a fence around all home swimming pools.</text><detail>The fence should completely separate the yard and house from the pool.</detail><detail>The fence should be 4 feet (120 centimeters) or higher.</detail><detail>The latch to the fence should be self-closing and out of the reach of children.</detail><detail>Keep the gate closed and latched at all times. </detail><text>When leaving the pool, put away all toys from the pool and deck. This helps remove temptation for children to enter the pool area.</text><text>At least one responsible adult should supervise young children when they swim or play in or around water.</text><detail>The adult should be close enough to reach a child at all times.</detail><detail>Supervising adults should not be reading, talking on the phone, or doing any other activities that keep them from watching the child or children at all times.</detail><detail>Never leave young children unattended in a wading pool, swimming pool, lake, ocean, or stream -- not even for a second. </detail><text>Teach your children to swim. But understand that this alone will not prevent young children from drowning. Air-filled or foam toys (wings, noodles, and inner tubes) are not a replacement for life jackets when boating or when your child is in open water.</text><text>Prevent drowning around the home:</text><detail>All buckets, wading pools, ice chests, and other containers should be emptied right after use and stored upside down.</detail><detail>Learn to practice good bathroom safety measures, as well. Keep toilet lids closed. Use toilet seat locks until your children are around 3 years old. DO NOT leave young children unattended while they take baths.</detail><detail>Keep doors to your laundry room and bathrooms closed at all times. Consider installing latches on these doors that your child cannot reach.</detail><detail>Be aware of irrigation ditches and other areas of water drainage around your home. These also create drowning dangers for small children. </detail></h2><h2 title="Review Date 9/5/2017"><text>Updated by: Neil K.

<item><title>Warning signs and symptoms of heart disease</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000775.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>Heart disease often develops over time. You may have early signs or symptoms long before you have serious heart problems. Or you may not realize you are developing heart disease. The warning signs of heart disease may not be obvious. Also, not every person has the same symptoms.</text><text>Certain symptoms, such as chest pain, ankle swelling, and shortness of breath may be signals that something is wrong. Learning the warning signs can help you get treatment and help prevent a heart attack or stroke.</text></h2><h2 title="Chest Pain"><text>Chest pain is discomfort or pain that you feel along the front of your body, between your neck and upper abdomen. There are many causes of chest pain that have nothing to do with your heart.</text><text>But chest pain is still the most common symptom of poor blood flow to the heart or a heart attack. This type of chest pain is called angina.</text><text>Chest pain can occur when the heart is not getting enough blood or oxygen. The amount and type of pain can vary from person to person. The intensity of the pain does not always relate to how severe the problem is.</text><detail>Some people may feel a crushing pain, while others feel only mild discomfort.</detail><detail>Your chest may feel heavy or like someone is squeezing your heart. You may also feel a sharp, burning pain in your chest.</detail><detail>You may feel the pain under your breastbone (sternum), or in your neck, arms, stomach, jaw, or upper back.</detail><detail>Chest pain from angina often occurs with activity or emotion, and goes away with rest or a medicine called nitroglycerin.</detail><detail>Bad indigestion can also cause chest pain.</detail><text>Women, older adults, and people with diabetes may have little or no chest pain. They are more likely to have symptoms other than chest pain, such as:</text><detail>Fatigue</detail><detail>Shortness of breath</detail><detail>General weakness</detail><detail>Change in skin color or greyish pallor (episodes of change in skin color associated with weakness)</detail><text>Other symptoms of a heart attack can include:</text><detail>Extreme anxiety</detail><detail>Fainting or loss of consciousness</detail><detail>Lightheadedness or dizziness</detail><detail>Nausea or vomiting</detail><detail>Palpitations (feeling like your heart is beating too fast or irregularly)</detail><detail>Shortness of breath</detail><detail>Sweating, which may be very heavy</detail></h2><h2 title="Shortness of Breath"><text>When the heart can't pump blood as well as it should, blood backs up in the veins that go from the lungs to the heart. Fluid leaks into the lungs and causes shortness of breath. This is a symptom of heart failure.</text><text>You may notice shortness of breath:</text><detail>During activity</detail><detail>While you're resting</detail><detail>When you're lying flat on your back -- it may even wake you from sleep </detail></h2><h2 title="Coughing or Wheezing"><text>Coughing or wheezing that doesn't go away can be another sign that fluid is building up in your lungs. You may also cough up mucus that is pink or bloody.</text></h2><h2 title="Swelling in the Legs, Ankles, or Feet"><text>Swelling (edema) in your lower legs is another sign of a heart problem. When your heart doesn't work as well, blood flow slows and backs up in the veins in your legs. This causes fluid to build up in your tissues.</text><text>You may also have swelling in your stomach or notice some weight gain.</text></h2><h2 title="Narrowed Blood Vessels"><text>Narrowing of the blood vessels that bring blood to other parts of the body may mean you have a much higher risk for heart attack. It can occur when cholesterol and other fatty material (plaque) build up on the walls of your arteries.</text><text>Poor blood supply to the legs may lead to:</text><detail>Pain, achiness, fatigue, burning, or discomfort in the muscles of your feet, calves, or thighs.</detail><detail>Symptoms that often appear during walking or exercise, and go away after several minutes of rest.</detail><detail>Numbness in your legs or feet when you are at rest. Your legs may also feel cool to the touch, and the skin may look pale.</detail><text>A stroke occurs when blood flow to a part of the brain stops. A stroke is sometimes called a "brain attack." Symptoms of stroke can include difficulty moving the limbs on one side of your body, one side of the face drooping, difficulty with speaking or understanding language.</text></h2><h2 title="Fatigue"><text>Tiredness can have many causes. Often it simply means that you need more rest. But feeling run down can be a sign of a more serious problem. Fatigue may be a sign of heart trouble when:</text><detail>You feel much more tired than normal. It's common for women to feel severely tired before or during a heart attack.</detail><detail>You feel so tired that you can't do your normal daily activities.</detail><detail>You have sudden, severe weakness. </detail></h2><h2 title="Fast or Uneven Heartbeat (Palpitations)"><text>If your heart can't pump blood as well, it may beat faster to try to keep up. You may feel your heart racing or throbbing. A fast or uneven heartbeat can also be the sign of an arrhythmia. This is a problem with your heart rate or rhythm.</text></h2><h2 title="When to Call the Doctor"><text>If you have any signs of heart disease, call your health care provider right away. Don't wait to see if the symptoms go away or dismiss them as nothing.</text><text>Call your local emergency number (such as 911) if:</text><detail>You have chest pain or other symptoms of a heart attack</detail><detail>If you know you have angina and have chest pain that doesn't go away after 5 minutes of rest or after taking nitroglycerine </detail><detail>If you think you may be having a heart attack</detail><detail>If you become extremely short of breath</detail><detail>If you think you may have lost consciousness</detail></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>Angina - heart disease warning signs; Chest pain - heart disease warning signs; Dyspnea - heart disease warning signs; Edema - heart disease warning signs; Palpitations - heart disease warning signs</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 9/26/2016"><text>Updated by: Michael A.

<item><title>Your cancer care team</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000929.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>As part of your cancer treatment plan, you will likely work with a team of health care providers. Learn about the types of providers you may work with and what they do.</text></h2><h2 title="Oncologists"><text>Oncology is the field of medicine that covers cancer care and treatment. A doctor who works in this field is called an oncologist. There are several types of oncologists. They may have titles based on who or what they treat. For instance, a pediatric oncologist treats cancer in children. A gynecologic oncologist treats cancer in women's reproductive organs. </text><text>Oncologists may also have titles based on the type of treatment they use. These oncologists include:</text><detail>Medical oncologist. A doctor who diagnoses cancer and treats it using medicine. These drugs can include chemotherapy. Your primary cancer doctor may be a medical oncologist.</detail><detail>Radiation oncologist. A doctor who uses radiation to treat cancer. Radiation is used to either kill cancer cells, or damage them so that they cannot grow any more.</detail><detail>Surgical oncologist. A doctor who treats cancer using surgery. Surgery can be used to remove cancer tumors from the body. </detail></h2><h2 title="Other Cancer Care Providers"><text>Other members of your cancer care team may include the following:</text><detail>Anesthesiologist. A doctor who provides medicine that keeps people from feeling pain. Anesthesia is most often used during surgery. When you have surgery, it puts you into a deep sleep. You will not feel anything or remember the surgery afterward.</detail><detail>Case manager. A provider who oversees your cancer care from diagnosis through recovery. They work with you and your whole care team to help make sure you have the health care services and resources you need.</detail><detail>Genetic counselor. A provider who can help you make decisions about hereditary cancer (cancer passed down through your genes). A genetic counselor can help you or your family members decide if you want to get tested for these types of cancer. A counselor can also help you make decisions based on test results.</detail><detail>Nurse practitioners. A nurse with a graduate degree in advanced practice nursing. A nurse practitioner will work along with your cancer doctors to provide your care, in the clinic, and in the hospital.</detail><detail>Patient navigators. A provider who will work with you and your family to help you with all aspects of getting health care. This includes finding health care providers, helping with insurance issues, helping with paperwork, and explaining your health care or treatment options. The goal is to help you overcome any barriers to getting the best care possible.</detail><detail>Oncology social worker. A provider who can help you and your family deal with emotional and social issues. An oncology social worker can connect you with resources and help you with any insurance problems. They can also provide guidance on how to cope with cancer and how to make arrangements about your treatment.</detail><detail>Pathologist. A doctor who diagnoses diseases using tests in a laboratory. They can look at tissue samples under a microscope to see if they contain cancer. A pathologist can also find out what stage the cancer is in.</detail><detail>Radiologist. A doctor who performs and explains tests such as x-rays, CT scans, and MRIs (magnetic resonance imaging). A radiologist uses these types of tests to diagnose and stage diseases.</detail><detail>Registered dietitian (RD). A provider who is an expert in food and nutrition. An RD can help create a diet for you that will help keep you strong during cancer treatment. When your cancer treatment is done, an RD can also help you find foods that will help your body heal. </detail></h2><h2 title="Working with Your Care Team"><text>Each member of your care team plays an important role. But it may be hard to keep track of what each person does for you. DO NOT hesitate to ask someone what they do and how they will help you.

But you may need to avoid some yoga poses or modify poses if you:</text><detail>Are pregnant</detail><detail>Have high blood pressure</detail><detail>Have glaucoma</detail><detail>Have sciatica</detail><text>Make sure to tell your yoga instructor if you have any of these conditions or any other health problem or injury. A qualified yoga teacher should be able to help you find poses that are safe for you.</text></h2><h2 title="Styles of Yoga"><text>There are many different types or styles of yoga. They range from mild to more intense. Some of the more popular styles of yoga are:</text><detail>Ashtanga or power yoga. This type of yoga offers a more demanding workout. In these classes, you quickly move from one posture to another.</detail><detail>Bikram or hot yoga. You do a series of 26 poses in a room heated to 95°F to 100°F (35°C to 37.8°C).

If you are new to yoga, start with a beginner class. Talk with the instructor before the class and tell them about any injuries or health conditions you may have.</text><text>You may want to ask about the instructor's training and experience. However, while most instructors have had some formal training, there are no certified yoga training programs. Choose an instructor you enjoy working with who does not push you in ways you are not comfortable.</text></h2><h2 title="What to Expect"><text>Most yoga classes last from 45 to 90 minutes. All styles of yoga include three basic components:</text><detail>Breathing. Focusing on your breath is an important part of yoga. Your teacher may offer instruction on breathing exercising during the class.</detail><detail>Poses. Yoga poses, or postures, are a series of movements that help boost strength, flexibility, and balance. They range in difficulty from lying flat on the floor to difficult balancing poses.</detail><detail>Meditation. Yoga classes usually end with a short period of meditation. This quiets the mind and helps you relax. </detail></h2><h2 title="How to Prevent Injury"><text>While yoga is generally safe, you can still get hurt if you do a pose incorrectly or push yourself too far. Here are some tips to stay safe when doing yoga.</text><detail>If you have a health condition, talk with your health care provider before starting yoga. Ask if there are any poses you should avoid.</detail><detail>Start slowly and learn the basics before pushing yourself too far.</detail><detail>Choose a class that is appropriate for your level. If you are not sure, ask the teacher.</detail><detail>DO NOT push yourself beyond your comfort level.

Atopic dermatitis is the most common type.</text><text>Atopic dermatitis is due to a skin reaction pattern, similar to an allergy, that causes long-term inflammation of the skin. Most people with atopic dermatitis also are missing certain proteins from the surface of the skin. These proteins are important in maintaining the skin barrier function. As a result, their skin is more easily irritated by minor irritants.</text><text>Taking care of your skin at home may reduce the need for medicines.</text></h2><h2 title="Alternative names"><text>Eczema - self-care</text></h2><h2 title="Help for Itching and Scratching"><text>Try not to scratch the rash or your skin in the inflamed area.</text><detail>Relieve the itch by using moisturizers, topical steroids, or other prescribed creams.</detail><detail>Keep your child's fingernails cut short. Consider light gloves if nighttime scratching is a problem. </detail><text>Antihistamines taken by mouth may help with itching if you have allergies. Often you can buy them over-the-counter. Some antihistamines can cause sleepiness. But they may help with scratching while you sleep. Newer antihistamines cause little or no sleepiness. These include:</text><detail>Fexofenadine (Allegra)</detail><detail>Loratadine (Claritin, Alavert)</detail><detail>Cetirizine (Zyrtec)</detail><text>Benadryl or hydroxyzine may be taken at night time to relieve itching and allow for sleep.</text></h2><h2 title="Day-to-day Skin Care"><text>Keep the skin lubricated or moisturized. Use ointment (such as petroleum jelly), cream, or lotion 2 to 3 times a day. Moisturizers should be free of alcohol, scents, dyes, fragrances, or chemicals you know you are allergic to. Having a humidifier in the home may also help.</text><text>Moisturizers and emollients work best when they are applied to skin that is wet or damp. These products soften the skin and help it retain moisture. After washing or bathing, pat the skin dry and then apply the moisturizer right away.</text><text>Different types of emollients or moisturizers may be used at different times of the day. For the most part, you can apply these substances as often as you need to keep your skin soft.</text><text>Avoid anything that you observe makes your symptoms worse.

Short, cooler baths are better than long, hot baths.</detail><detail>Use gentle skin care cleansers rather than traditional soaps. Use these products only on your face, underarms, genital areas, hands, and feet, or to remove visible dirt.</detail><detail>DO NOT scrub or dry the skin too hard or for too long.</detail><detail>After bathing, it is important to apply lubricating cream, lotion, or ointment on the skin while it is damp. This will help trap moisture in the skin.</detail><text>The rash itself, as well as the scratching, often causes breaks in the skin and may lead to infection. Keep an eye out for redness, warmth, swelling, or other signs of infection.</text></h2><h2 title="Medicines From Your Doctor"><text>Topical corticosteroids are medicines used to treat conditions where your skin becomes red, sore, or inflamed. "Topical" means you place it on the skin. Topical corticosteroids may also be called topical steroids or topical cortisones. These medicines help "calm" your skin when it is irritated.. Your provider will tell you how much of this medicine to use and how often. DO NOT use more medicine or use it more often than you are told.</text><text>You may need other prescription medicines such as barrier repair creams.

<item><title>Atopic dermatitis - children - homecare</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000939.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>Atopic dermatitis is a long-term (chronic) skin disorder that involves scaly and itchy rashes. It's also called eczema. The condition is due to a hypersensitive skin reaction that is similar to an allergy. This leads to ongoing inflammation of the skin.</text><text>Atopic dermatitis is most common in infants and children. It may start as early as age 2 to 6 months. Many people outgrow it by early adulthood. </text><text>This condition can be difficult to control in children, so it's important to work closely with your child's health care provider. Daily skin care is important to help prevent flares and keep the skin from being inflamed.</text></h2><h2 title="Help for Itching and Scratching"><text>Severe itching is common. Itching may start even before the rash appears. Atopic dermatitis is often called the "itch that rashes" because the itching starts, and then the skin rash follows as a result of scratching.</text><text>To help your child avoid scratching:</text><detail>Use a moisturizer, topical steroid cream, or other medicine the child's provider prescribes.</detail><detail>Keep your child's fingernails cut short. Have them wear light gloves while sleeping if scratching at night is a problem.</detail><detail>Give antihistamines or other medicines by mouth as prescribed by your child's provider.</detail><detail>As much as possible, teach older children not to scratch itchy skin. </detail></h2><h2 title="Day-to-Day Skin Care"><text>Daily skin care with allergen- free products may cut down on the need for medicines.</text><text>Use moisturizing ointments (such as petroleum jelly), creams, or lotions.

Watch for signs that your child feels frustrated or stressed and teach them ways to reduce stress such as taking deep breaths or thinking about things they enjoy.</detail><detail>Triggers that cause allergy symptoms. Do what you can to keep your home free of allergy triggers such as mold, dust, and pet dander.</detail><detail>Avoid using skin care products that contain alcohol. </detail><text>Using moisturizers, creams, or ointments every day as directed may help prevent flares.</text></h2><h2 title="Medicines from the Doctor"><text>Antihistamines taken by mouth may help if allergies cause your child's itchy skin. These medicines are often available over the counter and do not require a prescription. Ask your child's provider what kind is right for your child.</text><text>Atopic dermatitis is usually treated with medicines placed directly on the skin or scalp. These are called topical medicines:</text><detail>The provider will probably prescribe a mild cortisone (steroid) cream or ointment at first.

The doctor uses them to guide the baby's head out of the birth canal. The mother will push the baby the rest of the way out.</text><text>Another technique your doctor may use to deliver the baby is called vacuum assisted delivery.</text></h2><h2 title="When is a Forceps Delivery Needed?"><text>Even after your cervix is fully dilated (open) and you have been pushing, you may still need help getting the baby out. Reasons include:</text><detail>After pushing for several hours, the baby may be close to coming out, but needs help to get through the last part of the birth canal.</detail><detail>You may be too tired to push any longer.</detail><detail>A medical problem may make it risky for you to push.</detail><detail>The baby may be showing signs of stress and need to come out faster than you can push it out on your own </detail><text>Before forceps can be used, your baby needs to be far enough down the birth canal. The baby's head and face must also be in the right position. Your doctor will check carefully to make sure it is safe to use forceps.</text><text>Most women will not need forceps to help them deliver. You may feel tired and tempted to ask for a little help. But if there is not a true need for assisted delivery, it is safer for you and your baby to deliver on your own.</text></h2><h2 title="What Will Happen to me During a Forceps-assisted Vaginal Delivery?"><text>You will be given medicine to block pain. This may be an epidural block or a numbing medicine placed in the vagina.</text><text>The forceps will be carefully placed on the baby's head. Then, during a contraction, you will be asked to push again. At the same time, the doctor will gently pull to help deliver your baby. </text><text>After the doctor delivers the baby's head, you will push the baby the rest of the way out. After delivery, you can hold your baby on your tummy if he or she is doing well. </text><text>If the forceps do not help move your baby, you may need to have a cesarean birth (C-section).</text></h2><h2 title="What are the Risks?"><text>Most forceps-assisted vaginal births are safe when they are done correctly by an experienced doctor. They may decrease the need for a C-section. </text><text>However, there are some risks with forceps delivery.</text><text>For the mother, they are:</text><detail>More severe tears to the vagina which may require prolonged healing time and (rarely) surgery to correct</detail><detail>Problems with urinating or moving your bowels after delivery </detail><text>For the baby, the risks are:</text><detail>Bumps, bruises or marks on the baby's head or face. They will heal in a few days or weeks.</detail><detail>The head may swell or be cone-shaped. It should return to normal usually within a day or two.</detail><detail>The baby's nerves may be injured by pressure from the forceps. The baby's face muscles may droop if the nerves are injured, but they will go back to normal when the nerves heal.</detail><detail>The baby may be cut from the forceps and bleed. This rarely happens.</detail><detail>There may be bleeding inside the baby's head. This is more serious, but very rare. </detail><text>Most of these risks are not severe. When properly used, forceps rarely cause lasting problems.</text></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>Pregnancy - forceps; Labor - forceps</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 4/19/2018"><text>Updated by: John D.

<item><title>Antibiotic resistance</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000957.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>Using antibiotics incorrectly can cause some bacteria to change. These changes make bacteria stronger, so most or all antibiotic medicines no longer work to kill them. This is called antibiotic resistance. Resistant bacteria continue to grow and multiply, making infections harder to treat.</text></h2><h2 title="Information"><text>Antibiotics work by killing bacteria or keeping them from growing. Resistant bacteria keep growing, even when antibiotics are used. This problem is seen most often in hospitals and nursing homes.</text><text>New antibiotics are created to work against some resistant bacteria. But there are now bacteria that no known antibiotic can kill. Infections with such bacteria are dangerous. Because of this, antibiotic resistance has become a major health concern.</text></h2><h2 title="Causes of Antibiotic Resistance"><text>Antibiotic overuse is a main cause of antibiotic resistance. This occurs in both humans and animals. Certain practices increase the risk of resistant bacteria:</text><detail>Using antibiotics when not needed. Most colds, sore throats, and ear and sinus infections are caused by viruses. Antibiotics don't work against viruses. Many people don't understand this and often ask for antibiotics when not needed. This leads to an overuse of antibiotics. The CDC estimates that 1 in 3 antibiotic prescriptions are not needed.</detail><detail>Not taking antibiotics as prescribed. This includes not taking all of your antibiotics, missing doses, or using leftover antibiotics. Doing so helps the bacteria learn how to grow in spite of the antibiotic. As a result, the infection may not fully respond to treatment the next time the antibiotic is used.</detail><detail>Misuse of antibiotics. You should never buy antibiotics online without a prescription or take someone else's antibiotics.</detail><detail>Exposure from food sources. Antibiotics are widely used in agriculture. This can lead to resistant bacteria in the food supply. </detail></h2><h2 title="Why Antibiotic Resistance Is a Concern"><text>Antibiotic resistance causes a number of problems:</text><detail>The need for stronger antibiotics with possibly severe side effects</detail><detail>More expensive treatment</detail><detail>Harder-to-treat illness spread from person to person</detail><detail>More hospitalizations and longer stays </detail><detail>Serious health problems, and even death&lt;br&gt;</detail></h2><h2 title="How Antibiotic Resistant Bacteria Spread"><text>Antibiotic resistance can spread from person to person or from animals to humans.</text><text>In people, it may spread from:</text><detail>One patient to other patients or staff in a nursing home, urgent care center, or hospital</detail><detail>Health care staff to other staff or to patients</detail><detail>Patients to other people who come in contact with the patient</detail><text>Antibiotic resistant bacteria may spread from animals to humans through:</text><detail>Food sprayed with water that contains antibiotic resistant bacteria from animal feces &lt;br&gt;</detail></h2><h2 title="Help Prevent Antibiotic Resistance"><text>To prevent antibiotic resistance from spreading: </text><detail>Antibiotics should only be used as directed and when prescribed by a doctor.</detail><detail>Unused antibiotics should be discarded safely. </detail><detail>Antibiotics should not be prescribed or used for viral infections. </detail></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>Antimicrobials - resistance; Antimicrobial agents - resistance; Drug-resistant bacteria </text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 6/5/2018"><text>Updated by: Jatin M.

<item><title>Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury - aftercare</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000681.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>A ligament is a band of tissue that connects a bone to another bone. The anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) is located inside your knee joint and connects the bones of your upper and lower leg. </text><text>An ACL injury occurs when the ligament is stretched or torn. A partial ACL tear occurs when only part of the ligament is torn. A complete ACL tear occurs when the entire ligament is torn into two pieces.</text></h2><h2 title="More About Your Injury"><text>The ACL is one of several ligaments that keep your knee stable. It helps keep your leg bones in place and allows your knee to move back and forth.</text><text>An ACL injury can occur if you:</text><detail>Get hit very hard on the side of your knee, such as during a football tackle</detail><detail>Twist your knee</detail><detail>Quickly stop moving and change direction while running, landing from a jump, or turning </detail><text>Skiers and people who play basketball, football, or soccer are more likely to have this type of injury. Women are more likely to tear their ACL than men when they participate in sports.</text></h2><h2 title="What to Expect"><text>It is common to hear a "popping" sound when an ACL injury occurs. You also may have:</text><detail>Knee swelling within a few hours of injury</detail><detail>Knee pain, especially when you try to put weight on the injured leg </detail><text>If you have a mild injury, you may notice that your knee feels unstable or seems to "give way" when using it. ACL injuries often occur along with other knee injuries, such as to the meniscus and cartilage. These injuries may also need to be treated with surgery.</text><text>After examining your knee, your doctor may order these imaging tests:</text><detail>An MRI of the knee. An MRI machine takes special pictures of the tissues inside your knee. The pictures will show whether these tissues have been stretched or torn.</detail><detail>X-rays to check for damage to the bones in your knee. </detail><text>If you have an ACL injury, you may need:</text><detail>Crutches to walk until the swelling and pain get better</detail><detail>A brace to support and stabilize your knee</detail><detail>Physical therapy to help improve joint motion and leg strength</detail><detail>Surgery to reconstruct the ACL</detail><text>Some people can live and function normally with a torn ACL. However, most people feel like their knee is unstable and may "give out" with more rigorous activities. Unrepaired ACL tears can lead to further knee damage.</text></h2><h2 title="Self-care at Home"><text>Follow R.I.C.E. to help reduce pain and swelling:</text><detail>Rest your leg.

<item><title>Ankle sprain - aftercare</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000574.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>
Ligaments are strong, flexible tissues that attach your bones to one another. They keep your joints stable and help them move in the right ways.</text><text>An ankle sprain occurs when the ligaments in your ankle are stretched or torn.</text></h2><h2 title="More about Your Injury "><text>There are 3 grades of ankle sprains:</text><detail>Grade I sprains: Your ligaments are stretched. It is a mild injury that can improve with some light stretching.</detail><detail>Grade II sprains: Your ligaments are partially torn. You may need to wear a splint or a cast.</detail><detail>Grade III sprains: Your ligaments are fully torn. You may need surgery for this severe injury. </detail><text>The last 2 kinds of sprains are often associated with tearing of small blood vessels. This allows blood to leak into tissues and cause black and blue color in the area. The blood may not appear for several days. Most of the time it is absorbed from the tissues within 2 weeks.</text><text>If your sprain is more severe:</text><detail>You may feel strong pain and have a lot of swelling.</detail><detail>You may not be able to walk, or walking may be painful. </detail><text>Some ankle sprains may become chronic (long-lasting). If this happens to you, your ankle may continue to be:</text><detail>Painful and swollen</detail><detail>Weak or giving way easily </detail></h2><h2 title="What to Expect "><text>Your health care provider may order an x-ray to look for a bone fracture, or an MRI scan to look for an injury to the ligament. </text><text>To help your ankle heal, your provider may treat you with a brace, a cast, or a splint, and may give you crutches to walk on. You may be asked to place only part or none of your weight on the bad ankle. You will also need to do physical therapy or exercises to help you recover from the injury.</text></h2><h2 title="Self-care "><text>You can decrease swelling by:</text><detail>Resting and not putting weight on your foot</detail><detail>Elevating your foot on a pillow at or above the level of your heart </detail><text>Apply ice every hour while you are awake, 20 minutes at a time and covered by a towel or bag, for the first 24 hours after the injury. After the first 24 hours, apply ice 20 minutes 3 to 4 times per day. DO NOT apply ice directly to your skin. You should wait at least 30 minutes in between ice applications.</text><text>Pain medicines, such as ibuprofen or naproxen, may help to ease pain and swelling. You can buy these medicines without a prescription.</text><detail>DO NOT use these drugs for the first 24 hours after your injury. They may increase the risk of bleeding.</detail><detail>Talk with your provider before using these medicines if you have heart disease, high blood pressure, kidney disease, liver disease, or have had stomach ulcers or internal bleeding in the past.</detail><detail>DO NOT take more than the amount recommended on the bottle or more than your provider advises you to take. Carefully read the warnings on the label before taking any medicine. </detail><text>During the first 24 hours after your injury you may take acetaminophen (Tylenol and others) if your provider tells you it is safe to do so. People with liver disease should not take this medicine.</text></h2><h2 title="Getting Active "><text>The pain and swelling of an ankle sprain most often gets better within 48 hours. After that, you can begin to put weight back on your injured foot.</text><detail>Put only as much weight on your foot as is comfortable at first. Slowly work your way up to your full weight.</detail><detail>If your ankle begins to hurt, stop and rest. </detail><text>Your provider will give you exercises to strengthen your foot and ankle. Doing these exercises can help prevent future sprains and chronic ankle pain.</text><text>For less severe sprains, you may be able to go back to your normal activities after a few days. For more severe sprains, it may take several weeks.</text><text>Talk to your provider before returning to more intense sports or work activities. </text></h2><h2 title="When to Call the Doctor"><text>You should call your provider if you notice any of the following:</text><detail>You cannot walk, or walking is very painful.</detail><detail>The pain does not get better after ice, rest, and pain medicine.</detail><detail>Your ankle does not feel any better after 5 to 7 days.</detail><detail>Your ankle continues to feel weak or gives away easily.</detail><detail>Your ankle is increasingly discolored (red or black and blue), or it becomes numb or tingly. </detail></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>Lateral ankle sprain - aftercare; Medial ankle sprain - aftercare; Medial ankle injury - aftercare; Ankle syndesmosis sprain - aftercare; Syndesmosis injury - aftercare; ATFL injury - aftercare; CFL injury - aftercare</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 11/27/2016"><text>Updated by: C.

Compared with adults, children are much more likely to be bitten on the face, head, or neck.</text><text>Cat bites are less common but have a higher risk for infection. Cat teeth are longer and sharper, which can cause deeper puncture wounds. Most other animal bites are caused by stray or wild animals, such as skunks, raccoons, foxes, and bats.</text><text>Bites that cause a puncture wound are more likely to become infected.

<item><title>Angioplasty and stent - heart - discharge </title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000091.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>You had angioplasty when you were in the hospital. You may have also had a stent placed. Both of these were done to open narrowed or blocked coronary arteries, the blood vessels that supply blood to your heart. You may have had a heart attack or angina (chest pain) before the procedure.</text></h2><h2 title="What to Expect at Home"><text>You may have pain in your groin area, arm, or wrist. This is from the catheter (flexible tube) that was inserted to do the procedure. You may also have some bruising around and below the incision.</text><text>The chest pain and shortness of breath you likely had before the procedure should be much better now.</text></h2><h2 title="Self-care "><text>In general, people who have angioplasty can walk around within 6 hours after the procedure. Complete recovery takes a week or less. Keep the area where the catheter was inserted dry for 24 to 48 hours.</text><text>If the doctor put the catheter in through your groin:</text><detail>Walking short distances on a flat surface is OK. Limit going up and down stairs to around 2 times a day for the first 2 to 3 days.</detail><detail>DO NOT do yard work, drive, squat, carry heavy objects, or play sports for at least 2 days, or until your health care provider tells you it is safe. </detail><text>If the doctor put the catheter in your arm or wrist:</text><detail>DO NOT lift anything heavier than 10 pounds (4.5 kg) (a little more than a gallon of milk) with the arm that had the catheter.</detail><detail>DO NOT do any heavy pushing, pulling or twisting with that arm. </detail><text>For a catheter in your groin, arm, or wrist:</text><detail>Avoid sexual activity for 2 to 5 days. Ask your provider when it will be OK to start again.</detail><detail>DO NOT take a bath or swim for the first week. You may take showers, but make sure the area where the catheter was inserted does not get wet for the first 24 to 48 hours.</detail><detail>You should be able to return to work in 2 to 3 days if you do not do heavy work. </detail><text>You will need to care for your incision.</text><detail>Your provider will tell you how often to change your dressing.</detail><detail>If your incision bleeds or swells up, lie down and put pressure on it for 30 minutes. </detail><text>Angioplasty does not cure the cause of the blockage in your arteries. Your arteries may become narrow again. Eat a heart-healthy diet, exercise, stop smoking (if you smoke), and reduce stress to help lower your chances of having a blocked artery again. Your provider may give you medicine to help lower your cholesterol.</text><text>Most people take aspirin together with another antiplatelet medicine such as clopidogrel (Plavix), prasugrel (Efient), or ticagrelor (Brilinta) after this procedure. These medicines are blood thinners. They keep your blood from forming clots in your arteries and stent. A blood clot can lead to a heart attack. Take the medicines exactly as your provider tells you. DO NOT stop taking them without talking with your provider first.</text><text>You should know how to take care of your angina if it returns.</text><text>Make sure you have a follow-up appointment scheduled with your heart doctor (cardiologist).</text><text>Your doctor may refer you to a cardiac rehabilitation program. This will help you learn how to slowly increase your exercise. You will also learn how to take care of your angina and care for yourself after a heart attack.</text></h2><h2 title="When to Call the Doctor"><text>Call your doctor if:</text><detail>There is bleeding at the catheter insertion site that does not stop when you apply pressure.</detail><detail>There is swelling at the catheter site.</detail><detail>Your leg or arm below where the catheter was inserted changes color, becomes cool to touch, or is numb.</detail><detail>The small incision for your catheter becomes red or painful, or yellow or green discharge is draining from it.</detail><detail>You have chest pain or shortness of breath that does not go away with rest.</detail><detail>Your pulse feels irregular -- very slow (fewer than 60 beats), or very fast (over 100 to 120 beats) a minute.</detail><detail>You have dizziness, fainting, or you are very tired.</detail><detail>You are coughing up blood or yellow or green mucus.</detail><detail>You have problems taking any of your heart medicines.</detail><detail>You have chills or a fever over 101°F (38.3°C).</detail></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>Drug-eluting stents - discharge; PCI - discharge; Percutaneous coronary intervention - discharge; Balloon angioplasty - discharge; Coronary angioplasty - discharge; Coronary artery angioplasty - discharge; Cardiac angioplasty - discharge; PTCA - discharge; Percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty - discharge; Heart artery dilatation - discharge; Angina angioplasty - discharge; Heart attack angioplasty - discharge; CAD angioplasty - discharge</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 8/2/2016"><text>Updated by: Michael A.

<item><title>Allergy shots</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000405.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>An allergy shot is a medicine that is injected into your body to treat allergy symptoms.</text></h2><h2 title="What are Allergy Shots?"><text>An allergy shot contains a small amount of an allergen. This is a substance that causes an allergic reaction. Examples of allergens include:</text><detail>Mold spores</detail><detail>Dust mites</detail><detail>Animal dander</detail><detail>Pollen</detail><detail>Insect venom </detail><text>A health care provider gives you the shots for 3 to 5 years. This series of allergy shots may help reduce your allergy symptoms.</text><text>Work with your provider to identify which allergens are causing your symptoms. This is often done through allergy skin testing or blood tests. Only the allergens you are allergic to are in your allergy shots.</text><text>Allergy shots are only one part of an allergy treatment plan. You may also take allergy medicines while having allergy shots. Your provider may recommend that you reduce your exposure to allergens, as well.</text></h2><h2 title="How do Allergy Shots Work? "><text>Allergy symptoms occur when your immune system tries to attack an allergen in your body. When this happens, your body creates mucus. This can cause bothersome symptoms in the nose, eyes, and lungs.</text><text>Treatment with allergy shots is also called immunotherapy. When a small amount of an allergen is injected into your body, your immune system makes a substance called an antibody that blocks the allergen from causing symptoms.</text><text>After several months of shots, some or all of your symptoms may be relieved. Relief can last several years. For some people, allergy shots can prevent new allergies and reduce asthma symptoms.</text></h2><h2 title="Who can Benefit From Allergy Shots?"><text>You may benefit from allergy shots if you have:</text><detail>Asthma that allergies make worse</detail><detail>Allergic rhinitis, allergic conjunctivitis</detail><detail>Insect bite sensitivity</detail><detail>Eczema, a skin condition that a dust mite allergy can make worse </detail><text>Allergy shots are effective for common allergens such as:</text><detail>Weed and tree pollen</detail><detail>Grass</detail><detail>Mold or fungus</detail><detail>Animal dander</detail><detail>Dust mites</detail><detail>Insect stings </detail><text>Adults (including the older people) as well as children 5 years and older can receive allergy shots.</text><text>Your provider is not likely to recommend allergy shots for you if you:</text><detail>Have severe asthma.</detail><detail>Have a heart condition.</detail><detail>Take certain medicines, such as ACE inhibitors or beta-blockers.</detail><detail>Are pregnant. Pregnant women should not begin allergy shots. But, they may be able to continue allergy shot treatment that was started before they became pregnant. </detail><text>Food allergies are not treated with allergy shots.</text></h2><h2 title="Getting Your Allergy Shots"><text>You will get your allergy shots at your provider's office. They are usually given in the upper arm. The typical schedule is:</text><detail>For the first 3 to 6 months, you receive shots about 1 to 3 times a week.</detail><detail>For the next 3 to 5 years, you receive the shots less often, about every 4 to 6 weeks. </detail><text>Keep in mind that many visits are needed to get the full effects of this treatment. Your provider will assess your symptoms now and then to help decide when you can stop receiving the shots.</text></h2><h2 title="Side Effects"><text>An allergy shot may cause a reaction on the skin, such as redness, swelling, and itching.

This can occur because of age, medicine use, or certain health conditions.</text><text>Saliva plays an important role in maintaining oral health. It protects your teeth from decay and helps your gums stay healthy. When the salivary glands in your mouth don't produce enough saliva, it can increase the risk for:</text><detail>Problems tasting, chewing, and swallowing</detail><detail>Mouth sores</detail><detail>Gum disease and tooth decay</detail><detail>Yeast infection in the mouth (thrush) </detail><text>Your mouth may produce a bit less saliva as you get older. But medical problems that occur in older adults are more common causes of dry mouth:</text><detail>Many medicines, such as those for high blood pressure, high cholesterol, pain, and depression, can reduce the amount of saliva you produce. This is probably the biggest cause of dry mouth in older adults.</detail><detail>Side effects from cancer treatment can cause dry mouth.</detail><detail>Health conditions such as diabetes, stroke, and Sjögren syndrome can affect your ability to produce saliva. </detail><text>GUM PROBLEMS</text><text>Receding gums are common in older adults. This is when the gum tissue pulls away from the tooth, exposing the base, or root, of the tooth. This makes it easy for bacteria to build up and cause inflammation and decay.</text><text>A lifetime of brushing too hard can cause gums to recede. However, gum disease (periodontal disease) is the most common cause of receding gums. </text><text>Gingivitis is an early type of gum disease. It occurs due when plaque and tartar build up and irritate and inflame the gums. Severe gum disease is called periodontitis. It can lead to loss of teeth.</text><text>Certain conditions and diseases common in older adults can put them at risk for periodontal disease.</text><detail>Not brushing and flossing every day</detail><detail>Not getting regular dental care</detail><detail>Smoking</detail><detail>Diabetes</detail><detail>Dry mouth</detail><detail>Weak immune system </detail><text>CAVITIES </text><text>Dental cavities occur when bacteria in the mouth (plaque) changes sugars and starches from food into acid. This acid attacks tooth enamel and can lead to cavities.</text><text>Cavities are common in older adults in part because more adults are keeping their teeth for their lifetime. Because older adults often have receding gums, cavities are more likely to develop at the root of the tooth. </text><text>Dry mouth also causes bacteria to build up in the mouth more easily, leading to tooth decay.</text><text>ORAL CANCER</text><text>Oral cancer is more common in men older than age 40. </text><text>Smoking and other types of tobacco use are the most common cause of oral cancer. Drinking alcohol in excess along with tobacco use greatly increases the risk for oral cancer.</text><text>Other factors that may increase the risk for oral cancer include:</text><detail>Poor dental and oral hygiene</detail><detail>Taking medicines that weaken the immune system (immunosuppressants)</detail><detail>Rubbing from rough teeth, dentures, or fillings over a long period of time</detail><detail>Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection (same virus that causes genital warts and several other cancers) </detail></h2><h2 title="How to Protect Your Teeth and Gum"><text>No matter what your age, proper dental care can keep your teeth and gums healthy.</text><detail>Brush twice a day with a soft-bristle toothbrush and fluoride toothpaste.</detail><detail>Floss at least once a day.</detail><detail>See your dentist for regular check-ups.</detail><detail> Avoid sweets and sugar-sweetened beverages.</detail><detail>Don’t smoke.</detail><text>If medicines are causing dry mouth, talk with your health care provider to see if you may be able to change medicines. Ask about artificial saliva or other products to help keep your mouth moist.</text></h2><h2 title="When to Call the Doctor"><text>You should contact your dentist if you notice:</text><detail>Tooth pain </detail><detail>Red or swollen gums</detail><detail>Dry mouth</detail><detail>Mouth sores</detail><detail>White or red patches in mouth</detail><detail>Bad breath</detail><detail>Loose teeth</detail><detail>Poorly-fitting dentures&lt;br&gt;</detail></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>Dental hygiene - aging; Teeth - aging; Oral hygiene - aging</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 5/12/2018"><text>Updated by: Laura J.

<item><title>After vaginal delivery - in the hospital</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000629.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>Most women will remain in the hospital for 24 hours after delivery. This is important time for you to rest, bond with your new baby and to get help with breastfeeding and newborn care.</text></h2><h2 title="What to Expect after Delivery"><text>Right after delivery, your baby will likely be placed on your chest while a nurse evaluates your baby's transition. Transition is the period after birth when your baby's body is adjusting to being outside your womb. Some babies may need oxygen or extra nursing care to transition. A small number may need to be transferred to the neonatal intensive care unit for extra care. However, most new babies stay in the room with their mother.</text><text>In the first hours after delivery, hold your baby and attempt skin-to-skin contact. This helps ensure optimal bonding and the smoothest possible transition. If you are planning to breastfeed, which is highly recommended, your baby will likely try to latch on.</text><text>During this time, you will stay in the room where you had your baby. A nurse will:</text><detail>Monitor your blood pressure, heart rate, and the amount of vaginal bleeding</detail><detail>Check to make sure your uterus is becoming firmer</detail></h2><h2 title="Contractions, Bleeding, and Pain"><text>Once you deliver, the heavy contractions are over. But your uterus still needs to contract to shrink back to its normal size and prevent heavy bleeding. Breastfeeding also helps the uterus contract. These contractions may be somewhat painful but they are important.</text><text>As your uterus becomes firmer and smaller, you are less likely to have heavier bleeding. Blood flow should gradually decrease during your first day. You may notice a few smaller clots passing when your nurse presses on your uterus to check it.</text><text>For some women, the bleeding does not slow down and may even become heavier. This may be caused by a small piece of placenta that remains in the lining of your uterus. Rarely a minor surgery is needed to remove it. </text></h2><h2 title="Care of the Vagina and Perineum"><text>The area between your vagina and rectum is called the perineum. Even if you did not have a tear or an episiotomy, the area may be swollen and somewhat tender.</text><text>To relieve pain or discomfort:</text><detail>Ask your nurses to apply ice packs right after you give birth. Using ice packs in the first 24 hours after birth decreases the swelling and helps with the pain.</detail><detail>Take warm baths, but wait until 24 hours after you have given birth. Also, use clean linens and towels and make sure the bathtub is clean each time you use it.</detail><detail>Take medicine like ibuprofen to relieve pain.</detail><text>Some women are worried about bowel movements after delivery. You may receive stool softeners.</text><text>Passing urine may hurt during the first day. Most often this discomfort goes away in a day or so.</text></h2><h2 title="Caring for Your Baby"><text>Holding and caring for your new infant is exciting. Most women feel that it makes up for the long journey of pregnancy and the pain and discomfort of labor. Nurses and breastfeeding specialists are available to answer questions and help you.</text><text>Keeping your baby in the room with you helps you to bond with your new family member. If the baby must go to the nursery for health reasons, use this time and rest as much as you can. Taking care of a newborn is a full-time job and can be tiring.</text><text>Some women feel sadness or an emotional letdown after delivery. These feelings are common and are nothing to feel ashamed about. Talk with your health care provider, nurses, and partner.</text></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>After vaginal birth; Pregnancy - after vaginal delivery; Postpartum care - after vaginal delivery</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 11/11/2016"><text>Updated by: Irina Burd, MD, PhD, Associate Professor of Gynecology and Obstetrics at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD.

<item><title>After a C-section - in the hospital</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000620.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>Most women will remain in the hospital for 2 to 3 days after a cesarean birth (C-section). Take advantage of the time to bond with your new baby, get some rest, and receive some help with breastfeeding and caring for your baby.</text></h2><h2 title="What to Expect after a C-section"><text>Right after surgery you may feel:</text><detail>Groggy from any medicines you received</detail><detail>Nausea for the first day or so</detail><detail>Itchy, if you received narcotics in your epidural</detail><text>You will be brought to a recovery area right after surgery, where a nurse will:</text><detail>Monitor your blood pressure, heart rate, and the amount of your vaginal bleeding</detail><detail>Check to make sure your uterus is becoming firmer</detail><detail>Bring you to a hospital room once you are stable, where you will spend the next few days</detail><text>After the excitement of finally delivering and holding your baby, you may notice just how tired you are.</text><text>Your belly will be painful at first, but it will improve a lot over 1 to 2 days.</text><text>Some women feel sadness or an emotional letdown after delivery. These feelings are not uncommon. DO NOT feel ashamed. Talk with your health care providers and partner.</text></h2><h2 title="Seeing and Caring for Your Baby"><text>Breastfeeding can often begin right after surgery. The nurses can help you find the right position. Numbness from your anesthetic can limit your movement for a while, and pain in your cut (incision) can make it a little harder to become comfortable, but do not give up. The nurses can show you how to hold your baby so there is no pressure on your cut (incision) or abdomen.</text><text>Holding and caring for your new infant is exciting, making up for the long journey of your pregnancy and the pain and discomfort of labor. Nurses and breastfeeding specialists are available to answer questions and help you.</text><text>Also take advantage of the babysitting and room service the hospital provides for you. You are going home to both the joys of being a mother and the demands of caring for a newborn infant.</text></h2><h2 title="Activity"><text>Between feeling exhausted after labor and managing the pain from the surgery, getting out of bed may seem like too big of a task.</text><text>But getting out of bed at least once or twice a day at first can help speed your recovery. It also decreases your chance of having blood clots and helps your bowels move.</text><text>Make sure someone is around to help you in case you get dizzy or weak. Plan on taking your walks soon after you have received some pain medicine. </text></h2><h2 title="Contractions and Bleeding"><text>Once you deliver, the heavy contractions are over. But your uterus still needs to contract to shrink back to its normal size and prevent heavy bleeding. Breastfeeding also helps your uterus contract. These contractions may be somewhat painful, but they are important.</text><text>As your uterus becomes firmer and smaller, you are less likely to have heavy bleeding. Blood flow should gradually become slower during your first day. You may notice a few smaller clots passing when the nurse presses on your uterus to check it. </text></h2><h2 title="Pain Relief"><text>Your epidural, or spinal, catheter can also be used for pain relief after surgery. It may be left in for up to 24 hours after delivery.</text><text>If you did not have an epidural, you may receive pain medicines directly into your veins through an intravenous line (IV) after surgery.</text><detail>This line runs through a pump that will be set to give you a certain amount of pain medicine.</detail><detail>Often, you can push a button to give yourself more pain relief when you need it.</detail><detail>This is called patient controlled analgesia (PCA).</detail><text>You will then be switched to pain pills that you take by mouth, or you may receive shots of medicine. It is OK to ask for pain medicine when you need it.</text></h2><h2 title="What Else?"><text>You will have a urinary (Foley) catheter in place right after surgery, but this will be removed on the first day after surgery.</text><text>The area around your cut (incision) may be sore, numb, or both. Sutures or staples are often removed around the second day, just before you leave the hospital.</text><text>At first you may be asked to only eat ice chips or take sips of water, at least until your provider is certain you are not likely to have very heavy bleeding. Most likely, you will be able to eat a light diet 8 hours after your C-section.</text></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>Cesarean section - in the hospital; Postpartum - cesarean</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 11/11/2016"><text>Updated by: Irina Burd, MD, PhD, Associate Professor of Gynecology and Obstetrics at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD.

Keep a second card with your important papers. You can find out about organ donation from your provider.

<item><title>Acne - self-care</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000750.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>Acne is a skin condition that causes pimples or "zits." Whiteheads (closed comedomes), blackheads (open comdedomes), red, inflamed papules, and nodules or cysts may develop. These most often occur on the face or shoulders.</text><text>Acne occurs when tiny pores on the surface of the skin become clogged. The pores can become plugged by substances on the surface of the skin. More commonly they develop from a mixture of the natural oils of the skin and the dead cells shed from the inside of the pore. These plugs are called comedones. Acne is most common in teenagers. But anyone can get acne.</text><text>Acne breakouts can be triggered by:</text><detail>Hormonal changes</detail><detail>Use of oily skin or hair care products</detail><detail>Certain medicines</detail><detail>Sweat</detail><detail>Humidity</detail><detail>Possibly diet</detail></h2><h2 title="Daily Skin Care"><text>To keep your pores from clogging and your skin from becoming too oily:</text><detail>Clean your skin gently with a mild, non-drying soap, such as Dove, Neutrogena, Cetaphil, or CeraVe.</detail><detail>It may help to use a wash with salicylic acid or benzoyl if your skin is oily and prone to acne. Remove all dirt or make up.</detail><detail>Wash once or twice a day, and also after exercising. Avoid scrubbing or repeated skin washing.</detail><detail>Shampoo your hair daily, if it is oily.</detail><detail>Comb or pull your hair back to keep the hair out of your face.</detail><detail>Avoid using rubbing alcohol or toners that are very drying to the skin.</detail><detail>Avoid oil-based cosmetics. </detail><text>Acne medicines can cause skin drying or peeling. Use a moisturizer or skin cream that is water-based or "noncomedogenic" or that clearly states that is safe to use on the face and will not cause acne. Remember that products that say they are noncomedogenic might still cause acne in you personally. Therefore, avoid any product that you find makes your acne worse.</text><text>A small amount of sun exposure may improve acne slightly. But, tanning mostly just hides it. Too much exposure to sun or in tanning booths increases the risk for skin cancer. Some acne medicines can make your skin more sensitive to the sun. Use sunscreen and hats regularly if you are taking these medicines.</text><text>There is no consistent evidence that you need to avoid chocolate, milk, high-fat foods, or sweetened foods. However, it is a good idea to avoid any of foods if you find eating those specific foods seems to make your acne worse.</text><text>To further prevent acne:</text><detail>DO NOT aggressively squeeze, scratch, pick, or rub pimples. This can lead to skin infections as well as scarring and delayed healing.</detail><detail>Avoid wearing tight headbands, baseball caps, and other hats.</detail><detail>Avoid touching your face.</detail><detail>Avoid greasy cosmetics or creams.</detail><detail>DO NOT leave make up on overnight. </detail></h2><h2 title="Acne Medicines"><text>If daily skin care does not clear up blemishes, try over-the-counter acne medicines that you apply to your skin.</text><detail>These products may contain benzoyl peroxide, sulfur, adapalene, resorcinol, or salicylic acid.</detail><detail>They work by killing bacteria, drying up skin oils, or causing the top layer of your skin to peel.</detail><detail>They may cause redness or peeling of the skin.</detail><text>If these acne medicines cause your skin to become irritated:</text><detail>Try using smaller amounts. A drop the size of a pea will cover the entire face.</detail><detail>Use the medicines only every other or third day until your skin gets used to them.</detail><detail>Wait 10 to 15 minutes after washing your face before applying these medicines.</detail></h2><h2 title="Treatments From Your Health Care Provider"><text>If pimples are still a problem after you've tried over-the-counter medicines, your health care provider may suggest:</text><detail>Antibiotics in the form of pills or creams that you put on your skin</detail><detail>Prescription gels or creams containing a retinoid to help clear up the pimples</detail><detail>Hormone pills for women whose acne is made worse by hormonal changes</detail><detail>Isotretinoin pills for severe acne</detail><detail>A laser procedure called photodynamic therapy</detail><detail>Chemical skin peeling </detail></h2><h2 title="When to Call the Doctor"><text>Call your provider or a dermatologist if:</text><detail>Self-care steps and over-the-counter medicine do not help after several months.</detail><detail>Your acne is very bad (for example, you have a lot of redness around the pimples, or you have cysts).</detail><detail>Your acne is getting worse.</detail><detail>You develop scars as your acne clears up.</detail><detail>Acne is causing emotional stress. </detail></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>Acne vulgaris - self-care; Cystic acne - self-care; Pimples - self-care; Zits - self-care</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 2/27/2018"><text>Updated by: David L.

This article tells you how to care for yourself when you go home from the hospital.</text></h2><h2 title="When You're in the Hospital"><text>You had surgery to reconstruct your anterior cruciate ligament (ACL). The surgeon drilled holes in the bones of your knee and placed a new ligament through these holes. The new ligament was then attached to the bone. You may also have had surgery to repair other tissue in your knee.</text></h2><h2 title="What to Expect at Home"><text>You may need help taking care of yourself when you first go home. Plan for a spouse, friend, or neighbor to help you. It can take from a few days to a few months to ready to return to work. How soon you return to work will depend on the kind of work you do. It often takes 4 to 6 months to return to your full level of activity and take part in sports again after surgery.</text></h2><h2 title="Activity"><text>Your health care provider will ask you to rest when you first go home. You will be told to:</text><detail>Keep your leg propped up on 1 or 2 pillows. Place the pillows under your foot or calf muscle. This helps keep swelling down. Do this 4 to 6 times a day for the first 2 or 3 days after surgery. DO NOT put the pillow behind your knee. Keep your knee straight.</detail><detail>Be careful not to get the dressing on your knee wet.</detail><detail>DO NOT use a heating pad. </detail><text>You may need to wear special support stockings to help prevent blood clots from forming. Your provider will also give you exercises to keep the blood moving in your foot, ankle, and leg. These exercises will also lower your risk of blood clots.</text><text>You will need to use crutches when you go home. You may be able to begin putting your full weight on your repaired leg without crutches 2 to 3 weeks after surgery. If you had work on your knee in addition to ACL reconstruction, it may take 4 to 8 weeks to regain full use of your knee. Ask your surgeon how long you will need to be on crutches.</text><text>You may also need to wear a special knee brace. The brace will be set so that your knee can move only a certain amount in any direction. DO NOT change the settings on the brace yourself.</text><detail>Ask your provider or physical therapist about sleeping without the brace and removing it for showers.</detail><detail>When the brace is off for any reason, be careful not to move your knee more than you can when you have the brace on. </detail><text>You will need to learn how to go up and down stairs using crutches or with a knee brace on.</text><text>Physical therapy most often begins about 1 to 2 weeks after surgery, however you can do some simple postoperative knee exercises immediately after surgery. The duration of physical therapy may last 2 to 6 months. You will need to limit your activity and movement while your knee mends. Your physical therapist will give you an exercise program to help you build strength in your knee and avoid injury.</text><detail>Staying active and building strength in the muscles of your legs will help speed your recovery.</detail><detail>Getting full range of motion in your leg soon after surgery is also important. </detail></h2><h2 title="Wound Care"><text>You will go home with a dressing and an ace bandage around your knee. DO NOT remove them until the provider says it is ok. Until then, keep the dressing and bandage clean and dry.</text><text>You can shower again after your dressing is removed.</text><detail>When you shower, wrap your leg in plastic to keep it from getting wet until your stitches or tape (Steri-Strips) have been removed. Make sure that your provider says this is OK.</detail><detail>After that, you may get the incisions wet when you shower. Be sure to dry the area well. </detail><text>If you need to change your dressing for any reason, put the ace bandage back on over the new dressing. Wrap the ace bandage loosely around your knee. Start from the calf and wrap it around your leg and knee. DO NOT wrap it too tightly. Keep wearing the ace bandage until your provider tells you it is ok to remove it.</text></h2><h2 title="Pain"><text>Pain is normal after knee arthroscopy. It should ease up over time.</text><text>Your provider will give you a prescription for pain medicine. Get it filled when you go home so that you have it when you need it. Take your pain medicine when you start having pain so the pain doesn't get too bad. </text><text>You may have received a nerve block during surgery, so that your nerves do not feel pain. Make sure you take your pain medicine, even when the block is working. The block will wear off, and pain can return very quickly.</text><text>Ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) or another medicine like it may also help. Ask your provider what other medicines are safe to take with your pain medicine.</text><text>DO NOT drive if you are taking narcotic pain medicine. This medicine may make you too sleepy to drive safely.</text></h2><h2 title="When to Call the Doctor"><text>Call your provider if:</text><detail>Blood is soaking through your dressing, and the bleeding does not stop when you put pressure on the area.</detail><detail>Pain does not go away after you take pain medicine.</detail><detail>You have swelling or pain in your calf muscle.</detail><detail>Your foot or toes look darker than normal or are cool to the touch.</detail><detail>You have redness, pain, swelling, or yellowish discharge from your incisions.</detail><detail>You have a temperature higher than 101°F (38.3°C). </detail></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction - discharge</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 11/27/2016"><text>Updated by: C.

Before surgery, you will wear a special boot that keeps you from moving your lower leg and foot.</text><text>For a partial tear:</text><detail>You may need surgery.</detail><detail>Instead of surgery, you may need to wear a cast, leg brace, splint, or boot for about 6 weeks. During this time, your tendon grows back together. </detail><text>If you have a cast, it will cover your foot and go to your knee. Your toes will be pointing downward. The cast will be changed every 2 to 3 weeks to help stretch your tendon.</text><text>If you have a leg brace, splint, or boot, it will keep you from moving your foot. This will prevent further injury.

Along with the other common symptoms during pregnancy, you will often notice new aches and pains.</text></h2><h2 title="Headaches"><text>Headaches are common during pregnancy. Before you take medicine, ask your health care provider if it is safe to take. Other than medicine, relaxation techniques may help.</text><text>Headaches can be a sign of preeclampsia (high blood pressure during pregnancy). If your headaches get worse, and they do not go away easily when you rest and take acetaminophen (Tylenol), especially toward the end of your pregnancy, tell your provider. </text></h2><h2 title="Pain in Your Lower Abdomen (Belly) or Groin "><text>Most often, this happens between 18 and 24 weeks. When you feel stretching or pain, move slowly or change positions. </text><text>Mild aches and pains lasting for short periods of time are normal. But see your provider right away if you have constant, severe abdominal pain, possible contractions, or you have pain and are bleeding or have fever. These are symptoms that can indicate more severe problems, such as: </text><detail>Placental abruption (the placenta separates from the uterus)</detail><detail>Preterm labor</detail><detail>Gallbladder disease</detail><detail>Appendicitis </detail></h2><h2 title="Numbness and Tingling"><text>As your uterus grows, it may press on the nerves in your legs. This may cause some numbness and tingling (feeling of pins and needles) in your legs and toes. This is normal and will go away after you give birth (it may take a few weeks to months).</text><text>You may also have numbness or tingling in your fingers and hands. You may notice it more often when you wake up in the morning. This also goes away after you give birth, though, again, not always right away.</text><text>If it is uncomfortable, you can wear a brace at night. Ask your provider where to get one. </text><text>Have your provider check any persistent numbness, tingling, or weakness in any extremity to ensure there is not a more serious problem.</text></h2><h2 title="Backache"><text>Pregnancy strains your back and posture. To avoid or reduce backaches, you can:</text><detail>Stay physically fit, walk, and stretch regularly.</detail><detail>Wear low-heeled shoes.</detail><detail>Sleep on your side with a pillow between your legs.</detail><detail>Sit in a chair with good back support.</detail><detail>Avoid standing for too long.</detail><detail>Bend your knees when picking things up. DO NOT bend at the waist.</detail><detail>Avoid lifting heavy objects.</detail><detail>Avoid gaining too much weight.</detail><detail>Use heat or cold on the sore part of your back.</detail><detail>Have someone massage or rub the sore part of your back. If you go to a professional massage therapist, let them know you are pregnant.</detail><detail>Do back exercises that your provider suggests to relieve back stress and maintain a healthy posture. </detail></h2><h2 title="Leg Aches and Pains"><text>The extra weight you carry when you are pregnant can make your legs and back hurt.</text><text>Your body will also make a hormone that loosens ligaments throughout your body to prepare you for childbirth. However, these looser ligaments are more easily injured, most often in your back, so be careful when you lift and exercise.</text><text>Leg cramps are common in the last months of pregnancy. Sometimes stretching your legs before bed will reduce the cramps. Your provider can show you how to safely stretch.</text><text>Watch for pain and swelling in one leg, but not the other. This can be a sign of a blood clot. Let your provider know if this happens. </text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 10/4/2016"><text>Updated by: John D.

<item><title>A guide to herbal remedies</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000868.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>Herbal remedies are plants used like a medicine. People use herbal remedies to help prevent or cure disease. They use them to get relief from symptoms, boost energy, relax, or lose weight. </text><text>Herbals are not regulated or tested like medicines. </text><text>How can you know what you are getting and if it is useful? This guide can help you choose and use herbals safely.</text></h2><h2 title="Herbals are not Medicines"><text>You have to be careful when using an herbal remedy. Herbal remedies are a type of dietary supplement. They are not medicines. Here are some things you should know about herbals:</text><detail>Herbals are not regulated like medicines.</detail><detail>Herbals do not need to be rigidly tested before they are sold.</detail><detail>Herbals may not work as claimed.</detail><detail>Labels do not need to be approved. It may not list the correct amount of an ingredient.</detail><detail>Some herbal remedies may contain ingredients or contaminants not listed on the label. </detail></h2><h2 title="Natural Does not Mean Safe"><text>Many people think that using plants to treat illness is safer than taking medicine. People have been using plants in folk medicine for centuries. So it is easy to see the appeal. Yet "natural" does not mean safe. Unless taken as directed, some herbals can interact with other medicines or be toxic at high doses. Also, some may cause side effects.</text><text>Here are some examples:</text><detail>Kava is an herb used for anxiety, insomnia, symptoms of menopause, and other ailments. Some studies show it may work for anxiety. But kava can also cause severe liver damage. The FDA has issued a warning against its use.</detail><detail>St. John's Wort may work for mild to moderate depression. However, it can interact with birth control pills, antidepressants, and other drugs. It can also cause side effects such as stomach upset and anxiety.</detail><detail>Yohimbe is a bark used to treat erectile dysfunction. The bark can cause high blood pressure, increased heart rate, anxiety, and other side effects. It can interact with certain medicines for depression. Taking it in high does or for a long time can be dangerous. </detail><text>Of course, some herbals have been tested and work well for their intended purpose. Many are also quite safe, but the word "natural" will not tell you which ones are safe and which ones are not safe.</text></h2><h2 title="How to Choose and Use Herbal Remedies Safely"><text>Some herbals can make you feel better and help keep you healthy. But you need to be a smart consumer. Use these tips when choosing herbal remedies.</text><detail>Look closely at the claims made about the product. How is the product described? Is it a "miracle" pill that "melts away" fat? Will it work faster than regular care? Is it a secret your health care provider and drug companies don't want you to know? Such claims are red flags. If something's too good to be true, it probably is not.</detail><detail>Remember "real-life stories" are not scientific proof. Many products are promoted with real-life stories. Even if the quote comes from a provider, there's no proof that other people will get the same results.</detail><detail>Before trying a product, talk with your provider. Ask for their opinion. Is the product safe? What are the chances it will work? Are their risks? Will it interact with other medicines? Will it interfere with your treatment?</detail><detail>Buy only from companies that have certification on the label, such as "USP Verified" or "ConsumerLab.com Approved Quality." Companies with these certifications agree to test the purity and quality of their products.</detail><detail>DO NOT give herbal supplements to children or use them if you are older than 65. Talk to your provider first.</detail><detail>DO NOT use herbals without talking to your provider if you are taking any medicines.</detail><detail>DO NOT use them if you are pregnant or breastfeeding.</detail><detail>DO NOT use them if you are having surgery.</detail><detail>Always let your provider know what herbals you use. They can affect the medicines you take as well any treatment you receive.</detail></h2><h2 title="Where to Get More Information"><text>These sites can help you learn more about specific herbal supplements:</text><detail>NIH MedlinePlus database of herbs and supplements -- www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/herb_All.html</detail><detail>The National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH) Herbs at a Glance --nccih.nih.gov/health/herbsataglance.htm</detail><detail>American Cancer Society Complementary and Alternative Medicine Page -- www.cancer.org/treatment/treatmentsandsideeffects/complementaryandalternativemedicine/complementary-and-alternative-medicine-landing</detail></h2><h2 title="Review Date 9/3/2016"><text>Updated by: Linda J.

<item><title>A guide to clinical trials for cancer</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000823.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>If you have cancer, a clinical trial may be an option for you. A clinical trial is a study using people who agree to participate in new tests or treatments. Clinical trials help researchers know whether a new treatment works well and is safe. Trials are available for many cancers and all stages of cancer, not just advanced cancer. </text><text>If you join a trial, you may get treatment that can help you. Plus, you will help others to learn more about your cancer as well as new tests or treatments. There are many things to consider before joining a trial. Learn about why you might want to enroll in a clinical trial and where to find one.</text></h2><h2 title="What is a Clinical Trial for Cancer?"><text>Clinical trials for cancer look at ways to:</text><detail>Prevent cancer</detail><detail>Screen or test for cancer</detail><detail>Treat or manage cancer</detail><detail>Reduce symptoms or side effects of cancer or cancer treatments</detail><text>A clinical trial will recruit many people to participate. During the study, each group of people will receive a different test or treatment. Some will get the new treatment being tested. Others will get standard treatment. The researchers will collect the results to see what works best. </text><text>Current cancer medicines, tests, and treatments used by most health care providers have been tested through clinical trials.</text></h2><h2 title="Why Should You Consider a Clinical Trial?"><text>The decision to join a clinical trial is a personal one. It is a decision you have to make based on your values, goals, and expectations. Plus, there are benefits and risks when you join a trial. </text><text>Some of the benefits include:</text><detail>You may receive a new treatment that is not yet available to other people.</detail><detail>You may receive treatment that is better than what is currently available.</detail><detail>You will receive close attention and monitoring by your providers.</detail><detail>You will help researchers understand your cancer and learn better ways to help other people with the same cancer. </detail><text>Some of the potential risks include:</text><detail>You may experience side effects.</detail><detail>The new treatment may not work for you.</detail><detail>The new treatment may not be as good as standard treatment.</detail><detail>You may need more office visits and more tests.</detail><detail>Your insurance may not pay for all of your costs in a clinical trial. </detail></h2><h2 title="Is It Safe?"><text>There are strict federal rules in place to protect your safety during a clinical trial. Safety guidelines (protocols) are agreed to before the study begins. These guidelines are reviewed by health experts to make sure that the study is based on good science and the risks are low. Clinical trials are also monitored during the entire study. </text><text>Before you join a clinical trial, you will learn about the safety guidelines, what is expected of you, and how long the study will last. You will be asked to sign a consent form saying that you understand and agree to the way the study will be run and the potential side effects.</text></h2><h2 title="Is There a Cost?"><text>Before you join a trial, make sure you look into which costs are covered. Routine cancer care costs are often covered by health insurance. You should review your policy and contact your health plan to make sure. Often, your health plan will cover most routine office visits and consults, as well as tests done to monitor your health.</text><text>Research costs, such as the study medicine, or extra visits or tests, may need to be covered by the research sponsor. Also keep in mind that extra visits and tests may mean additional cost to you in lost work time and daycare or transportation costs.</text></h2><h2 title="Who Can Join a Clinical Trial?"><text>Each clinical study has guidelines about who can join. This is called eligibility criteria. These guidelines are based on what questions the researchers are trying to answer. Studies often try to include people who have certain things in common. This can make it easier to understand the results. So you may be able to join only if you have cancer at a certain stage, are older or younger than a certain age, and do not have other health problems. </text><text>If you are eligible, you can apply to be in the clinical trial. Once accepted, you become a volunteer. This means that you may quit at any time. But if you feel you want to quit, be sure you talk it over with your provider first. </text></h2><h2 title="How to Find a Clinical Trial?"><text>Trials are done in many places, such as:</text><detail>Cancer centers</detail><detail>Local hospitals</detail><detail>Medical group offices</detail><detail>Community clinics </detail><text>You can find clinical trials listed on the website of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) -- www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/clinical-trials. It is a part of the National Institutes of Health, the United States government research agency. Many of the clinical trials run across the country are sponsored by the NCI.</text><text>If you are interested in joining a clinical trial, talk with your provider. Ask if there is a trial in your area related to your cancer. Your provider can help you understand the type of care you will receive and how the trial will change or add to your care. You can also go over all of the risks and benefits to decide whether joining a trial is a good move for you.</text></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>Intervention study - cancer</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 7/26/2018"><text>Updated by: Todd Gersten, MD, Hematology/Oncology, Florida Cancer Specialists &amp;amp; Research Institute, Wellington, FL.

<item><title>Kneecap dislocation - aftercare</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000585.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>Your kneecap (patella) sits over the front of your knee joint. As you bend or straighten your knee, the underside of your kneecap glides over a groove in the bones that make up your knee joint.</text><detail>A kneecap that slides out of the groove partway is called a subluxation.</detail><detail>A kneecap that moves fully outside the groove is called a dislocation. </detail></h2><h2 title="More About Your Injury"><text>A kneecap can be knocked out of the groove when the knee is hit from the side.</text><text>A kneecap can also slide out of the groove during normal movement or when there is twisting motion or a sudden turn.</text><text>Kneecap subluxation or dislocation may occur more than once. The first few times it happens will be painful, and you will be unable to walk.</text><text>If subluxations continue to occur and are not treated, you may feel less pain when they happen. However, there may be more damage to your knee joint each time it happens. </text></h2><h2 title="What to Expect"><text>You may have had a knee x-ray or an MRI to make sure your kneecap bone did not break and there was no damage to the cartilage or tendons (other tissues in your knee joint).</text><text>If tests show that you do not have damage:</text><detail>Your knee may be placed in a brace, splint, or cast for several weeks.</detail><detail>You may need to use crutches at first so that you do not put too much weight on your knee.</detail><detail>You will need to follow up with your primary care provider or a bone doctor (orthopedist).</detail><detail>You may need physical therapy to work on strengthening and conditioning.</detail><detail>Most people recover fully within 6 to 8 weeks. </detail><text>If your kneecap is damaged or unstable, you may need surgery to repair or stabilize it. Your health care provider will most often refer you to an orthopaedic surgeon. </text></h2><h2 title="Symptom Relief"><text>Sit with your knee raised at least 4 times a day. This will help reduce swelling.</text><text>Ice your knee. Make an ice pack by putting ice cubes in a plastic bag and wrapping a cloth around it.</text><detail>For the first day of injury, apply the ice pack every hour for 10 to 15 minutes.</detail><detail>After the first day, ice the area every 3 to 4 hours for 2 or 3 days or until the pain goes away. </detail><text>Pain medicines such as acetaminophen, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin, and others), or naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn, and others) may help ease pain and swelling.</text><detail>Be sure to take these only as directed. Carefully read the warnings on the label before you take them.</detail><detail>Talk with your provider before using these medicines if you have heart disease, high blood pressure, kidney disease, liver disease, or have had stomach ulcers or internal bleeding in the past. </detail></h2><h2 title="Activity"><text>You will need to change your activity while you are wearing a splint or brace. Your provider will advise you about:</text><detail>How much weight you can place on your knee</detail><detail>When you can remove the splint or brace</detail><detail>Bicycling instead of running while you heal, if your usual activity is running </detail><text>Many exercises can help stretch and strengthen the muscles around your knee, thigh, and hip. Your provider may show these to you or may have you work with a physical therapist to learn them.</text><text>Before returning to sports or strenuous activity, your injured leg should be as strong as your uninjured leg. You should also be able to:</text><detail>Run and jump on your injured leg without pain</detail><detail>Fully straighten and bend your injured knee without pain</detail><detail>Jog and sprint straight ahead without limping or feeling pain</detail><detail>Be able to do 45- and 90-degree cuts when running </detail></h2><h2 title="When to Call the Doctor"><text>Call your provider if:</text><detail>Your knee feels unstable.</detail><detail>Pain or swelling returns after having gone away.</detail><detail>Your injury does not seem to be getting better with time.</detail><detail>You have pain when your knee catches and locks. </detail></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>

This article tells you how to care for your new knee when you go home from the hospital.</text></h2><h2 title="When You're in the Hospital"><text>You had knee replacement surgery to replace all or part of the bones that make up your knee joint. Your surgeon removed and reshaped your damaged bones, then put your new artificial knee joint in place. You should have received pain medicine and learned how to take care your new knee joint.</text></h2><h2 title="What to Expect at Home"><text>By the time you go home, you should be able to walk with a walker or crutches without needing much help. You may need to use these walking aids for up to 3 months. You should also be able to dress yourself with only a little help and get into and out of your bed or a chair by yourself. You should also be able to use the toilet without much help.</text><text>Over time, you should be able to return to your former level of activity. You will need to avoid some sports, such as downhill skiing or contact sports like football and soccer. But, you should be able to do low impact activities, such as hiking, gardening, swimming, playing tennis, and golfing.</text><text>A physical therapist may visit you at home to make sure your home is set up safely for you as you recover.</text></h2><h2 title="Home Setup "><text>Your bed should be low enough for your feet to touch the floor when you sit on the edge of the bed. Keep tripping hazards out of your home.</text><detail>Learn how to prevent falls. Remove loose wires or cords from areas you walk through to get from one room to another. Remove loose throw rugs. DO NOT keep small pets in your home. Fix any uneven flooring in doorways. Use good lighting.</detail><detail>Make your bathroom safe. Put hand rails in the bathtub or shower and next to the toilet. Place a slip-proof mat in the bathtub or shower.</detail><detail>DO NOT carry anything when you are walking around. You may need your hands to help you balance. </detail><text>Put things where they are easy to reach. </text><text>Set up your home so that you do not have to climb steps. Some tips are:</text><detail>Set up a bed or use bedroom on the same floor.</detail><detail>Have a bathroom or a portable commode on the same floor where you spend most of your day. </detail><text>You may need help with bathing, using the toilet, cooking, running errands and shopping, going to your medical appointments, and exercising. If you do not have a caregiver to help you at home for the first 1 or 2 weeks, ask your health care provider about having a trained caregiver come to your home.</text></h2><h2 title="Activity"><text>Use your walker or crutches as your provider told you to use them. Take short walks often. Wear shoes that fit well and have nonskid soles. DO NOT wear high heels or slippers while you are recovering from surgery.</text><text>Do the exercises your physical therapist taught you. Your provider and physical therapist will help you decide when you no longer need crutches, a cane, or a walker.</text><text>Ask your provider or physical therapist about using a stationary bicycle and swimming as extra exercises to build your muscles and bones.</text><text>Try not to sit for more than 45 minutes at a time. Get up and move around after 45 minutes if you will be sitting some more.</text></h2><h2 title="Precautions"><text>To prevent injury to your new knee:</text><detail>DO NOT twist or pivot your body when you are using a walker.</detail><detail>DO NOT climb up on a ladder or stepstool.</detail><detail>DO NOT kneel down to pick up anything.</detail><detail>When lying in bed, keep a pillow under your heel or ankle, NOT your knee. It is important to keep your knee straight. Try to stay in positions that do not bend your knee. </detail><text>Your provider or physical therapist will tell you when you can start putting weight on your leg and how much weight is OK. When you can start bearing weight will depend on what kind of knee joint you have. It is important not to start bearing weight until your doctor tells you it is safe to.</text><text>DO NOT carry anything over 5 to 10 pounds (2.25 to 4.5 kilograms).</text><text>Ice your knee 30 minutes before and 30 minutes after activity or exercises. Icing will decrease swelling.</text></h2><h2 title="Wound Care"><text>Keep the dressing (bandage) on your incision clean and dry. Change the dressing only if your surgeon told you to. If you do change it, follow these steps:</text><detail>Wash your hands well with soap and water.</detail><detail>Remove the dressing carefully. DO NOT pull hard. If you need to, soak some of the dressing with sterile water or saline to help loosen it.</detail><detail>Soak some clean gauze with saline and wipe from one end of the incision to the other. DO NOT wipe back and forth over the same area.</detail><detail>Dry the incision the same way with clean, dry gauze. Wipe or pat in just 1 direction.</detail><detail>Check your wound for signs of infection. These include severe swelling and redness and drainage that has a bad odor.</detail><detail>Apply a new dressing the way your doctor or nurse showed you. </detail><text>Sutures (stitches) or staples will be removed about 10 to 14 days after surgery. You may shower 3 to 4 days after surgery, as long as your surgeon says you can. When you can shower, let the water run over the incision but do not scrub your incision or let the water beat down on it. DO NOT soak in a bathtub, hot tub, or swimming pool.</text><text>You may have bruising around your wound. This is normal, and it will go away on its own. The skin around your incision may be a little red. This is normal too.</text></h2><h2 title="Self-care"><text>Your provider will give you a prescription for pain medicines. Get it filled when you go home so you have it when you need it. Take your pain medicine when you start having pain. Waiting too long to take it will allow your pain to get more severe than it should.</text><text>In the early part of your recovery, taking pain medicine about 30 minutes before you increase your activity can help control pain.</text><text>You may be asked to wear special compression stockings on your legs for about 6 weeks. These will help prevent blood clots from forming. You may also need to take blood thinners for 2 to 4 weeks to lower your risk of blood clots.</text><text>Take all your medicines the way you have been told.</text><detail>DO NOT double up on your pain medicine if you miss a dose.</detail><detail>If you are taking blood thinners, ask your doctor whether you can also take ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) or other anti-inflammatory drugs. </detail><text>You may need to avoid sexual activity for a while. Your provider will tell you when it is OK to start again.</text><text>People who have a prosthesis, such as an artificial joint, need to carefully protect themselves against infection. You should carry a medical identification card in your wallet that says you have a prosthesis. You may need to take antibiotics before any dental work or invasive medical procedures. Make sure to check with your provider, and tell your dentist about your knee replacement and that you need antibiotics before any dental work.</text></h2><h2 title="When to Call the Doctor"><text>Call your provider if you have:</text><detail>Blood is soaking through your dressing and the bleeding does not stop when you put pressure on the area</detail><detail>Pain that does not go away after you take your pain medicine</detail><detail>Swelling or pain in your calf muscle</detail><detail>Your foot or toes look darker than normal or are cool to touch</detail><detail>Yellowish discharge from your incision</detail><detail>A temperature higher than 101°F (38.3°C)</detail><detail>Swelling around your incision</detail><detail>Redness around your incision</detail><detail>Chest pain</detail><detail>Chest congestion</detail><detail>Breathing problems or shortness of breath </detail></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>Total knee replacement - discharge; Knee arthroplasty - discharge; Knee replacement - total - discharge; Tricompartmental knee replacement - discharge; Osteoarthritis - knee replacement discharge</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 11/27/2016"><text>Updated by: C.

Over time, your whole knee becomes stiffer and stiffer. </detail></h2><h2 title="Unloading Braces for Knee Arthritis"><text>In some people, arthritis may affect mostly the inside of the knee. This may be because the inside of the knee often bears more of a person's weight than the outside of the knee.</text><text>A special brace called an "unloading brace" may help take some of the pressure off the worn part of your knee when you are standing. </text><text>An unloading brace does not cure your arthritis. But it may help relieve symptoms such as knee pain or buckling when you move around. People who want to delay having knee replacement surgery may want to try using unloading braces.</text><text>There are two types of unloading braces:</text><detail>An orthotist can make a custom fitted unloading brace. You will need a prescription from your doctor. These braces often cost over $1,000 and insurance may not pay for them.</detail><detail>Unloading braces may be bought in different sizes at a medical device store without a prescription. These braces cost a few hundred dollars. However, they may not fit as well and be as effective as custom braces. </detail><text>It is not clear how well unloading braces work. Some people say they have fewer symptoms when they use them. Some medical studies have tested these braces. But this research has not proven whether or not unloading braces provide help for people with knee arthritis.</text></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>Unloading brace</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 9/7/2017"><text>Updated by: C.

<item><title>Knee arthroscopy - discharge </title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000199.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>You had surgery to treat problems in your knee. This article discusses how to take care of yourself when you go home from the hospital.</text></h2><h2 title="When You're in the Hospital"><text>You had surgery to treat problems in your knee (knee arthroscopy). You may have been checked for:</text><detail>Torn meniscus. Meniscus is cartilage that cushions the space between the bones in the knee. Surgery is done to repair or remove it.</detail><detail>Torn or damaged anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) or posterior cruciate ligament (PCL).</detail><detail>Inflamed or damaged lining of the joint. This lining is called the synovium.</detail><detail>Misalignment of the kneecap (patella). Misalignment puts the kneecap out of position.</detail><detail>Small pieces of broken cartilage in the knee joint.</detail><detail>Baker's cyst. This is a swelling behind the knee that is filled with fluid. Sometimes this occurs when there is inflammation (soreness and pain) from other causes, like arthritis. The cyst can be removed during this surgery.</detail><detail>Some fractures of the bones of the knee.</detail></h2><h2 title="What to Expect at Home"><text>You may be able to put weight on your knee in the first week after having this surgery. Ask your health care provider if there are activities you should limit. Most people can return to their normal activities within the first month. You may need to be on crutches for a while depending on your procedure.</text><text>If you have a more complicated knee arthroscopy procedure, you may not be able to walk for several weeks. You may also need to use crutches or a knee brace. Full recovery may take several months to a year.</text></h2><h2 title="Pain"><text>Pain is normal after knee arthroscopy. It should get better over time.</text><text>You will get a prescription for pain medicine. Get it filled when you go home so that you have it when you need it. Take your pain medicine as soon as pain starts. This will prevent it from getting too bad. </text><text>You may have received a nerve block, so you don't feel pain during and after surgery. Make sure you take your pain medicine. The nerve block will wear off, and pain can return very quickly.</text><text>Taking ibuprofen or another anti-inflammatory medicine may also help. Ask your provider what other medicines are safe to take with your pain medicine.</text><text>DO NOT drive if you are taking narcotic pain medicine. This medicine may make you too sleepy to drive safely.</text></h2><h2 title="Activity"><text>Your provider will ask you to rest when you first go home. Keep your leg propped up on 1 or 2 pillows. Place the pillows under your foot or calf muscle. This helps control swelling in your knee.</text><text>For most procedures, you may start to put weight on your leg soon after surgery, unless your provider tells you not to. You should:</text><detail>Start slowly by walking around the house. You may need to use crutches at first to help you keep from putting too much weight on your knee.</detail><detail>Try not to stand for long periods.</detail><detail>Do any exercises your provider taught you.</detail><detail>DO NOT jog, swim, do aerobics, or ride a bicycle until your doctor tells you it is ok. </detail><text>Ask your provider when you can return to work or drive again.</text></h2><h2 title="Wound Care"><text>You will have a dressing and an ace bandage around your knee when you go home. DO NOT remove these until your provider says it is OK. Keep the dressing and bandage clean and dry.</text><text>Place an ice pack on your knee 4 to 6 times a day for the first 2 or 3 days. Be careful not to get the dressing wet. DO NOT use a heating pad.</text><text>Keep the ace bandage on until your provider tells you it is OK to remove it.</text><detail>If you need to change your dressing for any reason, put the ace bandage back on over the new dressing.</detail><detail>Wrap the ace bandage loosely around your knee. Start from the calf and wrap it around your leg and knee.</detail><detail>DO NOT wrap it too tightly. </detail><text>When you shower, wrap your leg in plastic to keep it from getting wet until your stitches or tape have been removed. Please check with your surgeon to see whether that is OK. After that, you may get the incisions wet when you shower. Be sure to dry the area well.</text></h2><h2 title="When to Call the Doctor"><text>Call your provider if:</text><detail>Blood is soaking through your dressing, and the bleeding does not stop when you put pressure on the area.</detail><detail>Pain does not go away after you take pain medicine or is getting worse with time.</detail><detail>You have swelling or pain in your calf muscle.</detail><detail>Your foot or toes look darker than normal or are cool to the touch.</detail><detail>You have redness, pain, swelling, or yellowish discharge from your incisions.</detail><detail>You have a temperature higher than 101°F (38.3°C). </detail></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>Knee scope - arthroscopic lateral retinacular release - discharge; Synovectomy - discharge; Patellar debridement - discharge; Meniscus repair - discharge; Lateral release - discharge; Collateral ligament repair - discharge; Knee surgery - discharge</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 11/27/2016"><text>Updated by: C.

You had a medical procedure called lithotripsy to break up the kidney stones. This article gives you advice on what to expect and how to take care of yourself after the procedure.</text></h2><h2 title="When You're in the Hospital "><text>You had lithotripsy, a medical procedure that uses high frequency sound (shock) waves to break up stones in your kidney, bladder, or ureter (the tube that carries urine from your kidneys to your bladder). The waves break the stones into tiny pieces.</text></h2><h2 title="What to Expect at Home "><text>It is normal to have a small amount of blood in your urine for a few days to a few weeks after this procedure.</text><text>You may have pain and nausea when the stone pieces pass. This can happen soon after treatment and may last for 4 to 8 weeks.</text><text>You may have some bruising on your back or side where the stone was treated. You may also have some pain over the treatment area.</text></h2><h2 title="Self-care "><text>Have someone drive you home from the hospital. Rest when you get home. Most people can go back to their regular daily activities 1 or 2 days after this procedure.</text><text>Drink a lot of water in the weeks after treatment. This helps pass any pieces of stone that still remain. Your health care provider may give you a medicine called an alpha blocker to make it easier to pass the pieces of stone.</text><text>Learn how to prevent your kidney stones from coming back.</text><text>Take the pain medicine your provider has told you to take and drink a lot of water if you have pain.

The kidney stone may be stuck in your ureter (the tube that carries urine from your kidneys to your bladder). It also may be stuck in your bladder or urethra (the tube that carries urine from your bladder to outside your body). A stone can block the flow of your urine and cause great pain.

<item><title>Kidney stones - self-care</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000135.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>A kidney stone is a solid mass made up of tiny crystals. Your health care provider may ask you to take self-care steps to treat kidney stones or prevent them from returning.</text></h2><h2 title="What to Expect at Home"><text>You visited your provider or the hospital because you have a kidney stone. You will need to take self-care steps. Which steps you take depend on the type of stone you have, but they may include:</text><detail>Drinking extra water and other liquids</detail><detail>Eating more of some foods and cutting back on other foods</detail><detail>Taking medicines to help prevent stones</detail><detail>Taking medicines to help you pass a stone (anti-inflammatory drugs, alpha-blockers)</detail><text>You may be asked to try to catch your kidney stone. You can do this by collecting all of your urine and straining it. Your provider will tell you how to do this.</text></h2><h2 title="What is a Kidney Stone?"><text>A kidney stone is a solid piece of material that forms in a kidney. A stone can get stuck as it leaves the kidney. It can lodge in one of your two ureters (the tubes that carry urine from your kidneys to your bladder), the bladder, or the urethra (the tube that carries urine from your bladder to outside your body).</text><text>Kidney stones may be the size of sand or gravel, as large as a pearl, or even larger. A stone can block the flow of your urine and cause great pain. A stone may also break loose and travel through your urinary tract all the way out of your body without causing too much pain.</text><text>There are four major types of kidney stones.</text><detail>Calcium is the most common type of stone. Calcium can combine with other substances, such as oxalate (the most common substance), to form the stone.</detail><detail>A uric acid stone may form when your urine contains too much acid.</detail><detail>A struvite stone may form after an infection in your urinary system.</detail><detail>Cystine stones are rare. The disease that causes cystine stones runs in families.</detail></h2><h2 title="Fluids "><text>Drinking a lot of fluid is important for treating and preventing all types of kidney stones. Staying hydrated (having enough fluid in your body) will keep your urine diluted. This makes it harder for stones to form.</text><detail>Water is best.</detail><detail>You can also drink ginger ale, lemon-lime sodas, and fruit juices.</detail><detail>Drink enough liquids throughout the day to make at least 2 quarts (2 liters) of urine every 24 hours.</detail><detail>Drink enough to have light-colored urine. Dark yellow urine is a sign you are not drinking enough.</detail><text>Limit your coffee, tea, and cola to 1 or 2 cups (250 or 500 milliliters) a day. Caffeine may cause you to lose fluid too quickly, which can make you dehydrated.</text></h2><h2 title="Diet and Calcium Stones"><text>Follow these guidelines if you have calcium kidney stones:</text><detail>Drink plenty of fluids, particularly water.</detail><detail>Eat less salt. Chinese and Mexican food, tomato juice, regular canned foods, and processed foods are often high in salt. Look for low-salt or unsalted products.</detail><detail>Have only 2 or 3 servings a day of foods with a lot of calcium, such as milk, cheese, yogurt, oysters, and tofu.</detail><detail>Eat lemons or oranges, or drink fresh lemonade. Citrate in these foods prevents stones from forming.</detail><detail>Limit how much protein you eat. Choose lean meats.</detail><detail>Eat a low-fat diet.</detail><text>DO NOT take extra calcium or vitamin D, unless the provider who is treating your kidney stones recommends it.</text><detail>Watch out for antacids that contain extra calcium. Ask your provider which antacids are safe for you to take.</detail><detail>Your body still needs the normal amount of calcium you get from your daily diet. Limiting calcium may actually increase the chance that stones will form. </detail><text>Ask your provider before taking vitamin C or fish oil. They may be harmful to you.</text><text>If your provider says you have calcium oxalate stones, you may also need to limit foods that are high in oxalate. These foods include:</text><detail>Fruits: rhubarb, currants, canned fruit salad, strawberries, and Concord grapes</detail><detail>Vegetables: beets, leeks, summer squash, sweet potatoes, spinach, and tomato soup</detail><detail>Drinks: tea and instant coffee</detail><detail>Other foods: grits, tofu, nuts, and chocolate </detail></h2><h2 title="Diet and Uric Acid Stones "><text>Avoid these foods if you have uric acid stones: </text><detail>Alcohol</detail><detail>Anchovies</detail><detail>Asparagus</detail><detail>Baking or brewer's yeast</detail><detail>Cauliflower</detail><detail>Consommé</detail><detail>Gravy</detail><detail>Herring</detail><detail>Legumes (dried beans and peas)</detail><detail>Mushrooms</detail><detail>Oils</detail><detail>Organ meats (liver, kidney, and sweetbreads)</detail><detail>Sardines</detail><detail>Spinach </detail><text>Other suggestions for your diet include:</text><detail>DO NOT eat more than 3 ounces (85 grams) of meat at each meal.</detail><detail>Avoid fatty foods such as salad dressings, ice cream, and fried foods.</detail><detail>Eat enough carbohydrates.</detail><detail>Eat more lemons and oranges, and drink lemonade because the citrate in these foods stops stones from forming.</detail><detail>Drink plenty of fluids, particularly water. </detail><text>If you are losing weight, lose it slowly. Quick weight loss may cause uric acid stones to form.</text></h2><h2 title="When to Call the Doctor"><text>Call your provider if you have:</text><detail>Very bad pain in your back or side that will not go away</detail><detail>Blood in your urine</detail><detail>Fever and chills</detail><detail>Vomiting</detail><detail>Urine that smells bad or looks cloudy</detail><detail>A burning feeling when you urinate</detail></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>Renal calculi and self-care; Nephrolithiasis and self-care; Stones and kidney - self-care; Calcium stones and self-care; Oxalate stones and self-care; Uric acid stones and self-care</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 7/17/2018"><text>Updated by: Sovrin M.

Jet lag occurs when your body's biological clock is not set with the time zone you are in.</text></h2><h2 title="Causes"><text>Your body follows a 24-hour internal clock called a circadian rhythm. It tells your body when to go to sleep and when to wake up. Cues from your environment, such as when the sun rises and sets, help set this internal clock.</text><text>When you pass through different time zones, it can take your body a few days to adjust to the different time.</text></h2><h2 title="How Does jet lag Feel?"><text>You may feel like it is time to go to bed several hours before bedtime. The more time zones you pass through, the worse your jet lag can be. Also, traveling east can be harder to adjust to because you lose time.</text><text>Symptoms of jet lag include:</text><detail>Trouble falling asleep or waking up</detail><detail>Tiredness during the day</detail><detail>Confusion</detail><detail>General feeling of not being well</detail><detail>Headache</detail><detail>Irritability</detail><detail>Stomach upset</detail><detail>Sore muscles </detail></h2><h2 title="Tips for Prevention"><text>Before your trip:</text><detail>Get plenty of rest, eat healthy foods, and get some exercise.</detail><detail>Consider going to bed earlier for a couple of nights before leaving if you are traveling east. Go to bed later for a couple of nights if you are traveling west. This will help reset your internal clock before you travel. </detail><text>While in flight:</text><detail>Do not sleep unless it matches the bedtime of your destination. While awake, get up and walk around a few times.</detail><detail>During stopovers, make yourself comfortable and get some rest.</detail><detail>Drink plenty of water, but avoid heavy meals, alcohol, and caffeine. </detail><text>Melatonin, a hormone supplement, may help decrease jet lag. If you will be in flight during the bedtime of your destination, take some melatonin (3 to 5 milligrams) during that time and try to sleep. Then try taking melatonin several hours before bedtime for several days once you arrive.</text><text>When you arrive:</text><detail>For short trips, try to eat and sleep at your usual times, if possible, while at your destination.</detail><detail>For longer trips, before you leave, try to adapt to the time schedule of your destination. Set your watch to the new time as you begin the trip.</detail><detail>It takes a day to adjust to one to two time zones. So if you travel over three time zones, it will take about two days for your body to adapt.</detail><detail>Stick with your regular exercise routine while you're away. Avoid exercising late in the evening, because it can keep you awake.</detail><detail>If you are traveling for an important event or meeting, try to get to your destination early. This can help your body adjust ahead of time so you are at your best while at the event.</detail><detail>Try not to make any important decisions the first day.</detail><detail>Once you arrive, spend time in the sun.

<item><title>Hysterectomy - vaginal - discharge </title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000285.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>While you were in the hospital, you had a vaginal hysterectomy. Your surgeon made a cut in your vagina. Your uterus was removed through this cut.</text><text>Your surgeon may have also used a laparoscope (a thin tube with a small camera on it) and other instruments that were inserted into your belly through several small incisions.</text><text>Part or all of your uterus was removed. Your fallopian tubes or ovaries may have also been removed. You may go home on the same day as surgery, or you may spend 1 to 2 nights in the hospital.</text></h2><h2 title="What to Expect at Home"><text>It will take at least 3 to 6 weeks to feel better. You will have the most discomfort during the first 2 weeks. Most women will need to use pain medicine regularly and limit their activities during the first 2 weeks. After this period, you may feel tired but will not have much pain. You may not feel like eating much.</text><text>You will not have any scars on your skin unless your doctor used a laparoscope and other instruments that were inserted through your belly. In that case, you will have 2 to 4 scars less than 1-inch (3 cm) long.</text><text>You will likely have light spotting for 2 to 4 weeks. It may be pink, red, or brownish. It should not have a bad odor.</text><text>If you had good sexual function before the surgery, you should continue to have good sexual function afterward. If you had problems with severe bleeding before your hysterectomy, sexual function often improves after surgery. If you have a decrease in your sexual function after your hysterectomy, talk with your health care provider about possible causes and treatments.</text></h2><h2 title="Self-care"><text>Slowly increase how much activity you do every day. Take short walks and increase how far you go gradually. DO NOT jog, do sit-ups, or other sports until you have checked with your provider.</text><text>DO NOT lift anything heavier than a gallon (3.8 L) jug of milk for a few weeks after surgery. DO NOT drive for the first 2 weeks.</text><text>DO NOT put anything into your vagina for the first 8 to 12 weeks. This includes douching or using tampons.</text><text>DO NOT start having sexual intercourse for at least 8 weeks, and only after your provider says it is OK. If you had vaginal repairs along with your hysterectomy, you may need to wait 12 weeks for intercourse. Check with your provider.</text><text>If your surgeon also used a laparoscope:</text><detail>You may remove the wound dressings and take a shower the day after surgery if sutures (stitches), staples, or glue were used to close your skin.</detail><detail>Cover your wounds with plastic wrap before showering for the first week if tape strips (Steri-Strips) were used to close your skin. DO NOT try to wash the Steri-Strips off. They should fall off in about a week. If they are still in place after 10 days, remove them unless your doctor tells you not to.</detail><detail>DO NOT soak in a bathtub or hot tub, or go swimming, until your doctor tells you it is OK. </detail><text>Try eating smaller meals than normal and have healthy snacks in between. Eat plenty of fruits and vegetables and drink 8 cups (2 L) of water a day to keep from getting constipated</text><text>To manage your pain:</text><detail>Your provider will prescribe pain medicines to use at home.</detail><detail>If you are taking pain pills 3 or 4 times a day, try taking them at the same times each day for 3 to 4 days.

Gunshot wounds can cause serious injury, including:</text><detail>Severe bleeding</detail><detail>Damage to tissues and organs</detail><detail>Broken bones</detail><detail>Wound infections</detail><detail>Paralysis</detail><text>The amount of damage depends on the location of the injury and the speed and type of bullet. Gunshot wounds to the head or body (torso) are likely to cause more damage.</text></h2><h2 title="Wound Care"><text>If the wound was severe, you may have had surgery to:</text><detail>Stop bleeding</detail><detail>Clean the wound</detail><detail>Find and remove bullet pieces</detail><detail>Find and remove pieces of broken or shattered bone</detail><detail>Place drains or tubes for body fluids</detail><detail>Remove portions of, or whole, organs </detail><text>Gunshots wounds that pass through the body without hitting major organs, blood vessels, or bone tend to cause less damage.</text><text>You may have bullet pieces that remain in your body. Often these cannot be removed without causing more damage. Scar tissue will form around these remaining pieces, which may cause ongoing pain or other discomfort.</text><text>You may have an open wound or a closed wound, depending on your injury. Your health care provider will tell you how to change your dressing and care for your wound. Keep these tips in mind:</text><detail>Keep the dressing and area around it clean and dry.</detail><detail>Take any antibiotics or pain relievers as directed. Gunshot wounds can get infected because material and debris can get pulled into the wound with the bullet.</detail><detail>Try to elevate the wound so it is above your heart. This helps reduce swelling. You may need to do this while sitting or lying down. You can use pillows to prop up the area.</detail><detail>If your provider says it is OK, you may use an ice pack on the bandage to help with swelling. Ask how often you should apply the ice. Be sure to keep the bandage dry. </detail><text>Your provider may change your dressing for you at first. Once you get the OK to change the dressing yourself:</text><detail>Follow instructions on how to clean and dry the wound.</detail><detail>Be sure to wash your hands after removing an old dressing and before cleaning the wound.</detail><detail>Wash your hands again after cleaning the wound and applying the new dressing.</detail><detail>DO NOT use skin cleansers, alcohol, peroxide, iodine, or soaps with antibacterial chemicals on the wound unless your provider tells you to. These can damage the wound tissue and slow your healing.</detail><detail>DO NOT put any lotion, cream, or herbal remedies on or around your wound without asking your provider first. </detail><text>If you have non-dissolvable stitches or staples, your provider will remove them within 3 to 21 days. DO NOT pull at your stitches or try to remove them on your own.</text></h2><h2 title="Bathing or Showering"><text>Your provider will let you know when it is OK to bathe after you come home. You may need to take sponge baths for several days until your wound has healed enough to shower. Keep in mind:</text><detail>Showers are better than baths because the wound does not soak in the water. Soaking your wound could cause it to reopen.</detail><detail>Remove the dressing before bathing unless told otherwise. Some dressings are waterproof. Or, your provider may suggest covering the wound with a plastic bag to keep it dry.</detail><detail>If your provider gives you the OK, gently rinse your wound with water as you bathe. DO NOT rub or scrub the wound.</detail><detail>Gently pat dry the area around your wound with a clean towel. Let the wound air dry. </detail></h2><h2 title="After Effects"><text>Being shot by a gun is traumatic. You may feel shock, fear for your safety, depression, or anger as a result. These are completely normal feelings for someone who has been through a traumatic event. These feelings are not signs of weakness. You may notice other symptoms as well, such as:</text><detail>Anxiety</detail><detail>Nightmares or trouble sleeping</detail><detail>Thinking about the event over and over</detail><detail>Irritability or being easily upset</detail><detail>Not having much energy or appetite</detail><detail>Feeling sad and withdrawn </detail><text>You need to care for yourself and heal emotionally as well as physically. If you feel overwhelmed by these feelings, or they last more than 3 weeks, contact your provider. If these symptoms are ongoing, they may be signs of post-traumatic stress syndrome, or PTSD. There are treatments that can help you feel better.</text></h2><h2 title="When to Call the Doctor"><text>Call your provider if:</text><detail>Pain gets worse or does not improve after taking pain relievers.</detail><detail>You have bleeding that will not stop after 10 minutes with gentle, direct pressure.</detail><detail>Your dressing comes loose before your provider says it is OK to remove it. </detail><text>You should also call your doctor if you notice signs of an infection, such as:</text><detail>Increased drainage from the wound</detail><detail>Drainage becomes thick, tan, green, or yellow, or smells bad (pus)</detail><detail>Your temperature is above 100°F (37.8°C) or higher for more than 4 hours</detail><detail>Red streaks appear that lead away from the wound </detail></h2><h2 title="Review Date 4/5/2018"><text>Updated by: Jacob L.

Often the pain and stiffness are present all the time.</text></h2><h2 title="More About Your Injury"><text>The capsule of the shoulder joint is made of strong tissue (ligaments) that hold the shoulder bones to each other. When the capsule becomes inflamed, the shoulder bones cannot move freely in the joint. This condition is called frozen shoulder.</text><text>Frozen shoulder may develop with no known cause.

The shoulder can get very painful and stiff before it starts to loosen. It can take as long as 18 to 24 months for complete healing. To help speed healing, your health care provider will likely do the following:</text><detail>Teach you exercises to restore motion in your shoulder joint.</detail><detail>Refer you to a physical therapist.</detail><detail>Prescribe medicines for you to take by mouth. These include drugs to reduce pain and inflammation in the shoulder joint. You may also receive a shot of anti-inflammatory drug or steroid directly into the joint.</detail><text>Most people have a full recovery with full range of motion without surgery.</text></h2><h2 title="Symptom Relief"><text>Using moist heat on your shoulder 3 to 4 times a day may help relieve some pain and stiffness.</text><text>For pain, you can use ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn), or acetaminophen (Tylenol).

<item><title>Buying and caring for baby bottles and nipples</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000804.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>Whether you feed your baby breast milk, infant formula, or both, you will need to buy bottles and nipples. You have many choices, so it can be hard to know what to buy. Learn about the different options and how to care for bottles and nipples. </text></h2><h2 title="How to Choose Bottles and Nipples"><text>The type of nipple and bottle you choose will mainly depend on which type your baby will use. Some babies prefer a certain nipple shape, or they may have less gas with certain bottles. Others are less fussy. Start by buying a few different types of bottles and nipples. That way, you can try them out and see what works best for you and your baby.</text></h2><h2 title="Nipples"><text>Nipples can be made from latex or silicone.</text><detail>Latex nipples are softer and more flexible. But some babies are sensitive to latex, and it does not last as long as silicone.</detail><detail>Silicone nipples last longer and tend to hold their shape better. </detail><text>Nipples come in different shapes.</text><detail>They can be dome-shaped, flat, or wide. Flat or wide nipples are shaped more like a mother's breast.</detail><detail>Try different shapes to see which one your baby prefers. </detail><text>Nipples come in different flow rates.</text><detail>You can get nipples that have a slow, medium, or fast flow rate. These nipples are often numbered, 1 is the slowest flow.</detail><detail>Infants usually start with a smaller hole and slower flow. You will increase the size as your baby gets better at feeding and drinks more.</detail><detail>Your baby should be able to get enough milk without having to suck too hard.</detail><detail>If your baby is choking or spitting up, the flow is too fast. </detail></h2><h2 title="Baby Bottles"><text>Baby bottles come in different materials.</text><detail>Plastic bottles are lightweight and will not break if dropped. If you choose plastic, it is best to buy new bottles. Reused or hand-me-down bottles may contain bisphenol-A (BPA). The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has banned the use of BPA in baby bottles due to safety concerns.</detail><detail>Glass bottles do not have BPA and are recyclable, but they can break if dropped. Some manufacturers sell plastic sleeves to prevent bottles from breaking.</detail><detail>Stainless steel bottles are sturdy and will not break, but they may be more expensive.</detail><detail>Disposable bottles have a plastic sleeve inside that you throw away after each use. The liner collapses as baby drinks, which helps prevent air bubbles. Liners save on cleanup, and are handy for traveling. But they add an extra cost, as you need a new liner for every feeding. </detail><text>You can choose from several different bottle shapes and sizes:</text><detail>Standard bottles have straight or slightly rounded sides. They are easy to clean and fill, and you can easily tell how much milk is in the bottle.</detail><detail>Angle-neck bottles are easier to hold. The milk collects at the end of the bottle. This helps prevent your baby from sucking in air. These bottles can be harder to fill and you need to hold them sideways or use a funnel.</detail><detail>Wide bottles have a wide mouth and are short and squat. They are said to be more like a mother's breast, so they may be a good option for babies who go back and forth between breast and bottle.</detail><detail>Vented bottles have a venting system inside to prevent air bubbles. They are said to help prevent colic and gas, but this is unproven. These bottles have a straw-like inner vent, so you will have more parts to keep track of, clean, and assemble. </detail><text>When your baby is small, start with the smaller 4- to 5-ounce (120- to 150-milliliters) bottles. As your baby's appetite grows, you can switch to larger 8- to 9-ounce (240- to 270-milliliters) bottles.</text></h2><h2 title="Cleaning and Care"><text>These tips can help you safely care for and clean baby bottles and nipples:</text><detail>When you first buy bottles and nipples, sterilize them. Place all of the parts in a pan covered with water and boil them for 5 minutes. Then wash with soap and warm water and air dry them.</detail><detail>Clean bottles right after you use them so the milk doesn't dry and become caked onto the bottle. Wash bottles and other parts with soap and warm water. Use a bottle and nipple brush to get at hard-to-reach areas. ONLY use these brushes on baby bottles and parts. Dry bottles and nipples on a drying rack on the counter. Make sure everything is completely dry before using again.</detail><detail>If bottles and nipples are labeled "dishwasher safe," you can wash and dry them in the top rack of the dishwasher.</detail><detail>Throw out cracked or torn nipples. Small pieces of the nipple can come off and cause choking.</detail><detail>Throw out cracked or chipped bottles, which can pinch or cut you or your baby.</detail><detail>Always wash your hands thoroughly before handling bottles and nipples.</detail></h2><h2 title="Review Date 5/14/2017"><text>Updated by: Neil K.

Butter and other animal fats and solid margarine are not the best choices. Choose liquid vegetable oils or margarines made from these oils when possible.</text></h2><h2 title="What to Use When Cooking "><text>When you cook, solid margarine or butter is not the best choice. Butter is high in saturated fat, which can raise your cholesterol. It can also increase your chance of heart disease. Most margarines have some saturated fat plus trans-fatty acids, which can also be bad for you. Both of these fats have health risks.</text><text>Some guidelines for healthier cooking:</text><detail>Use olive or canola oil instead of butter or margarine.</detail><detail>Choose soft margarine (tub or liquid) over harder stick forms.</detail><detail>Choose margarines with liquid vegetable oil, such as olive oil, as the first ingredient.</detail><detail>Even better, choose "light" margarines that list water as the first ingredient. These are even lower in saturated fat.</detail><detail>If you have high cholesterol, talk with your health care provider about using margarines made from plant sterols or stanols. These are made from soybean and pine tree oils, and they can help lower your LDL cholesterol (the bad cholesterol). But these margarines are not yet recommended for children, pregnant women, and people who do not have high cholesterol. </detail></h2><h2 title="What Not to Use When Cooking"><text>You should NOT use:</text><detail>Margarine, shortening, and cooking oils that have more than 2 grams of saturated fat per tablespoon (read the nutrition information labels).</detail><detail>Hydrogenated and partially hydrogenated fats (read the ingredients labels). These are high in saturated fats and trans-fatty acids.</detail><detail>Shortening or other fats made from animal sources, such as lard. </detail></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>Cholesterol - butter; Hyperlipidemia - butter; CAD - butter; Coronary artery disease - butter; Heart disease - butter; Prevention - butter; Cardiovascular disease - butter; Peripheral artery disease - butter; Stroke - butter; Atherosclerosis - butter</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 8/22/2016"><text>Updated by: Laura J.

This article tells you how to take care of yourself when you go home from the hospital.</text></h2><h2 title="When You're in the hospital"><text>You had surgery to repair a bunion. The surgeon made an incision (cut) in your skin to expose the bones and joint of your big toe. Your surgeon then repaired your deformed toe. You may have screws, wires, or a plate holding your toe joint together.</text></h2><h2 title="What to Expect at Home"><text>You may have swelling in your foot. Keep your leg propped up on 1 or 2 pillows under your foot or calf muscle when you are sitting or lying down to reduce swelling. Swelling may last 9 to 12 months.</text></h2><h2 title="Wound Care"><text>Keep the dressing around your incision clean and dry until it is removed. Take sponge baths or cover your foot and dressing with a plastic bag when you take showers if it is OK with your health care provider. Make sure water cannot leak into the bag.</text></h2><h2 title="Activity"><text>You may need to wear a surgical shoe or cast for up to 8 weeks to keep your foot in the right position as it heals.</text><text>You will need to use a walker, cane, or crutches. Check with your surgeon before putting weight on your foot. You may be able to put some weight on your foot and walk short distances 2 or 3 weeks after surgery.</text><text>You will need to do exercises that will strengthen the muscles around your ankle and maintain the range of motion in your foot. Your provider or a physical therapist will teach you these exercises.</text><text>When you are able to wear shoes again, wear only athletic shoes or soft leather shoes for at least 3 months. Choose shoes that have plenty of room in the toe box. DO NOT wear narrow shoes or high heels for at least 6 months, if ever.</text></h2><h2 title="Pain"><text>You will get a prescription for pain medicine. Get it filled when you go home so you have it when you need it. Take your pain medicine before you start having pain so that it does not get too bad.</text><text>Taking ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) or another anti-inflammatory medicine may also help. Ask your provider what other medicines are safe to take with your pain medicine.</text></h2><h2 title="When to Call the Doctor"><text>Call your health care provider if:</text><detail>Your dressing becomes loose, comes off, or gets wet.</detail><detail>You have a fever or chills.</detail><detail>Your foot around the incision is warm or red.</detail><detail>Your incision is bleeding or you have drainage from the wound.</detail><detail>Your pain does not go away after you take pain medicine.</detail><detail>You have swelling, pain, and redness in your calf muscle. </detail></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>Bunionectomy - discharge; Hallux valgus correction - discharge</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 11/27/2016"><text>Updated by: C.

You can also expect:</text><detail>An ultrasound to show your provider where the placenta and baby are located.</detail><detail>Your provider to push on your abdomen to try and turn your baby's position.</detail><detail>Your baby's heartbeat to be monitored.</detail><text>Success is higher if your provider tries this procedure at about 35 to 37 weeks. At this time, your baby is a little smaller, and there is most often more fluid around the baby. Your baby is also old enough in case there is a problem during the procedure that makes it necessary to deliver the baby promptly. This is rare. External version cannot be done once you are in active labor.</text><text>Risks are low for this procedure when a skilled provider does it. Rarely, it may lead to an emergency cesarean birth (C-section) if:</text><detail>Part of the placenta tears away from the lining of your womb</detail><detail>Your baby's heartbeat drops too low, which can happen if the umbilical cord is tightly wrapped around the baby</detail></h2><h2 title="If My Baby Doesn't Turn, Will I Have a C-section?"><text>Most babies who remain breech after an attempt at turning them will be delivered by C-section. Your provider will explain the risk of delivering a breech baby vaginally.</text><text>Today, the option to deliver a breech baby vaginally is not offered in most cases. The safest way for a breech baby to be born is by C-section. </text><text>The danger of breech birth is mostly due to the fact that the largest part of a baby is its head. When the breech baby's pelvis or hips deliver first, the woman's pelvis may not be large enough for the head to be delivered also. This can result in a baby getting stuck in the birth canal, which can cause injury or death.</text><text>The umbilical cord may also be damaged or blocked. This can reduce the baby's oxygen supply.</text><text>If a C-section is planned, it will most often be scheduled for no earlier than 39 weeks. You will have an ultrasound at the hospital to confirm the position of your baby just before the surgery.</text><text>There is also a chance that you will go into labor or your water will break before your planned C-section. If that happens, call your provider right away and go to the hospital. It is important to go in right away if you have a breech baby and your bag of water breaks. This is because there is a higher chance that the cord will come out even before you are in labor. This can be very dangerous for the baby.</text></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>Pregnancy - breech; Delivery - breech</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 11/11/2016"><text>Updated by: Irina Burd, MD, PhD, Associate Professor of Gynecology and Obstetrics at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD.

<item><title>Breastfeeding vs. formula feeding</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000803.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>As a new parent, you have many important decisions to make. One is to choose whether to breastfeed your baby or bottle feed using infant formula.</text><text>Health experts agree that breastfeeding is the healthiest option for both mom and baby. They recommend that babies feed only on breast milk for the first 6 months, and then continue to have breast milk as a main part of their diet until they are at least 1to 2 years old.</text><text>There are very few health problems that make breastfeeding not possible. There are other reasons women are unable to breastfeed, but with good support and knowledge, most of these can be overcome.</text><text>Here are some things to consider when deciding about breastfeeding. The decision about how to feed your baby is a personal one, and only you can decide what is best for you and your family.</text></h2><h2 title="Benefits of Breastfeeding"><text>Breastfeeding is a wonderful way to bond with your little one. Here are some of the many other benefits of breastfeeding:</text><detail>Breast milk naturally has all the nutrients babies need to grow and develop.</detail><detail>Breast milk has antibodies that can help prevent your baby from getting sick.</detail><detail>Breastfeeding can help prevent health problems in your baby, such as allergies, eczema, ear infections, and stomach problems.</detail><detail>Breastfed babies are less likely to be hospitalized with breathing infections.</detail><detail>Breastfed babies are less likely to become obese or have diabetes.</detail><detail>Breastfeeding may help prevent sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS).</detail><detail>Mothers who breastfeed find it easier to lose weight after pregnancy.</detail><detail>Breastfeeding may help lower the risk for breast and ovarian cancers, diabetes, and certain other diseases in mothers. </detail><text>Breastfeeding is also more convenient. You can breastfeed almost anywhere and anytime your baby is hungry. You do not need to make formula before feeding, worry about clean water, or carry it with you when you go out or travel. And you save money on formula, which can cost $1,000 or more a year.</text><text>Breastfeeding is the natural, healthy choice for mom and baby. </text></h2><h2 title="Preparing to Breastfeed"><text>It is true that breastfeeding is not always easy and natural for moms and babies. </text><text>It can take a little time for you both to get the hang of it. It is important to know this up front, so that you can make sure you have all the support and commitment you need if a problem does come up.</text><text>Skin to skin contact at birth will help you and your baby get a good start with breastfeeding. Ask your health care provider to put your baby on your chest, if everyone is healthy and stable after birth.</text><text>Being a new parent takes time, and feeding is no exception to this rule.</text><detail>Breastfed babies will sometimes eat every hour for a while, before they take a long nap. Try to nap when your baby does.</detail><detail>If you need a longer break, you can also express milk (by hand or pump) and have someone else feed the breast milk to your baby.</detail><detail>After a few weeks, a breastfed baby's schedule becomes quite predictable.</detail><text>You do not need to follow a special diet when you breastfeed. It is rare that a baby will seem sensitive to certain foods, like spicy or gassy foods such as cabbage. Speak with your baby's doctor if you think this could be the case.</text></h2><h2 title="Breastfeeding and Work "><text>It is easier than ever before to work and continue to breastfeed. Allowing women to breastfeed often leads to less missed time due to illness, and decreased turnover. </text><text>Hourly workers eligible for overtime pay who work for companies with more than 50 employees are required by law to be given the time and a place to pump. This does not include salaried employees, though most employers will follow these practices. Some states have even broader breastfeeding laws.</text><text>But not all mothers are able to pump their breasts on the job so they can continue to breastfeed. Certain jobs, such as driving a bus or waiting tables, may make it hard to stick to a regular pumping schedule. If you have more than one job or if you travel for work, finding a place and time to pump and store milk may be hard. And, while some employers provide a comfortable place for mothers to pump milk, not all do.</text></h2><h2 title="Overcoming Breastfeeding Problems"><text>Certain problems can get in the way of breastfeeding for some moms:</text><detail>Some breast tenderness and nipple soreness. This is normal in the first week. It can also take a couple of weeks for mother and baby to learn how to breastfeed.</detail><detail>Breast engorgement or fullness.</detail><detail>Plugged milk ducts.</detail><detail>Not enough milk for the baby's needs. Though many women worry about this, it is rare that a mother will produce too little milk. </detail><text>It is well worth doing all you can to overcome breastfeeding challenges. Most mothers find that the early struggles pass quickly, and they settle into a workable and enjoyable feeding routine with their little one.</text></h2><h2 title="Health and Safety Issues"><text>If you are a smoker, it is still a good idea to breastfeed.</text><detail>Breast milk can help to cancel out some of the risks to your baby from exposure to smoking.</detail><detail>If you smoke cigarettes, smoke after breastfeeding, so your baby gets the least amount of nicotine.</detail><text>It is safe to breastfeed your baby if you have hepatitis B or hepatitis C. If your nipples are cracked or bleeding, you should stop nursing. Express your milk and throw it away until your breasts heal.</text><text>Mothers who should not breastfeed include those who:</text><detail>Have HIV or AIDS, as they can pass the virus to their baby.</detail><detail>Are taking certain medicines needed to treat ongoing health problem. If you take medicines for a health problem, ask your provider if it is still safe to breastfeed.</detail><detail>Have an alcohol or drug addiction.</detail></h2><h2 title="Bottle Feeding Your Baby"><text>There is no question that it is best to feed your baby breast milk for as long as you possibly can, even if it is just for the first few months or so. </text><text>A small number of mothers are not able to breastfeed. This can be hard to accept, but it does not make you a bad mom. Infant formula is still a healthy choice, and your baby will get all the necessary nutrients.</text><text>If you choose to feed your baby formula, there are some benefits:</text><detail>Anyone can feed your baby. Grandparents or babysitters can feed your baby while you work or get some well-deserved time with your partner.</detail><detail>You can get round-the-clock help. Your partner can help out with nighttime feedings so you can get more sleep. This can be a bonus for your partner, giving them the chance to bond early on with their little one. Keep in mind though, if you breastfeed, you can also pump your breasts so your partner can feed your baby breast milk.</detail><detail>You may not have to feed as often. Babies digest formula slower, so you may have fewer feeding times. </detail><text>Remember that everything you do as a mother, your love, attention, and care, will help give your baby the best start in life.</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 5/14/2017"><text>Updated by: Neil K.

<item><title>Breast radiation - discharge</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000056.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>You're having radiation treatment for breast cancer.

Many women will not have any change in size.</detail><detail>You may notice these changes for up to 12 months after therapy starts. </detail></h2><h2 title="Skin Care "><text>When you have radiation treatment, a health care provider draws colored markings on your skin. DO NOT remove these markings. These show where to aim the radiation. If they come off, DO NOT redraw them. Tell your provider if they come off. The markings must remain in place until your treatments are done.</text><text>Take care of the treatment area:</text><detail>Wash gently with lukewarm water only. DO NOT scrub. Pat your skin dry.</detail><detail>DO NOT use soaps.</detail><detail>Do not use lotions, ointments, makeup, perfumed powders, or other perfumed products on this area. Ask your doctor what is ok to use.</detail><detail>Keep the area that is being treated out of the direct sun.</detail><detail>DO NOT scratch or rub your skin. </detail><text>Tell your provider if you have any break or opening in your skin. DO NOT put heating pads or ice bags on the treatment area. Wear loose-fitting clothing.</text><text>DO NOT wear a bra, or wear a loose-fitting bra with no underwire. Ask your provider about wearing your breast prosthesis, if you have one.</text></h2><h2 title="Self-care"><text>You need to eat enough protein and calories to keep your weight up while you are having radiation. </text><text>Tips to make eating easier:</text><detail>Choose foods that you like.</detail><detail>Serve foods with gravy, broths, or sauces to make them easier to chew and swallow.</detail><detail>Eat small meals, and eat more often during the day.</detail><detail>Cut your food into small pieces.</detail><detail>Ask your doctor or dentist if artificial saliva might help you. </detail><text>Ask your provider about liquid food supplements.

Learn to pump, collect, and store breast milk. You can continue to give your baby breast milk when you return to work. Find a lactation consultant, also called a breastfeeding expert, for help if you need it. </text></h2><h2 title="Be Prepared"><text>Take time for you and your baby to learn and get good at breastfeeding. Before you go back to work, establish your milk supply. Take care of yourself so you make plenty of breast milk. Try to:</text><detail>Breastfeed or pump on a regular schedule</detail><detail>Drink plenty of fluids</detail><detail>Eat healthy</detail><detail>Get plenty of rest </detail></h2><h2 title="Giving Your Baby a Bottle"><text>Wait until your baby is 3 to 4 weeks old to try a bottle. This gives you and your baby time to get good at breastfeeding first.</text><text>Your baby has to learn to suck from a bottle. Here are ways to help your baby learn to take a bottle.</text><detail>Give your baby a bottle while your baby is still calm, before hunger starts.</detail><detail>Have someone else give your baby the bottle. This way, your baby is not confused why you are not breastfeeding.</detail><detail>Leave the room when someone is giving your baby a bottle. Your baby can smell you and will wonder why you are not breastfeeding. </detail><text>Start bottle feeding about 2 weeks before you go back to work so your baby has time to get used to it. </text></h2><h2 title="Plan How You Will Pump Milk at Work"><text>Buy or rent a breast pump. If you start to pump before you go back to work, you can build up a supply of frozen milk.</text><detail>There are many breast pumps on the market. Pumps may be hand-operated (manual), battery-operated, or electric. You can rent hospital-quality pumps at a medical supply store.</detail><detail>Most mothers find electric pumps the best. They create and release suction on their own, and you can easily learn to use one.</detail><detail>Either a lactation consultant or the nurses at the hospital can help you buy or rent a pump. They can also teach you how to use it. </detail><text>Figure out where you can pump at work. Hopefully there is a quiet, private room you can use. </text><detail>Find out if your workplace has pump rooms for working moms. They often have a comfortable chair, sink, and electric pump.</detail><detail>If pumping at work is going to be hard, build up a store of breast milk before you go back. You can freeze breast milk to give to your baby later. </detail><text>Pump, collect, and store breast milk.</text><detail>Pump 2 to 3 times a day when you are at work. As your baby gets older, you probably will not have to pump as often to keep up your milk supply.</detail><detail>Wash your hands before pumping. </detail><text>Collect breast milk when pumping. You can use:</text><detail>2- to 3-ounce (60 to 90 milliliters) bottles or hard plastic cups with screw-on caps. Make sure they have been washed in hot, soapy water and rinsed well.</detail><detail>Heavy duty bags that fit into a bottle. DO NOT use everyday plastic bags or formula bottle bags. They leak. </detail><text>Store your breast milk.</text><detail>Date the milk before storing it.</detail><detail>Fresh breast milk can be kept at room temperature for up to 8 hours, and refrigerated for 5 to 7 days. </detail><text>You can keep frozen milk:</text><detail>In a freezer compartment inside the refrigerator for 2 weeks</detail><detail>In a separate door refrigerator/freezer for up to 3 to 4 months</detail><detail>In a deep freezer at constant 0 degrees for 6 months </detail><text>DO NOT add fresh breast milk to frozen milk. </text></h2><h2 title="Thawing and Using Breast Milk"><text>To thaw frozen milk:</text><detail>Put it in the refrigerator</detail><detail>Soak it in a bowl of warm water </detail><text>Thawed milk can be refrigerated and used for up to 9 hours.

<item><title>Breast cancer staging</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000911.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>Once your health care team knows you have breast cancer, they will do more tests to stage it. Staging is a tool the team uses to find out how advanced the cancer is. The stage of the cancer depends on the size and location of a tumor, whether it has spread, and how far the cancer has spread. </text><text>Your health care team uses staging to help:</text><detail>Decide the best treatment</detail><detail>Know what kind of follow-up will be needed</detail><detail>Determine your chance of recovery (prognosis)</detail><detail>Find clinical trials you may be able to join </detail></h2><h2 title="Two Types of Staging"><text>There are two types of staging for breast cancer.</text><text>Clinical staging is based on tests done before surgery. These may include:</text><detail>Physical exam</detail><detail>Mammogram</detail><detail>Breast MRI</detail><detail>Breast Ultrasound</detail><detail>Breast Biopsy, either ultrasound or stereotactic</detail><detail>Chest x-ray</detail><detail>CT scan</detail><detail>Bone scan</detail><detail>PET Scan</detail><text>Pathological staging uses the results from lab tests done on breast tissue and lymph nodes removed during surgery. This type of staging will help determine additional treatment and help predict what to expect after treatment ends.</text></h2><h2 title="How Stages are Determined"><text>Stages of breast cancer are defined by a system called TNM:</text><detail>T stands for tumor. It describes the size and location of the main tumor.</detail><detail>N stands forlymph nodes. It describes whether cancer has spread to the nodes. It also tells how many nodes have cancer cells.</detail><detail>M stands formetastasis. It tells whether the cancer has spread to parts of the body away from the breast. </detail></h2><h2 title="What the Stages Mean"><text>Doctors use 7 main stages to describe breast cancer.</text><detail>Stage 0, also called carcinoma in situ. This is cancer that is confined to the lobules or ducts in the breast. It has not spread to surrounding tissue. Lobules are parts of the breast that produce milk. Ducts carry the milk to the nipple. Stage 0 cancer is called noninvasive. This means it has not spread. Some stage 0 cancers become invasive later. But doctors cannot tell which ones will and which will not.</detail><detail>Stage I. The tumor is small (or may be too small to see) and invasive. It may or may not have spread to the lymph nodes close to the breast.</detail><detail>Stage II. There may be no tumor found in the breast, but cancer can be found that has spread to axillary lymph nodes or nodes close to the breastbone. Axillary nodes are nodes found in a chain from under the arm to above the collarbone. There might also be a tumor between 2 and 5 centimeters in the breast with small cancers in some of the lymph nodes. Or, the tumor could be larger than 5 centimeters with no cancer in the nodes.</detail><detail>Stage IIIA. Cancer has spread to 4 to 9 axillary nodes or to nodes near the breastbone but not to other parts of the body. Or, there could be a tumor larger than 5 centimeters and cancer that has spread to 3 axillary nodes or to nodes near the breastbone.</detail><detail>Stage IIIB. The tumor has spread to the chest wall or to the skin of the breast causing an ulcer or swelling. It may also have spread to axillary nodes but not to other parts of the body.</detail><detail>Stage IIIC. Cancer of any size has spread to at least 10 axillary nodes. It may also have spread to the skin of the breast or breast wall, but not to distant parts of the body.</detail><detail>Stage IV. The cancer is metastatic, which means it has spread to other organs such as the bones, lungs, brain, or liver. </detail></h2><h2 title="How Staging Guides Treatment"><text>The type of cancer you have, along with the stage, will help determine your treatment. With stage I, II, or III breast cancer, the main goal is to cure the cancer by treating it and keeping it from coming back. With stage IV, the goal is to improve symptoms and prolong life. In almost all cases, stage IV breast cancer cannot be cured.</text></h2><h2 title="Recurrent Cancer"><text>Cancer can come back after treatment ends. If it does, it can occur in the breast, in distant parts of the body, or in both places. If it does return, it may need to be restaged.</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 10/21/2017"><text>Updated by: Todd Gersten, MD, Hematology/Oncology, Florida Cancer Specialists &amp;amp; Research Institute, Wellington, FL.

<item><title>Breast cancer screening</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000837.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>Breast cancer screenings can help find breast cancer early, before you notice any symptoms. In many cases, finding breast cancer early makes it easier to treat or cure. But screenings also have risks, such as missing signs of cancer. When to start screenings may depend on your age and risk factors.</text></h2><h2 title="Mammograms"><text>A mammogram is the most common type of screening. It is an x-ray of the breast using a special machine. This test is done in a hospital or clinic and only takes a few minutes. Mammograms can find tumors that are too small to feel.</text><text>Mammography is performed to screen women to detect early breast cancer when it is more likely to be cured. Mammography is generally recommended for:</text><detail>Women starting at age 40, repeated every 1 to 2 years. (This is not recommended by all expert organizations.)</detail><detail>All women starting at age 50, repeated every 1 to 2 years.</detail><detail>Women with a mother or sister who had breast cancer at a younger age should consider yearly mammograms. They should begin earlier than the age at which their youngest family member was diagnosed.</detail><text>Mammograms work best at finding breast cancer in women ages 50 to 74. For women younger than age 50, the screening can be helpful, but may miss some cancers. This may be because younger women have denser breast tissue, which makes it harder to spot cancer. It is not clear how well mammograms work at finding cancer in women age 75 and older.</text></h2><h2 title="Breast Exams "><text>This is an exam to feel the breasts and underarms for lumps or unusual changes. Your health care provider may perform a clinical breast exam (CBE). You can also check your breasts on your own. This is called a breast self-exam (BSE). Doing self-exams may help you become more familiar with your breasts. This may make it easier to notice unusual breast changes.</text><text>Keep in mind that breast exams do not reduce the risk of dying from breast cancer. They also do not work as well as mammograms to find cancer. For this reason, you should not rely only on breast exams to screen for cancer.</text><text>Not all experts agree about when to have or start having breast exams. In fact, some groups do not recommend them at all. However, this does not mean you should not do or have breast exams. Some women prefer to have exams.</text><text>Talk with your provider about the benefits and risks for breast exams and if they are right for you.</text></h2><h2 title="MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) "><text>An MRI uses powerful magnets and radio waves to find signs of cancer. This screening is done only in women who have a high risk for breast cancer.</text><text>Women at high risk for breast cancer (greater than 20% to 25% lifetime risk) should have an MRI along with a mammogram every year. You may have a high risk if you have:</text><detail>A family history of breast cancer, most often when your mother or sister had breast cancer at an early age</detail><detail>Lifetime risk for breast cancer is 20% to 25% or higher</detail><detail>Certain BRCA mutations, whether you carry this marker or a first degree relative does and you have not been tested</detail><detail>First degree relatives with certain genetic syndromes (Li-Fraumeni syndrome, Cowden and Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba syndromes) </detail><text>It is not clear how well MRIs work to find breast cancer. Although MRIs find more breast cancers than mammograms, they are also more likely to show signs of cancer when there is no cancer. This is called a false-positive result. For women who have had cancer in one breast, MRIs can be very helpful for finding hidden tumors in the other breast. You should do a MRI screening if you:</text><detail>Are at very high risk for breast cancer (those with a strong family history or genetic markers for breast cancer)</detail><detail>Have very dense breast tissue </detail></h2><h2 title="Benefits and Risks of Screenings"><text>When and how often to have a breast screening test is a choice you must make. Different expert groups do not fully agree on the best timing for screening.</text><text>Before having a mammogram, talk to your provider about the pros and cons. Ask about:</text><detail>Your risk for breast cancer.</detail><detail>Whether screening decreases your chance of dying from breast cancer.</detail><detail>Whether there is any harm from breast cancer screening, such as side effects from testing or overtreatment of cancer when it's discovered. </detail><text>Risks of screenings can include:</text><detail>False-positive results. This occurs when a test shows cancer when there is none. This can lead to having more tests that also have risks. It can also cause anxiety. You may be more likely to have a false-positive result if you are younger, have a family history of breast cancer, have had breast biopsies in the past, or take hormones.</detail><detail>False-negative results. These are tests that come back normal even though there is cancer. Women who have false-negative results do not know they have breast cancer and delay treatment.</detail><detail>Exposure to radiation is a risk factor for breast cancer. Mammograms expose your breasts to radiation.</detail><detail>Overtreatment. Mammograms and MRIs may find slow-growing cancers. These are cancers that may not shorten your life. At this time, it is not possible to know which cancers will grow and spread, so when cancer is found it is usually treated. Treatment can cause serious side effects. </detail></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>Mammogram - breast cancer screening; Breast exam - breast cancer screening; MRI - breast cancer screening</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 7/26/2018"><text>Updated by: Todd Gersten, MD, Hematology/Oncology, Florida Cancer Specialists &amp;amp; Research Institute, Wellington, FL.

<item><title>Break the bonds of emotional eating</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000808.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>Emotional eating is when you eat food to cope with difficult emotions. Because emotional eating has nothing to do with hunger, it is typical to eat a lot more calories than your body needs or will use. </text></h2><h2 title="The Food-Feeling Connection"><text>Food can put a damper on stressful feelings, though the effect is temporary.</text><text>Foods high in fat, sugar, and salt can become more appealing when you are under stress, are in a bad mood, or feel bad about yourself.</text><text>Emotional eating often becomes a habit. If you have used food to soothe yourself in the past, you may crave candy or potato chips anytime you feel bad. The next time you are upset, it becomes even harder to say no to unhealthy food.</text></h2><h2 title="What Causes Emotional Eating"><text>Everyone has bad days, but not everyone uses food to get through them. Some behaviors and thought patterns can increase your chance of becoming an emotional eater.</text><detail>If you have trouble managing your emotions, you may be more likely to use food for that purpose.</detail><detail>Being unhappy with your body may make you more prone to emotional eating. This goes for both men and women.</detail><detail>Dieting can put you at risk.

This may include your family, a social cause, religion, or a sports team.</detail><detail>Write about things you have done that make you proud.</detail><detail>Spend time doing things you are good at. </detail><text>Eat slowly. Emotional eating often means you eat mindlessly and lose track of how much you've taken in. Make yourself slow down and pay attention to the food you are eating.</text><detail>Put down your fork between bites.</detail><detail>Take a moment to taste your food before swallowing.</detail><detail>If you indulge in something like cookies or fried chicken, limit the portion size.</detail><detail>DO NOT eat in front of the TV or computer. It is too easy to overeat when you are distracted by what is on the screen in front of you. </detail><text>Plan ahead. If you know a difficult or stressful time is coming up, set yourself up for healthy eating in advance.</text><detail>Plan healthy meals. Chop vegetables for salad or make a pot of broth-based soup ahead of time so you have hassle-free, filling meals waiting for you.</detail><detail>DO NOT go hungry. When you are both hungry and stressed, pizza and other fast foods become much more tempting.</detail><detail>Stock your kitchen with healthy snacks like hummus and carrot sticks. </detail><text>Make comfort food healthier.

The name BRCA comes from the first two letters of breast cancer.</text></h2><h2 title="What is the BRCA Gene Mutation?"><text>BRCA1 and BRCA2 are genes that suppress malignant tumors (cancer) in humans. When these genes change (become mutated) they do not suppress tumors like they should. So people with BRCA1 and BRCA2 gene mutations are at a higher risk of getting cancer.</text><text>Women with this mutation are at higher risk of getting breast cancer or ovarian cancer. Mutations may also increase a woman's risk of developing:</text><detail>Cervical cancer</detail><detail>Uterine cancer</detail><detail>Colon cancer</detail><detail>Pancreatic cancer</detail><detail>Gallbladder cancer or bile duct cancer</detail><detail>Stomach cancer</detail><detail>Melanoma </detail><text>Men with this mutation are also more likely to get cancer. Mutations may increase a man's risk of developing: </text><detail>Breast cancer</detail><detail>Pancreatic cancer</detail><detail>Testicular cancer</detail><detail>Prostate cancer </detail><text>Only about 5% of breast cancers and 10 to 15% of ovarian cancers are associated with BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations.</text></h2><h2 title="Who Should Think About Being Tested?"><text>Before being tested, you should speak with a genetic counselor to learn more about the tests, and the risks and benefits of testing.</text><text>If you have a family member with breast cancer or ovarian cancer, find out if that person has been tested for the BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation. If that person does have the mutation, you might consider getting tested, too.</text><text>Someone in your family may have the BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation if:</text><detail>Two or more close relatives (parents, siblings, children) have breast cancer before the age of 50</detail><detail>A male relative has breast cancer</detail><detail>A female relative has both breast and ovarian cancer</detail><detail>Two relatives have ovarian cancer</detail><detail>You are of Eastern European (Ashkenazi) Jewish ancestry, and a close relative has breast or ovarian cancer </detail><text>You have a very low chance of having the BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation if:</text><detail>You do not have a relative that had breast cancer before the age of 50</detail><detail>You do not have a relative that had ovarian cancer</detail><detail>You do not have a relative that had male breast cancer </detail></h2><h2 title="How is the Test Done?"><text>Before the test is done, speak to a genetic counselor to decide whether to have the test.</text><detail>Bring with you your medical history, family's medical history, and questions.</detail><detail>You might want to bring someone with you to listen and take notes. It is hard to hear and remember everything. </detail><text>If you decide to be tested, your blood sample is sent to a lab that specializes in genetic testing. That lab will test your blood for the BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations. It can take weeks or months to get the test results.</text><text>When the test results are back, the genetic counselor will explain the results and what they mean for you.</text></h2><h2 title="What Does a Positive Test Result Mean?"><text>A positive test result means you have inherited the BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation.</text><detail>This does not mean you have cancer, or even that you will get cancer. This means you are at a higher risk of getting cancer.</detail><detail>This also means you can or could have passed this mutation on to your children. Each time you have a child there is a 1 in 2 chance your child will get the mutation you have. </detail><text>When you know you are at higher risk of developing cancer, you can decide if you will do anything differently.</text><detail>You may want to be screened for cancer more often, so it can be caught early and treated.</detail><detail>There may be medicine you can take that could reduce your chance of getting cancer.</detail><detail>You may choose to have surgery to remove your breasts or ovaries. </detail><text>None of these precautions will guarantee you will not get cancer.</text></h2><h2 title="What Does a Negative Test Result Mean?"><text>If your test result for the BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations is negative, the genetic counselor will tell you what this means. Your family history will help the genetic counselor understand a negative test result.</text><text>A negative test result does not mean you will not get cancer. It may mean you have the same risk of getting cancer as people who do not have this mutation.</text><text>Be sure to discuss all results of your tests, even negative results, with your genetic counselor. </text></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>Breast cancer - BRCA1 and BRCA2; Ovarian cancer - BRCA1 and BRCA2</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 8/14/2017"><text>Updated by: Todd Gersten, MD, Hematology/Oncology, Florida Cancer Specialists &amp;amp; Research Institute, Wellington, FL.

The person may have stayed in a special unit that helps people with brain injuries.</text></h2><h2 title="What to Expect at Home"><text>People with a serious brain injury improve at their own pace. Some skills, such as movement or speech, may go back and forth between getting better and then worse. But usually there is improvement.</text></h2><h2 title="Behavior and Social Interaction"><text>People may display inappropriate behavior after a brain injury. It is OK to point out when behavior is not appropriate. Explain the reason and suggest a different behavior. Offer praise when the person calms down or changes their behavior.</text><text>Sometimes suggesting a new activity or a new place to go is the best option.</text><text>It is important for family members and others to stay calm.</text><detail>Try to ignore angry behavior. DO NOT make a face or show anger or judgment.</detail><detail>The providers will teach you when to decide to step in and when to ignore certain behavior.</detail></h2><h2 title="Muscles, Joints, and Movement "><text>At home, the person who had the brain injury may need to practice everyday activities. It may help to create a routine. This means certain activities are done at the same time each day.</text><text>The providers will help you decide how independent the person can be and when you can leave them alone. Make sure your home is safe so injuries do not happen. This includes making the bathroom safe, for either a child or an adult, and protecting against falls.</text><text>Family and caregivers may need to help the person with the following:</text><detail>Exercising the elbows, shoulders, and other joints, to keep them loose</detail><detail>Watching for joint tightening (contractures)</detail><detail>Making sure splints are used in the correct way</detail><detail>Making sure arms and legs are in a good position when sitting or lying</detail><detail>Caring for muscle spasticity or spasms</detail><text>If the person is using a wheelchair, they will need follow-up visits with their provider to make sure it fits well. The person also needs to change positions in the wheelchair several times an hour during the day, to help prevent skin ulcers.</text><text>Learn to make your home safer if the person with the brain injury wanders in or from the home.</text></h2><h2 title="Diet and Swallowing "><text>Some people with brain injuries forget about eating. If so, help them learn to add extra calories. Talk with the provider if the person is a child. Children need to get enough calories and nutrition to grow. Ask the provider if you need the advice of a dietitian.</text><text>If the person with the brain injury has problems with swallowing, help them follow any special diet that makes eating safer. Ask the provider what the signs of swallowing problems are. Learn tips to make feeding and swallowing easier and safer.</text></h2><h2 title="Tips for Daily Life"><text>Tips for making clothing easier to put on and take off:</text><detail>DO NOT give the person too many choices.</detail><detail>Velcro is much easier than buttons and zippers. If the clothing has buttons or zippers, they should be in the front.</detail><detail>Use pullover clothes when possible and slip on shoes.</detail><text>Tips for talking to the person with a brain injury (if they have problems understanding):</text><detail>Keep distractions and noise down. Move to a quieter room.</detail><detail>Use simple words and sentences, speak slowly. Keep your voice lower. Repeat if needed. Use familiar names and places. Tell them when you are going to change the subject.</detail><detail>If possible, make eye contact before touching or speaking to them.</detail><detail>Ask questions so the person can answer "yes" or "no." When possible, give clear choices. Use props or visual prompts when possible. DO NOT give the person too many options. </detail><text>When giving instructions:</text><detail>Break down instructions into small and simple steps.</detail><detail>Allow time for the person to understand.</detail><detail>If the person becomes frustrated, take a break or consider redirecting them to another activity.</detail><text>Try using other methods of communicating:</text><detail>You may want to use pointing, hand gestures, or drawings.</detail><detail>Develop a book with pictures of words or photographs to use when communicating about common topics or people.</detail></h2><h2 title="Bladder, Bowels, and Bathing "><text>Have a routine. Once the person finds a bowel routine that works, help them stick with it. Pick a regular time, such as after a meal or a warm bath.</text><detail>Be patient. It may take 15 to 45 minutes for the person to have bowel movements.</detail><detail>Try having the person gently rub their stomach to help stool move through their colon. </detail><text>The person may have problems starting to urinate or emptying all of the urine out of their bladder. The bladder may empty too often or at the wrong time. The bladder may become too full, and they may leak urine out of the overfilled bladder. </text><text>Some men and women may need to use a urinary catheter. This is a thin tube that is inserted into the bladder. Learn how to care for the catheter. </text></h2><h2 title="When to Call the Doctor"><text>Call the person's provider if they have:</text><detail>Problems taking drugs for muscle spasms</detail><detail>Problems moving their joints (joint contracture)</detail><detail>Problems moving around or it is getting harder for them to transfer out of a bed or chair</detail><detail>Skin sores or redness</detail><detail>Pain that is becoming worse</detail><detail>Choking or coughing when eating</detail><detail>Signs of a bladder infection (fever, burning with urination, or frequent urination)</detail><detail>Behavior issues that are hard to manage</detail></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>Head injury - discharge; Head trauma - discharge; Contusion - discharge; Shaken baby syndrome - discharge</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 10/24/2016"><text>Updated by: Amit M.

<item><title>Brain aneurysm repair - discharge</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000123.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>You had a brain aneurysm. An aneurysm is a weak area in the wall of a blood vessel that bulges or balloons out. Once it reaches a certain size, it has a high chance of bursting. It can leak blood and cause bleeding along the surface of the brain. This is also called a subarachnoid hemorrhage. Sometimes bleeding can occur inside the brain.</text><text>You had surgery to prevent the aneurysm from bleeding or to treat the aneurysm after it bled. There are two types of surgery:</text><detail>Open craniotomy, during which the doctor makes a hole in your skull to place a clip on the base of the aneurysm.</detail><detail>Endovascular repair, during which the doctor does surgery on areas of your body through a blood vessel. </detail></h2><h2 title="What to Expect at Home"><text>If you had bleeding before, during, or after surgery you may have some short- or long-term problems. These may be mild or severe. For many people, these problems get better over time.</text><text>If you had either type of surgery you may:</text><detail>Feel sad, angry, or very nervous. This is normal.</detail><detail>Have had a seizure and will take medicine to prevent another one.</detail><detail>Have headaches that may continue for a while. This is common. </detail><text>What to expect after craniotomy and placement of a clip:</text><detail>It will take 3 to 6 weeks to fully recover. If you had bleeding from your aneurysm this may take longer. You may feel tired for up to 12 or more weeks.</detail><detail>If you had a stroke or brain injury from the bleeding, you may have permanent problems such as trouble with speech or thinking, muscle weakness, or numbness.</detail><detail>Problems with your memory are common, but these may improve.</detail><detail>You may feel dizzy or confused, or your speech may not be normal after the surgery. If you did not have any bleeding, these problems should get better. </detail><text>What to expect after endovascular repair:</text><detail>You may have pain in your groin area.</detail><detail>You may have some bruising around and below the incision. </detail><text>You may be able to start daily activities, such as driving a car, within 1 or 2 weeks if you did not have any bleeding. Ask your health care provider which daily activities are safe for you to do.</text></h2><h2 title="Self-care"><text>Make plans to have help at home while you recover.</text><text>Follow a healthy lifestyle, such as:</text><detail>If you have high blood pressure, keep it under control. Be sure to take the medicines your provider prescribed for you.</detail><detail>DO NOT smoke.</detail><detail>Ask your provider if it is OK for you to drink alcohol.</detail><detail>Ask your provider when it is OK to start sexual activity. </detail><text>Take your seizure medicine if any was prescribed for you. Your doctor may refer you to a speech, physical, or occupational therapist to help you recover from any brain damage.</text><text>If the doctor put a catheter in through your groin (endovascular surgery), it is okay to walk short distances on a flat surface. Limit going up and down stairs to around 2 times a day for 2 to 3 days. DO NOT do yard work, drive, or play sports until your doctor says it is OK to do so.</text><text>Your provider will tell you when your dressing should be changed. DO NOT take a bath or swim for 1 week. </text><text>If you have a small amount of bleeding from the incision, lie down and put pressure where it bleeds for 30 minutes.</text><text>Be sure you understand any instructions about taking medicines such as blood thinners (anticoagulants), aspirin, or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen and naproxen.</text></h2><h2 title="When to Call the Doctor"><text>Call your doctor if you have:</text><detail>A severe headache or a headache that gets worse and you feel dizzy</detail><detail>A stiff neck</detail><detail>Nausea and vomiting</detail><detail>Eye pain</detail><detail>Problems with your eyesight (from blindness to peripheral vision problems to double vision)</detail><detail>Speech problems</detail><detail>Problems thinking or understanding</detail><detail>Problems noticing things around you</detail><detail>Changes in your behavior</detail><detail>Feel weak or lose consciousness</detail><detail>Loss of balance or coordination or loss of muscle use</detail><detail>Weakness or numbness of an arm, leg, or your face. </detail><text>Also, call your doctor if you have:</text><detail>Bleeding at the incision site that does not go away after you apply pressure</detail><detail>An arm or leg that changes color, becomes cool to touch, or becomes numb</detail><detail>Redness, pain, or yellow or green discharge in or around the incision site</detail><detail>A fever higher than 101°F (38.3°C) or chills </detail></h2><h2 title="Follow-up"><text>Make sure to follow-up with your surgeon's office within 2 weeks of being discharged from the hospital.</text><text>Ask your doctor if you need long-term follow-up and tests, including CT scans or MRIs of your head.</text><text>If you had a cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) shunt placed after aneurysm surgery, you will need regular follow-ups to make sure it functions well. </text></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>Aneurysm repair - cerebral - discharge; Cerebral aneurysm repair - discharge; Coiling - discharge; Saccular aneurysm repair - discharge; Berry aneurysm repair - discharge; Fusiform aneurysm repair - discharge; Dissecting aneurysm repair - discharge; Endovascular aneurysm repair - discharge; Aneurysm clipping - discharge</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 7/4/2016"><text>Updated by: Amit M.

<item><title>Bone marrow (stem cell) donation</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000839.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>Bone marrow is the soft, fatty tissue inside your bones. Bone marrow contains stem cells, which are immature cells that become blood cells. </text><text>People with life-threatening diseases, such as leukemia, lymphoma, and myeloma can be treated with a bone marrow transplant. This is now often called a stem cell transplant. For this type of treatment, bone marrow is collected from a donor. Sometimes, people can donate their own bone marrow.</text><text>Bone marrow donation can be done either by collecting a donor's bone marrow surgically, or by removing stem cells from a donor's blood.</text></h2><h2 title="Types of Bone Marrow Donation "><text>There are two types of bone marrow donation:</text><detail>Autologous bone marrow transplant is when people donate their own bone marrow. "Auto" means self.</detail><detail>Allogenic bone marrow transplant is when another person donates bone marrow. "Allo" means other. </detail><text>With an allogenic transplant, the donor's genes must at least partly match the person's genes. A brother or sister is most likely to be a good match. Sometimes parents, children, and other relatives are good matches. But only about 30% of people who need a bone marrow transplant can find a matching donor in their own family.</text></h2><h2 title="Bone Marrow Registries "><text>The 70% of people who do NOT have a relative who is a good match may be able to find one through a bone marrow registry. The largest one is called Be the Match (bethematch.org). It registers people who would be willing to donate bone marrow and stores their information in a database. Doctors can then use the registry to find a matching donor for a person who needs a bone marrow transplant.</text><text>How to Join a Bone Marrow Registry</text><text>To be listed in a bone marrow donation registry, a person must be:</text><detail>Between the ages of 18 and 60</detail><detail>Healthy and not pregnant </detail><text>People can register online or at a local donor registry drive. Those between the ages of 45 to 60 must join online. The local, in-person drives only accept donors who are younger than age 45. Their stem cells are more likely to help patients than stem cells from older people.</text><text>People who register must either:</text><detail>Use a cotton swab to take a sample of cells from the inside of their cheek</detail><detail>Give a small blood sample (about 1 tablespoon or 15 milliliters) </detail><text>The cells or blood is then tested for special proteins, called human leukocytes antigens (HLA). HLAs help your infection-fighting system (immune system) tell the difference between body tissue and substances that are not from your own body.</text></h2><h2 title="Bone Marrow Matching"><text>Bone marrow transplants work best if the HLAs from the donor and the patient are a close match. If a donor's HLAs match well with a person who needs a transplant, the donor must give a new blood sample to confirm the match. Then, a counselor meets with the donor to discuss the bone marrow donation process.</text></h2><h2 title="What Happens During a Bone Marrow Donation "><text>Donor stem cells can be collected in two ways. </text><text>Peripheral blood stem cell collection. Most donor stem cells are collected through a process called leukapheresis.</text><detail>First, the donor is given 5 days of shots to help stem cells move from the bone marrow into the blood.</detail><detail>During the collection, blood is removed from the donor through a line in a vein (IV). The part of white blood cells that contains stem cells is then separated in a machine and removed to be later given to the recipient.</detail><detail>The red blood cells are returned to the donor through an IV in the other arm. </detail><text>This procedure takes about 3 hours. Side effects include:</text><detail>Headaches</detail><detail>Sore bones</detail><detail>Discomfort from needles in the arms </detail><text>Bone marrow harvest. This minor surgery is done under general anesthesia. This means the donor will be asleep and pain-free during the procedure. The bone marrow is removed from the back of your pelvic bones. The process takes about an hour.</text><text>After a bone marrow harvest, the donor stays in the hospital until they're fully awake and can eat and drink. Side effects include:</text><detail>Nausea</detail><detail>Headache</detail><detail>Fatigue</detail><detail>Bruising or discomfort in the lower back </detail><text>You can resume normal activity in about a week.</text><text>There are very few risks for the donor and no lasting health effects. Your body will replace the donated bone marrow in about 4 to 6 weeks.</text></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>Stem cell transplant - donation; Allogeneic donation; Leukemia - bone marrow donation; Lymphoma - bone marrow donation; Myeloma - bone marrow donation</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 7/26/2018"><text>Updated by: Todd Gersten, MD, Hematology/Oncology, Florida Cancer Specialists &amp;amp; Research Institute, Wellington, FL.

This does not mean that you are a bad parent. As long as you are taking care of your baby's basic needs, the bond will form.</text></h2><h2 title="Tips for Bonding with your Baby"><text>If the birthing process went smoothly, your baby may be very alert at birth. Take this time to hold and look at your baby. This is a great chance to bond. Other bonding moments can occur when you:</text><detail>Breastfeed. If you chose to breastfeed, your baby will become attached to your smell and touch during feedings.</detail><detail>Bottle-feed. During bottle feedings, your baby can become acquainted with your smell and touch, as well.</detail><detail>Hold your baby, especially skin to skin when you can.</detail><detail>Make eye contact with your baby.</detail><detail>Respond to your baby when he cries. Some people worry about spoiling a baby. But you will not spoil your baby with too much attention.</detail><detail>Play with your baby.</detail><detail>Talk, read, and sing to your baby. This helps him become well acquainted with the sound of your voice. </detail></h2><h2 title="Accept Help from Others"><text>When you bring your newborn home, your job is to take care of your baby and bond. This is easier if you have help at home. You may become very tired from all the new responsibilities that come with having a new baby. Let friends and family take on routine chores like laundry, grocery shopping, and cooking.</text></h2><h2 title="Obstacles to Bonding"><text>You may have trouble bonding with your baby if you:</text><detail>Had a long or difficult birthing process</detail><detail>Feel exhausted</detail><detail>Experience mood swings or hormonal changes</detail><detail>Suffer from postpartum depression</detail><detail>Have a baby who needs special medical care </detail><text>Again, this does not mean that you are a bad parent or that you will never form a bond. It just may take more time and effort.</text></h2><h2 title="When to Call your Doctor"><text>After a few weeks of caring for your newborn, if you do not feel like you are bonding or you feel detached or resentful of your baby, talk to a health care provider. If you have postpartum depression, be sure to get professional help for yourself as soon as possible.</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 2/16/2017"><text>Updated by: Neil K.

Germs that can cause long-lasting infection in human blood and disease in humans are called bloodborne pathogens.</text><text>The most common and dangerous germs spread through blood in the hospital are:</text><detail>Hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV). These viruses cause infections and liver damage.</detail><detail>HIV (human immunodeficiency virus). This virus causes HIV/AIDS.</detail><text>You can be infected with HBV, HCV, or HIV if you are stuck with a needle or other sharp object that has touched the blood or bodily fluids of a person who has one of these infections.</text><text>These infections can also spread if infected blood or bloody bodily fluids touch mucous membranes or an open sore or cut. Mucous membranes are the moist parts of your body, such as in your eyes, nose, and mouth.</text><text>HIV can also spread from one person to another through fluid in your joints or spinal fluid. And it can spread through semen, fluids in the vagina, breast milk, and amniotic fluid (the fluid that surrounds a baby in the womb).</text></h2><h2 title="More About Hepatitis and HIV infections"><text>HEPATITIS</text><detail>Symptoms of hepatitis B and hepatitis C may be mild, and not start until 2 weeks to 6 months after contact with the virus. Sometimes, there are no symptoms.</detail><detail>Hepatitis B often gets better on its own and sometimes does not need to be treated. Some people develop a long-term infection that leads to liver damage.</detail><detail>Most people who become infected with hepatitis C develop a long-term infection. After many years, they often have liver damage. </detail><text>HIV</text><text>After someone is infected with HIV, the virus stays in the body. It slowly harms or destroys the immune system. Your body's immune system fights disease and helps you heal. When it is weakened by HIV, you are more likely to get sick from other infections, including ones that would not normally make you sick.</text><text>Treatment can help people with all of these infections.</text><text>Hepatitis B can be prevented by a vaccine. There is no vaccine to prevent hepatitis C or HIV.</text></h2><h2 title="What to do if you are Exposed"><text>If you are stuck with a needle, get blood in your eye, or are exposed to any bloodborne pathogen:</text><detail>Wash the area. Use soap and water on your skin. If your eye is exposed, irrigate with clean water, saline, or a sterile irrigant.</detail><detail>Tell your supervisor right away that you were exposed.</detail><detail>Get medical help right away. </detail><text>You may or may not need lab tests, a vaccine, or medicines.</text></h2><h2 title="Preventing Hepatitis and HIV Infections in the Hospital"><text>Isolation precautions create barriers between people and germs. They help prevent the spread of germs in the hospital.</text><text>Follow standard precautions with all people.</text><text>When you are near or are handling blood, bodily fluids, body tissues, mucous membranes, or areas of open skin, you must use personal protective equipment (PPE).

It takes 1 to 4 hours to receive the blood, depending on how much you need.</text><text>There are several sources of blood, which are described below.</text></h2><h2 title="Blood From the Public (Volunteer Blood Donation)"><text>The most common source of blood is from volunteers in the general public. This kind of donation is also called homologous blood donation.</text><text>Many communities have a blood bank at which any healthy person can donate blood. This blood is tested to see if it matches yours.</text><text>You may have read about the danger of becoming infected with hepatitis, HIV, or other viruses after a blood transfusion. Blood transfusions are not 100% safe. But the current blood supply is thought to be safer now than ever. Donated blood is tested for many different infections. Also, blood centers keep a list of unsafe donors.</text><text>Donors answer a detailed list of questions about their health before they are allowed to donate. Questions include risk factors for infections that can be passed on through their blood, such as sexual habits, drug use, and current and past travel history. This blood is then tested for infectious diseases before it is allowed to be used. </text></h2><h2 title="Directed Donor Blood From a Family Member or Friend"><text>This method involves a family member or friend donating blood before a planned surgery. This blood is then set aside and held only for you, if you need a blood transfusion after surgery.</text><text>Blood from these donors must be collected at least a few days before it is needed. The blood is tested to see if it matches yours. It is also screened for infection.</text><text>Most of the time, you need to arrange with your hospital or local blood bank before your surgery to have directed donor blood.</text><text>It is important to note that there is no evidence that receiving blood from family members or friends is any safer than receiving blood from the general public. In very rare cases, though, blood from family members can cause a condition called graft-versus-host disease. For this reason, the blood needs to be treated with radiation before it can be transfused.</text></h2><h2 title="Autologous Blood Donation (Your own Blood)"><text>Although blood donated by the general public and used for most people is thought to be very safe, some people choose a method called autologous blood donation.</text><text>Autologous blood is blood donated by you, which you later receive if you need a transfusion during or after surgery.</text><detail>You can have blood taken from 6 weeks to 5 days before your surgery.</detail><detail>Your blood is stored and is good for a few weeks from the day it is collected.</detail><detail>If your blood is not used during or after surgery, it will be thrown away. </detail></h2><h2 title="Review Date 8/14/2017"><text>Updated by: Todd Gersten, MD, Hematology/Oncology, Florida Cancer Specialists &amp;amp; Research Institute, Wellington, FL.

But riders are still at risk of being hit by cars. Therefore, you need to ride carefully, obey the laws, and watch for other vehicles. Always be prepared to stop or take evasive action.</text><text>While riding your bicycle:</text><detail>Watch for opening car doors, potholes, children, and animals that may run in front of you.</detail><detail>DO NOT wear headphones or talk on your cellphone.</detail><detail>Be predictable and ride defensively. Ride where drivers can see you. Bicycles are frequently hit because drivers did not know the bikes were there.</detail><detail>Wear brightly colored clothing so that drivers can easily see you. </detail><text>Obey the rules of the road.</text><detail>Ride on the same side of the road as the cars.</detail><detail>At intersections, stop at stop signs and obey traffic lights as cars do.</detail><detail>Check for traffic before turning.</detail><detail>Use correct hand or arm signals.</detail><detail>Stop first before riding out into a street.</detail><detail>Know the law in your city about riding on the sidewalk. In most cities, bicyclists older than 10 must ride in the street. If you must be on the sidewalk, walk your bike. </detail></h2><h2 title="Bike Helmets"><text>The brain is fragile and easily injured. Even a simple fall can cause brain damage that may leave you with lifelong problems.</text><text>When riding a bike, everyone, including adults, should wear helmets. Wear your helmet correctly:</text><detail>Straps should be snug underneath your chin so the helmet will not twist around your head. A helmet that flies off will not protect you or your child.</detail><detail>The helmet should cover your forehead and point straight ahead.</detail><detail>DO NOT wear hats underneath your helmet. </detail><text>Your local sporting goods store, sports facility, or bike shop can help make sure your helmet fits properly. You can also contact the American League of Bicyclists.</text><text>Throwing around bicycle helmets can damage them. If this happens, they will not protect you as well. Be aware that older helmets, passed down from others, may not still offer protection.</text></h2><h2 title="Make Sure you can be Seen at Night"><text>If you ride at night, try to stay on roads that are familiar and brightly lit.</text><text>The following equipment, required in some states, will keep you safer:</text><detail>A front lamp that shines a white light and can be seen from a distance of 300 feet (91 m)</detail><detail>A red reflector that can be seen from the rear at a distance of 500 feet (152 m)</detail><detail>Reflectors on each pedal, or on the shoes or ankles of the bicyclist, that can be seen from 200 feet (61 m)</detail><detail>Reflective clothing, tape, or patches </detail></h2><h2 title="Riding With Infants"><text>Having infants in bike seats makes the bike more difficult to manage and harder to stop.

These are the kind that brake when pedaled backward. With hand brakes, a child's hands should be large enough and strong enough to squeeze the levers.</text><text>Make sure bikes are the right size, rather than a size "your child can grow into." Your child should be able to straddle a bike with both feet on the ground. Children cannot handle oversize bikes and are at risk of falling and other accidents.</text><text>Even when riding on sidewalks, children need to learn to watch for cars pulling out from driveways and alleys. Also, teach children to watch for wet leaves, gravel, and curves.</text><text>Make sure your child is careful about keeping loose pants legs, straps, or shoelaces from getting caught in the spokes of the wheel or bicycle chain.

Talk with your provider before you start a new exercise program. Also ask if it is OK before you do a harder activity.</text><text>Aerobic activity uses your heart and lungs for a long period of time. It also helps your heart use oxygen better and improves blood flow. You want to make your heart work a little harder every time, but not too hard.</text><text>Start slowly. Choose an aerobic activity such as walking, swimming, light jogging, or biking. Do this at least 3 to 4 times a week.</text><text>Always do 5 minutes of stretching or moving around to warm up your muscles and heart before exercising. Allow time to cool down after you exercise.

Go to an indoor shopping mall if it is too cold or snowy to exercise outside. Ask your provider if it is OK for you to exercise when it is below freezing.</text><text>Resistance weight training may improve your strength and help your muscles work together better. This can make it easier to do daily activities. These exercises are good for you. But keep in mind they do not help your heart like aerobic exercise does.</text><text>Check out your weight-training routine with your doctor first. Go easy, and do not strain too hard. It is better to do lighter sets of exercise when you have heart disease than to work out too hard.</text><text>You may need advice from a physical therapist or trainer.

Your provider can give you advice about exercise at your regular medical appointments.</text><text>Know your resting pulse rate. Also know a safe exercising pulse rate. Try taking your pulse during exercise. This way, you can see if your heart is beating at a safe exercise rate. If it is too high, slow down. Then, take it again after exercise to see if it comes back to normal within about 10 minutes.</text><text>You can take your pulse in the wrist area below the base of your thumb.

You should get exercise recommendations and an exercise plan. This may happen before you leave the hospital or soon afterward. DO NOT change your exercise plan before talking with your provider.

<item><title>Bedwetting</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000703.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>Bedwetting or nocturnal enuresis is when a child wets the bed at night more than twice a month after age 5 or 6.</text></h2><h2 title="Causes"><text>The last stage of toilet training is staying dry at night. To stay dry at night, your child's brain and bladder must work together so your child wakes up to go to the bathroom. Some children develop this ability later than others.</text><text>Bedwetting is very common. Millions of children in the United States wet the bed at night. Some children still wet the bed at age 7, or even older. Although the problem usually goes away over time, many children, and even a small number of adults, continue to have bedwetting episodes.</text><text>Bedwetting also runs in families. Parents who wet the bed as children are more likely to have children who wet the bed.</text><text>There are 2 types of bedwetting.</text><detail>Primary enuresis. Children who have never been consistently dry at night. This most often occurs when the body makes more urine overnight than the bladder can hold, and the child does not wake up when the bladder is full. The child's brain has not learned to respond to the signal that the bladder is full. It is not the child's or the parent's fault. This is the most common reason for bedwetting.</detail><detail>Secondary enuresis. Children who were dry for at least 6 months, but started bedwetting again. There are many reasons that children wet the bed after being fully toilet trained. It might be physical, emotional, or just a change in sleep. This is less common, but still not the fault of the child or parent. </detail><text>While less common, physical causes of bedwetting may include:</text><detail>Lower spinal cord lesions</detail><detail>Birth defects of the genitourinary tract</detail><detail>Urinary tract infections</detail><detail>Diabetes </detail></h2><h2 title="Self-care at Home"><text>Remember that your child has no control over bedwetting. So, try to be patient. Your child also may feel embarrassed and ashamed about it, so tell your child that many children wet the bed. Let your child know you want to help. Above all, do not punish your child or ignore the problem. Neither approach will help.</text><text>Take these steps to help your child overcome bedwetting.</text><detail>Help your child understand not to hold urine for a long time.</detail><detail>Make sure your child goes to the bathroom at normal times during the day and evening.</detail><detail>Be sure your child goes to the bathroom before going to sleep.</detail><detail>It is OK to reduce the amount of fluid your child drinks a few hours before bedtime. Just do not overdo it.</detail><detail>Reward your child for dry nights. </detail><text>You might also try using a bedwetting alarm. These alarms are small and easy to buy without a prescription. The alarms work by waking children when they start to urinate. Then they can get up and use the bathroom. </text><detail>Bedwetting alarms work best if you use them every night.</detail><detail>Alarm training can take several months to work properly.</detail><detail>Once your child is dry for 3 weeks, continue using the alarm for another 2 weeks. Then stop.</detail><detail>You may need to train your child more than once. </detail><text>You may also want to use a chart or keep a diary that your children can mark each morning they wake up dry. This is especially helpful for children, ages 5 to 8 years old. Diaries allow you to see patterns in your child's habits that may help. You can also show this diary to your child's doctor. Write down:</text><detail>When your child urinates normally during the day</detail><detail>Any wetting episodes</detail><detail>What your child eats and drinks during the day (including time of meals)</detail><detail>When your child naps, goes to sleep at night, and gets up in the morning </detail></h2><h2 title="When to Call Your Doctor"><text>Always notify your child's health care provider of any bedwetting episodes. A child should have a physical exam and a urine test to rule out urinary tract infection or other causes.</text><text>Contact your child's provider right away if your child is having pain with urination, fever, or blood in the urine. These may be signs of an infection that will need treatment.</text><text>You should also call your child's provider:</text><detail>If your child was dry for 6 months, then started bedwetting again. The provider will look for the cause of the bedwetting before recommending treatment.</detail><detail>If you have tried self-care at home and your child is still wetting the bed. </detail><text>Your child's doctor may prescribe a medicine called DDAVP (desmopressin) to treat bedwetting. It will decrease the amount of urine produced at night. It can be prescribed short-term for sleepovers, or used long-term for months. Some parents find that bedwetting alarms combined with medicine work best. Your child's provider will work with you to find the right solution for you and your child.</text></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>Enuresis; Nocturnal enuresis</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 2/19/2018"><text>Updated by: Neil K.

<item><title>Bacterial vaginosis - aftercare</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000687.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a type of vaginal infection. The vagina normally contains both healthy bacteria and unhealthy bacteria. BV occurs when more unhealthy bacteria grow than healthy bacteria.</text><text>No one knows exactly what causes this to occur. BV is a common problem that can affect women and girls of all ages.</text></h2><h2 title="Symptoms"><text>Symptoms of BV include:</text><detail>White or gray vaginal discharge that smells fishy or unpleasant</detail><detail>Burning when you urinate</detail><detail>Itching inside and outside the vagina </detail><text>You also may not have any symptoms. </text></h2><h2 title="Diagnosis"><text>Your health care provider may do a pelvic exam to diagnose BV. DO NOT use tampons or have sex 24 hours before you see your provider.</text><detail>You will be asked to lie on your back with your feet in stirrups.</detail><detail>The provider will insert an instrument into your vagina called a speculum. The speculum is opened slightly to hold the vagina open while your doctor examines the inside of your vagina and takes a sample of discharge with a sterile cotton swab.</detail><detail>The discharge is examined under a microscope to check for signs of infection. </detail></h2><h2 title="Treatment From Your Doctor"><text>If you have BV, your provider may prescribe:</text><detail>Antibiotic pills that you swallow</detail><detail>Antibiotic creams that you insert into your vagina </detail><text>Be sure you use the medicine exactly as prescribed and follow the instructions on the label. Drinking alcohol with some medicines may upset your stomach, give you strong stomach cramps, or make you sick. DO NOT skip a day or stop taking any medicine early, because the infection may come back.</text><text>You cannot spread BV to a male partner. But if you have a female partner, it is possible it can spread to her. She may need to be treated for BV, as well.</text></h2><h2 title="Self-care and Symptom Relief"><text>To help ease vaginal irritation: </text><detail>Stay out of hot tubs or whirlpool baths.</detail><detail>Wash your vagina and anus with a gentle, non-deodorant soap.</detail><detail>Rinse completely and gently dry your genitals well.</detail><detail>Use unscented tampons or pads.</detail><detail>Wear loose-fitting clothing and cotton underwear.

<item><title>Back pain and sports</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000519.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>Getting plenty of exercise and playing sports is good for overall health. It also adds pleasure and a sense of well-being.</text><text>Almost any sport places some stress on your spine. That is why it's important to keep the muscles and ligaments that support your spine flexible and strong. A healthy spine can help prevent many sports injuries.</text><text>Getting these muscles to the point where they support your spine well is called core strengthening. Ask your health care provider or physical therapist about these strengthening exercises.</text><text>If you had a back injury, talk with your provider about keeping your back safe when you return to sports.</text></h2><h2 title="Bicycling"><text>Although bicycling strengthens the muscles of your legs, it does not do much for the muscles around your spine. Bending your lower spine forward while arching your upper back for long periods can strain your back and neck muscles. Mountain biking on uneven surfaces can cause jarring and sudden compressions (squeezing) on the spine. </text><text>Tips to help make bicycling easier on your back include: </text><detail>Avoid mountain biking.</detail><detail>Ride a bike that fits you properly. Staff at a good bike shop can help you get fitted.</detail><detail>Remember not only to push down on the pedals, but also to pull up on them.</detail><detail>Wear biking gloves and use a handlebar cover to reduce jarring in your upper body.</detail><detail>Put shock absorbers on the front wheel.</detail><detail>A more upright bike can have less pressure on your lower back and neck.</detail><detail>Recumbent bikes place less stress on your back and neck. </detail><text>The muscles that bring your leg up toward your abdomen are called flexors. They are used a lot when you ride a bicycle. Keeping these muscles stretched out is important because it will help keep the proper balance in the muscles around your spine and hips.</text></h2><h2 title="Weightlifting"><text>Weightlifting can put a lot of stress on the spine. This is especially true for people who are middle-aged and older because their spinal disks may dry out and become thinner and more brittle with age. Disks are the "cushions" between the bones (vertebrae) of your spine. </text><text>Along with muscle and ligament injuries, weightlifters are also at risk for a type of stress fracture in the back called spondylolysis.</text><text>To prevent injuries when weightlifting:</text><detail>Do some aerobic exercise and stretch well before lifting to warm up your muscles.</detail><detail>Use training machines rather than free weights. These machines place less stress on your spine and do not require a spotter. Training machines are also easier to learn how to use compared to free weights.</detail><detail>Do more repetitions instead of adding more weight when you are trying to build strength.</detail><detail>Lift only as much as you can safely lift. DO NOT add too much weight.</detail><detail>Learn the proper lifting techniques from someone who is well-trained. Technique is important.</detail><detail>Avoid certain weightlifting exercises that are more stressful on your spine. Some of these are squats, clean-and-jerks, snatches, and dead-lifts.</detail><detail>Ask your provider or trainer whether a weightlifting belt would be helpful for you. </detail></h2><h2 title="Golf "><text>The golf swing requires forceful rotation of your spine, and this puts stress on your spinal muscles, ligaments, joints, and disks. </text><text>Tips to take the stress off your back include:</text><detail>Ask your physical therapist about the best posture and technique for your swing.</detail><detail>Warm up and stretch your muscles in your back and upper legs before starting a round.</detail><detail>Bend with your knees when picking up the golf ball.</detail><detail>On the course, use a push cart (trolley) to wheel your golf bag. You can also drive a golf cart.</detail></h2><h2 title="Running "><text>The disks and the small joints in the back are called facet joints. Running causes repeated jarring and compression on these areas of your lumbar spine.</text><text>Tips to help reduce the stress on your spine include: </text><detail>Avoid running on concrete and uneven surfaces. Instead run on a padded track or soft, even grassy surfaces.</detail><detail>Wear high-quality running shoes with good cushioning. Replace them when they become worn.</detail><detail>Ask your physical therapist about the best running form and motion. Most experts suggest a forward motion, leading with your chest and keeping your head balanced over your chest.</detail><detail>Before taking off on a longer run, warm up and stretch the muscles in your legs and lower back. Learn exercises that strengthen the core muscles deep inside your abdomen and pelvis that support your spine. </detail></h2><h2 title="Tennis "><text>Motions that place stress on your spine while playing tennis include overextending (arching) your back when serving, constant stopping and starting motions, and forceful twisting of your spine when taking shots.</text><text>A tennis coach or your physical therapist can show you different techniques that can help reduce the stress on your back. For example:</text><detail>Bend your knees.</detail><detail>Keeping your abdominal muscles tighter will reduce stress on your spine. Ask about the best ways to serve to avoid overextending your lower back.</detail><text>Before playing, always warm up and stretch the muscles in your legs and lower back. Learn exercises that strengthen the core muscles deep inside your abdomen and pelvis, which support your spine.</text></h2><h2 title="Skiing "><text>Before skiing again after a back injury, learn exercises that strengthen the core muscles deep inside your spine and pelvis. A physical therapist may also help you to build strength and flexibility in the muscles that you use when you twist and turn while skiing.</text><text>Before you start skiing, warm up and stretch the muscles in your legs and lower back. Make sure you only ski down slopes that match your skill level.</text></h2><h2 title="Swimming "><text>Although swimming can strengthen the muscles and ligaments in your spine and legs, it can also stress your spine by:</text><detail>Keeping your lower back extended (arched) when doing strokes on your stomach, such as the crawl or the breaststroke</detail><detail>Turning your neck back every time you take a breath </detail><text>Swimming on your side or back can avoid these movements. Using a snorkel and mask may help decrease the neck turning when you breathe.</text><text>Proper technique when swimming is also important. This includes keeping your body level in the water, tightening your abdominal muscles somewhat, and keeping your head on the surface of the water and not holding it in a lifted position.</text></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>Bicycling - back pain; Golf - back pain; Tennis - back pain; Running - back pain; Weightlifting - back pain; Lumbar pain - sports; Sciatica - sports; Low back pain - sports</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 9/3/2016"><text>Updated by: Linda J.

A stronger core helps lower your risk for further back injuries. </detail><text>If you are overweight, ask your health care provider about ways you can lose some weight. Carrying around extra weight adds stress to your back no matter what kind of work you do.</text><text>Long car rides and getting in and out of the car can be hard on your back. If you have a long commute to work, consider some of these changes:</text><detail>Adjust your car seat to make it easier to enter, sit in, and get out of your car. Bring your seat as far forward as possible to avoid bending forward when you are driving.</detail><detail>If you drive long distances, stop and walk around every hour.</detail><detail>DO NOT lift heavy objects right after a long car ride. </detail></h2><h2 title="Learn How to Lift "><text>Know how much you can safely lift. Think about how much you have lifted in the past and how easy or hard that was. If an object seems too heavy or awkward, get help to move or lift it.</text><text>If your work requires you to do lifting that may not be safe for your back, talk with your boss. Try to find out the most weight you should have to lift. You may need to meet with a physical therapist or occupational therapist to learn how to safely lift this amount of weight.</text><text>Follow these steps when you bend and lift to help prevent back pain and injury:</text><detail>Spread your feet apart to give your body a wide base of support.</detail><detail>Stand as close as possible to the object you are lifting.</detail><detail>Bend at your knees, not at your waist.</detail><detail>Tighten your stomach muscles as you lift the object up or lower it down.</detail><detail>Hold the object as close to your body as you can.</detail><detail>Lift slowly, using the muscles in your hips and knees.</detail><detail>As you stand up with the object, DO NOT bend forward.</detail><detail>DO NOT twist your back while you bend to reach the object, lift the object up, or carry the object.</detail><detail>Squat as you set the object down, using the muscles in your knees and hips.</detail><text>Some providers recommend using a back brace to help support the spine. A brace may help prevent injuries for workers who have to lift heavy objects. But, using a brace too much can weaken the core muscles that support your back, making back pain problems worse.</text></h2><h2 title="Changes at Work"><text>If your back pain is worse at work, it may be that your work station is not set up correctly.</text><detail>If you sit at a computer at work, make sure that your chair has a straight back with an adjustable seat and back, armrests, and a swivel seat.</detail><detail>Ask about having a trained therapist assess your workspace or movements to see if changes, such as a new chair or a cushioned mat under your feet, would help.</detail><detail>Get up and move around during the workday. If you are able, take a 10 to 15 minute walk in the morning before work and at lunchtime.</detail><text>If your work involves physical activity, review the needed motions and activities with your physical therapist. Your therapist may be able to suggest helpful changes. Also, ask about exercises or stretches for the muscles you use most during work. </text><text>Avoid standing for long periods. If you must stand at work, try resting one foot on a stool, then the other foot. Keep switching off during the day.</text><text>Take medicines as needed. Let your boss or supervisor know if you need to take medicines that make you sleepy, such as narcotic pain relievers and muscle relaxant medicines.</text></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>Nonspecific back pain - work; Backache - work; Lumbar pain - work; Pain - back - chronic; Low back pain - work; Lumbago - work</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 12/10/2016"><text>Updated by: Linda J.

<item><title>Crutches and children - proper fit and safety tips</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000640.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>After surgery or an injury, your child may need crutches to walk. Your child needs crutches for support so that no weight is put on your child's leg. Using crutches isn't easy and takes practice. Make sure that your child's crutches fit right and learn some safety tips. </text></h2><h2 title="Fitting Crutches"><text>Ask your child's health care provider to fit the crutches to your child. Proper fit makes using crutches easier and keeps your child from getting hurt when using them. Even if your child is fitted for their crutches:</text><detail>Put the rubber caps on the underarm pads, handgrips, and feet.</detail><detail>Adjust the crutches to the right length. With the crutches upright and your child standing, make sure you can put 2 fingers between your child's underarm and the top of the crutches. Crutch pads against the armpit can give your child a rash and put pressure on nerves and blood vessels in the arm. Too much pressure can damage nerves and blood vessels.</detail><detail>Adjust the height of the handgrips. They should be where your child's wrists are when their arms are hanging by their side or hip. The elbows should be gently bent when standing up and holding the handgrips.</detail><detail>Make sure your child's elbows are slightly bent when starting to use the crutch, then extended when taking a step. </detail></h2><h2 title="Safety Tips"><text>Teach your child to:</text><detail>Always keep crutches nearby in easy reach.</detail><detail>Wear shoes that do not slip off.</detail><detail>Move slowly.</detail><detail>Watch for slippery walking surface. Leaves, ice, and snow are all slippery. Slipping is not generally a problem on wet roads or sidewalks if the crutches have rubber tips. But wet crutch tips on indoor floors can be very slippery.</detail><detail>Never hang on the crutches. This puts pressure on the arm nerve and can cause damage.</detail><detail>Carry a backpack with necessities. This way things are easy to reach and out of the way. </detail><text>Things parents can do:</text><detail>Put away things in your home that could cause your child to trip. This includes electrical cords, toys, throw rugs, and clothes on the floor.</detail><detail>Talk to the school to give your child extra time to go between classes and to avoid crowds in the hallway. See if your child can ask for permission to use the elevators and avoid stairs.</detail><detail>Check the crutch feet for tread. Make sure they are not slippery.</detail><detail>Check the screws on the crutches every few days. They get loose easily. </detail></h2><h2 title="When to Call the Doctor"><text>Call the provider if your child does not seem safe on crutches even after practicing with you. The provider can refer you to a physical therapist who can teach your child how to use crutches.</text><text>If your child complains of numbing, tingling, or loss of feeling in their arm or hand, call the provider.</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 11/27/2016"><text>Updated by: C.

They are not safe for babies.</detail><detail>Crib parts and hardware must be stronger than in the past. </detail><text>If you have an older crib that was made before the new safety standards were put into place:</text><detail>Check with the maker of the crib. They may offer hardware to keep the drop side from moving.</detail><detail>Check the crib often to make sure the hardware is tight and no parts are broken or missing.</detail><detail>Check to see if your crib has been recalled before you use it.</detail><detail>Think about buying a new crib that meets the current standards, if you can. </detail></h2><h2 title="Whether the Crib is new or Older"><text>Always use a firm, tight-fitting mattress. This will help keep the baby from getting trapped between the mattress and the crib.</text><text>Do a crib-safety check. There should be:</text><detail>No missing, loose, broken, or poorly installed screws, brackets, or other hardware on the crib</detail><detail>No cracked or peeling paint</detail><detail>No more than 2 3/8 inches, or 6 centimeters, (about the width of a soda can) between crib slats, so that a baby's body cannot fit through the slats</detail><detail>No missing or cracked slats</detail><detail>No corner posts over 1/16th inch (1.6 millimeters) high, so that they will not catch on the baby's clothing</detail><detail>No cutouts in the headboard or foot board, so that the baby's head will not get trapped </detail></h2><h2 title="Using a Crib"><text>Read and follow the directions to set up, use, and care for the crib.</text><detail>Never use a crib with loose or missing parts or hardware. If parts are missing, stop using the crib and contact the crib maker for the right parts. DO NOT replace them with parts from a hardware store.</detail><detail>Never place a crib near cords from hanging window blinds, curtains, or drapes. Babies can get caught and strangled in the cords.</detail><detail>Hammocks and other swinging devices should not be put onto a crib because they could strangle a baby.</detail><detail>Lower the crib mattress before your baby can sit up on his or her own. The mattress should be at the lowest level before the baby can stand up. </detail><text>Hanging crib toys (mobiles, crib gyms) should be out of the baby's reach.</text><detail>Remove any hanging crib toys when your baby first begins to push up on hands and knees (or when your baby is 5 months old).</detail><detail>These toys can strangle a baby. </detail><text>Children should be taken out of a crib by the time they are 35 inches (90 centimeters) tall.</text></h2><h2 title="Safe Bedding for Children"><text>Though it is rare, some babies die in their sleep without any known reason. This is known as sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS).</text><text>You can do many things to keep your baby safe during sleep and reduce the chance of a SIDS death.</text><detail>Place your baby on his or her back on a firm, tight-fitting mattress.</detail><detail>DO NOT use pillows, bumper pads, quilts, comforters, sheepskins, stuffed toys, or any other object that could suffocate or strangle your baby.</detail><detail>Use a sleeper gown to cover your baby instead of a blanket.</detail><detail>Make sure your baby's head remains uncovered during sleep. </detail><text>DO NOT place your baby on a water bed, sofa, soft mattress, pillow, or other soft surface.</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 5/20/2018"><text>Updated by: Neil K.

<item><title>Counting carbohydrates</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000321.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>Many foods contain carbohydrates (carbs), including:</text><detail>Fruit and fruit juice</detail><detail>Cereal, bread, pasta, and rice</detail><detail>Milk and milk products, soy milk</detail><detail>Beans, legumes, and lentils</detail><detail>Starchy vegetables like potatoes and corn</detail><detail>Sweets like cookies, candy, cake, jam and jelly, honey, and other foods that contain added sugar</detail><detail>Snack foods like chips and crackers </detail><text>Your body quickly turns carbohydrates into a sugar called glucose. This raises your blood sugar, or blood glucose level.</text><text>Most foods that contain carbohydrates are nutritious and are an important part of a healthy diet. The goal is not to limit carbohydrates in the diet completely, but to make sure that you are not eating too many. Eating a regular amount of carbohydrates throughout the day can help keep your blood sugar level steady.</text><text>People with diabetes can better control their blood sugar if they count how many carbohydrates they eat. People with diabetes who take insulin can use carb counting to help them determine the exact dose of insulin they need at meals.</text><text>Your dietitian will teach you a technique called "carb counting."</text></h2><h2 title="Types of Carbohydrates"><text>Your body turns all carbohydrates into energy. There are 3 major types of carbohydrates: </text><detail>Sugars</detail><detail>Starches</detail><detail>Fiber </detail><text>Sugars are found naturally in some foods and added to others. Sugar occurs naturally in these nutrient-rich foods:</text><detail>Fruits</detail><detail>Milk and milk products </detail><text>Many packaged and refined foods contain added sugar:</text><detail>Candy</detail><detail>Cookies, cakes, and pastries</detail><detail>Regular (non-diet) carbonated beverages, such as soda</detail><detail>Heavy syrups, such as those added to canned fruit </detail><text>Starches are found naturally in foods. Your body breaks them down into sugar after you eat them. The following foods have a lot of starch. Many also have fiber. Fiber is the part of food that is not broken down by the body. It slows digestion and helps you feel fuller. This includes:</text><detail>Bread</detail><detail>Cereal</detail><detail>Legumes, such as beans and chickpeas</detail><detail>Pasta</detail><detail>Rice</detail><detail>Starchy vegetables, such as potatoes </detail></h2><h2 title="Counting Your Carbs"><text>Some foods, such as jelly beans, contain only carbohydrates. Others foods, such as animal proteins (all kinds of meat, fish, and eggs), have no carbohydrates.</text><text>Most foods, even vegetables, have some carbohydrates. But most green, non-starchy vegetables are very low in carbohydrates.</text><text>Most adults with diabetes should eat no more than 200 carbohydrate grams per day. The daily recommended amount for adults is 135 grams per day, but each person should have their own carbohydrate goal. Pregnant women need at least 175 grams of carbohydrates each day.</text><text>Packaged foods have labels that tell you how many carbohydrates a food has. They are measured in grams. You can use food labels to count the carbohydrates that you eat. When you are carb counting, a serving equals an amount of food that contains 15 grams of carbohydrate. The serving size listed on a package is not always the same as 1 serving in carbohydrate counting. For example, if a single-serving package of food contains 30 grams of carbohydrate, the package actually contains 2 servings when you are carb counting.</text><text>The food label will say what 1 serving size is and how many servings are in the package. If a bag of chips says that it contains 2 servings and you eat the entire bag, then you will need to multiply the label information by 2. For example, let's say the label on a bag of chips states that it contains 2 servings, and 1 serving of chips provides 11 grams of carbohydrate. If you eat the entire bag of chips, you have eaten 22 grams of carbohydrates.</text><text>Sometimes the label will list sugar, starch, and fiber separately. The carbohydrate count for a food is the total of these. Use only this total number to count your carbs.</text><text>When you count carbs in foods that you cook, you will have to measure the portion of food after cooking it. For example, cooked long grain rice has 15 grams of carbohydrate per 1/3 cup. If you eat a cup of cooked long grain rice, you will be eating 45 grams of carbohydrates.</text><text>Here are some examples of foods and servings sizes that have 15 grams of carbohydrate:</text><detail>½ cup (107 grams) of canned fruit (without the juice or syrup)</detail><detail>1 cup (109 grams) of melon or berries</detail><detail>2 tablespoons (11 grams) of dried fruit</detail><detail>½ cup (121 grams) of cooked oatmeal</detail><detail>1/3 cup of cooked pasta (44 grams) (can vary with the shape)</detail><detail>1/3 cup (67 grams) of cooked long grain rice</detail><detail>¼ cup (51grams) of cooked short grain rice</detail><detail>½ cup (88 grams) cooked beans, peas, or corn</detail><detail>1 slice of bread</detail><detail>3 cups (33 grams) popcorn (popped)</detail><detail>1 cup (240 mililiters) milk or soy milk</detail><detail>3 ounces (84 grams) of baked potato </detail><text>Adding up Your Carbohydrates</text><text>The total amount of carbohydrates you eat in a day is the sum of the carbohydrate counts of everything you eat.</text><text>When you are learning how to count carbs, use a log book or sheet of paper to help you track them. As time passes, it will get easier to estimate your carbohydrates.</text><text>Plan to see a dietitian every 6 months. This will help you refresh your knowledge of carb counting. A dietitian can help you determine the right amount of carbohydrate servings to eat each day, based on your personal caloric needs and other factors. The dietitian can also recommend how to spread out the carbohydrates you eat in your meals and snacks.</text></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>Carb counting; Carbohydrate-controlled diet; Diabetic diet; Diabetes-counting carbohydrates</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 3/16/2016"><text>Updated by: Karen Dente, MD, MA, Nutritionist &amp;amp; Integrative Physician in Prevention and Lifestyle Medicine.

<item><title>Cosmetic breast surgery - discharge</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000273.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>You had cosmetic breast surgery to change the size or shape of your breasts. You may have had a breast lift, breast reduction, or breast augmentation.</text><text>Follow your doctor's instructions on self-care at home.</text></h2><h2 title="When You're in the Hospital"><text>You were probably under general anesthesia (asleep and pain-free). Or you had local anesthesia (awake and pain-free). Your surgery took at least 1 or more hours, depending on the type of procedure you had.</text><text>You woke up with a gauze dressing or surgical bra around your breast and chest area. You may also have drainage tubes coming from your incision areas. Some pain and swelling is normal after the anesthesia wears off. You may also feel tired. Rest and gentle activity will help you recover. Your nurse will help you begin to move around.</text><text>Depending on the type of surgery you had, you spent 1 to 2 days in the hospital.</text></h2><h2 title="What to Expect at Home"><text>It is normal to have pain, bruising, and swelling of the breast or incisions after you get home. Within a few days or weeks, these symptoms will go away. You may have a loss of sensation in your breast skin and nipples after surgery. Sensation may return over time.</text><text>You may need help with your everyday activities for a few days until your pain and swelling decrease.</text><text>Incision scars may take several months to more than a year to fade.</text></h2><h2 title="Activity"><text>While you are healing, limit your physical activities so that you do not stretch your incisions. Try taking short walks as soon as possible to promote blood flow and healing. You may be able to do some activity 1 to 2 days after surgery.</text><text>Your health care provider may show you special exercises and breast-massaging techniques. Do these at home if your provider has recommended them.</text><text>Ask your provider when you can go back to work or start other activities. You may need to wait 7 to 14 days or even longer.</text><text>DO NOT do any heavy lifting, strenuous exercise, or overstretching your arms for 3 to 6 weeks.</text><text>DO NOT drive for at least 2 weeks. DO NOT drive if you are taking narcotic pain medicines. You should have full range of motion in your arms before you start driving again. Ease into driving slowly, since turning the wheel and shifting gears may be difficult.</text></h2><h2 title="Wound Care"><text>You'll need to return to your doctor in a few days to have the drainage tubes removed. Any stitches will be removed within 2 weeks after surgery. If your incisions are covered with surgical glue it doesn't need to be removed and will wear off.
</text><text>Keep the dressings or adhesive strips on your incisions for as long as your doctor told you to. Make sure you have extra bandages in case you need them. You will need to change them daily.</text><text>Keep the incision areas clean, dry, and covered. Check daily for signs of infection (redness, pain, or drainage).</text><text>Once you no longer need dressings, wear a soft, wireless, supportive bra night and day for 2 to 4 weeks.</text><text>You may shower after 2 days (if your drainage tubes have been removed). DO NOT take baths, soak in a hot tub, or go swimming until stitches and drains are removed and your doctor says it is OK.</text><text>Protect your scars from the sun for a year with a strong sunblock (SPF 30 or higher) whenever you are out in the sun.</text></h2><h2 title="Other Self-care"><text>Make sure you eat healthy foods, including lots of fruits and vegetables. Drink plenty of fluids. A healthy diet and plenty of fluids promote bowel movements and prevent infection.</text><text>Your pain should go away over several weeks. Take any pain medicines as your provider told you to. Take them with food and plenty of water. DO NOT apply ice or heat to your breasts unless your doctor tells you that it is OK.</text><text>DO NOT drink alcohol while you are taking pain medicines. DO NOT take aspirin, aspirin-containing drugs, or ibuprofen without your doctor's approval. Ask your doctor which vitamins, supplements, and other medicines are safe to take.</text><text>DO NOT smoke. Smoking slows healing and increases your risk of complications and infection.</text></h2><h2 title="When to Call the Doctor"><text>Call if you have:</text><detail>Increasing pain, redness, swelling, yellow or green drainage, bleeding, or bruising at the incision site(s)</detail><detail>Side effects from medicines, such as rash, nausea, vomiting, or headache</detail><detail>A fever of 100°F (38°C) or higher</detail><detail>Numbness or loss of motion </detail><text>Also call your doctor if you notice the sudden swelling of your breast.</text></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>Breast augmentation - discharge; Breast implants - discharge; Implants - breast - discharge; Breast lift with augmentation - discharge; Breast reduction - discharge</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 1/10/2017"><text>Updated by: David A.

<item><title>Corneal transplant - discharge </title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000243.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>You had a corneal transplant. Most of the tissue of your cornea (the clear surface on the front of your eye) was replaced with tissue from a donor. During your surgery, a small round piece of your cornea was taken out. Then the donated cornea was sewn onto the opening of your eye.</text><text>Your surgeon may have used a newer technique in which only certain layers of the cornea are transplanted. Recovery is often faster with this method.</text><text>Numbing medicine was injected into the area around your eye so you did not feel any pain during surgery. You may have taken a sedative to help you relax.</text></h2><h2 title="What to Expect at Home"><text>The first stage of healing will take about 3 weeks. After this, you will likely need contact lenses or glasses. These may need to be changed or adjusted several times in the first year after your transplant.</text></h2><h2 title="Self-care"><text>DO NOT touch or rub your eye. Your health care provider will give you an eye patch to wear for about 1 to 4 days. This protects the new cornea from injury. You provider may also give you an eye shield for sleeping, showering, or bathing. After you take off the eye patch, you will probably need to wear dark sunglasses during the day.</text><text>You should not drive, operate machinery, drink alcohol, or make any major decisions for at least 24 hours after surgery. The sedative will take this long to fully wear off. Before it does, it may make you very sleepy and unable to think clearly.</text><text>Limit activities that could make you fall or increase pressure on your eye, such as climbing a ladder or dancing. Avoid heavy lifting. Stay away from dust and blowing sand.</text><text>Follow your provider's instructions for using eye drops carefully. The drops help prevent infection. They also help prevent your body from rejecting your new cornea.</text><text>Follow up with your provider as directed. You may need to have stitches removed, and your provider will want to check your healing and eyesight.</text></h2><h2 title="When to Call the Doctor"><text>Call your provider if you have:</text><detail>
   Decreased vision

<item><title>Coping with cancer - managing fatigue</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000916.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>Fatigue is a feeling of tiredness, weakness, or exhaustion. It is different from drowsiness, which can be relieved with a good night's sleep. </text><text>Most people feel fatigue while being treated for cancer. How severe your fatigue is depends on the type of cancer you have, the stage of cancer, and your treatments. Other factors like your general health, diet, and stress level can also add to fatigue.</text><text>Fatigue often goes away after your last cancer treatment. For some people though, it can last for months after treatment ends.</text></h2><h2 title="What Causes Fatigue"><text>Your fatigue could be caused by one or more factors. Here are ways having cancer can cause fatigue.</text><text>Simply having cancer can drain your energy:</text><detail>Some cancers release proteins called cytokines that can make you feel fatigued.</detail><detail>Some tumors can change the way your body uses energy and leave you feeling tired. </detail><text>Many cancer treatments cause fatigue as a side effect:</text><detail>Chemotherapy. You may feel most worn out for a few days after each chemo treatment. Your fatigue may get worse with each treatment. For some people, fatigue is worst about halfway through the full course of chemo.</detail><detail>Radiation. Fatigue often gets more intense with each radiation treatment until about halfway through the cycle. Then it often levels off and stays about the same until the end of treatment.</detail><detail>Surgery. Fatigue is common when recovering from any surgery. Having surgery along with other cancer treatments can make fatigue last longer.</detail><detail>Biologic therapy. Treatments that use vaccines or bacteria to trigger your immune system to fight cancer can cause fatigue. </detail><text>Other factors:</text><detail>Anemia. Some cancer treatments decrease, or kill, red blood cells that carry oxygen from your heart to the rest of your body.</detail><detail>Poor nutrition. Nausea or lost appetite can make it hard to keep your body fueled. Even if your eating habits do not change, your body may have trouble taking in nutrients during cancer treatment.</detail><detail>Emotional stress. Having cancer can make you feel anxious, depressed, or distressed. These emotions can drain your energy and motivation.</detail><detail>Medicines. Many of the medicines for treating pain, depression, insomnia, and nausea can also cause fatigue.</detail><detail>Sleep problems. Pain, distress, and other cancer side effects can make it hard to get truly rested. </detail></h2><h2 title="What you can do"><text>Talk to your health care provider. Keep track of following details so you can tell your provider about your fatigue.</text><detail>When the fatigue started</detail><detail>Whether your fatigue is getting worse over time</detail><detail>Times of day when you feel most fatigued</detail><detail>Anything (activities, people, food, medicine) that seem to make it worse or better</detail><detail>Whether you have trouble sleeping or feel rested after a full night's sleep </detail><text>Knowing the level and trigger of your fatigue can help your provider better treat it.</text><text>Save your energy. Take steps to organize your home and life. Then you can spend your energy doing what matters most to you.</text><detail>Ask friends and family to help you with things like grocery shopping and cooking meals.</detail><detail>If you have kids, ask a friend or babysitter to take them for an afternoon so you can get some quiet time.</detail><detail>Put things you use often within easy reach so you do not have to use energy looking for them.</detail><detail>Save the times of day when you have more energy for doing the things that matter most to you.</detail><detail>Avoid activities that drain your energy.</detail><detail>Take time every day to do things that give you energy or help you relax.</detail><text>Eat well. Make safe nutrition a priority. If you have lost your appetite, eat foods high in calories and protein to keep your energy up.</text><detail>Eat small meals throughout the day instead of 2 or 3 big meals</detail><detail>Drink smoothies and vegetable juice for healthy calories</detail><detail>Eat olive oil and canola oil with pasta, bread, or in salad dressing</detail><detail>Drink water between meals to stay hydrated. Aim for 6 to 8 glasses a day </detail><text>Stay active. Sitting still for too long can make fatigue worse. Some light activity can get your circulation going. You should not exercise to the point of feeling more tired while you are being treated for cancer. But, taking a daily walk with as many breaks as you need can help boost your energy and sleep better.</text></h2><h2 title="When to Call the Doctor"><text>Call your provider if fatigue is making it difficult or impossible for you to manage basic tasks. Call your provider right away if you feel any of these things:</text><detail>Dizzy</detail><detail>Confused</detail><detail>Unable to get out of bed for 24 hours</detail><detail>Lose your sense of balance</detail><detail>Have trouble catching your breath </detail></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>Cancer - related fatigue; CRF</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 12/10/2016"><text>Updated by: Linda J.

The glue is too harsh.</detail><detail>Bring your own, sterilized tools if you get a manicure or pedicure. </detail></h2><h2 title="Your Clothes"><text>Your weight may change during cancer treatment. Some people lose weight and some people gain weight. You might have a surgical scar you do not want to show. The best clothes will be comfortable, fit loosely, and make you feel good. Even a new pair of fun pajamas can brighten your day.</text><detail>Go for soft fabrics that feel good next to your skin.</detail><detail>Try on pants with different kinds of waistlines. DO NOT wear tight pants that cut into your tummy. This can upset your stomach.</detail><detail>Your skin tone may change, so favorite colors may no longer look as flattering.

<item><title>Coping with cancer - hair loss</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000914.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>Many people who go through cancer treatment worry about hair loss. While it may be a side effect of some treatments, it does not happen to everyone. Some treatments are less likely to make your hair fall out. Even with the same drug, some people lose their hair and some do not. Your health care provider can tell you how likely it is that your treatment will make you lose your hair.</text></h2><h2 title="Why Cancer Treatments can Cause Hair Loss"><text>Many chemotherapy drugs attack fast-growing cells. This is because cancer cells divide rapidly. Since the cells in hair follicles also grow rapidly, cancer drugs that go after cancer often attack hair cells at the same time. With chemo, your hair might get thinner, but not all fall out. You also may lose your eyelashes, eyebrows, and pubic hair.</text><text>Like chemo, radiation goes after fast-growing cells. While chemo can cause hair loss all over your body, radiation only affects the hair in the area being treated. </text></h2><h2 title="What to Expect"><text>Hair loss mostly happens 1 to 3 weeks after the first chemo or radiation treatment.</text><text>The hair on your head may come out in clumps. You will probably see hair in your brush, in the shower, and on your pillow.</text></h2><h2 title="Tips to Deal with Hair Loss"><text>If your provider has told you treatment may cause hair loss, you might want to cut your hair short before your first treatment. This could make losing your hair less shocking and upsetting. If you decide to shave your head, use an electric razor and be careful not to cut your scalp.</text><text>Some people get wigs and some cover their heads with scarves or hats. Some people do not wear anything on their heads. What you decide to do is up to you. </text><text>Wig options:</text><detail>If you think you will want to have a wig, go to the salon before your hair falls out so they can set you up with a wig that matches your hair color. Your provider may have names of salons that make wigs for people with cancer.</detail><detail>Try different wig styles to decide what you like best.</detail><detail>If you want, you can also try a different hair color. The stylist can work help you find a color that looks good with your skin tone.</detail><detail>Find out if the cost of the wig is covered by your insurance.</detail><text>Other suggestions:</text><detail>Scarves, hats, and turbans are comfortable options.</detail><detail>Ask your provider if cold cap therapy is right for you. With cold cap therapy, the scalp is cooled. This causes the hair follicles go into a state of rest.

You may find it hard to breathe. You may cough or wheeze more or produce more phlegm. You might also feel anxious and have trouble sleeping or doing your daily activities. This problem is called a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation, or COPD flare-up.</text></h2><h2 title="Causes"><text>Certain illnesses, colds, and lung infections from viruses or bacteria can lead to flare-ups. Other causes may include:</text><detail>Being around smoke or other pollutants</detail><detail>Weather changes</detail><detail>Doing too much activity</detail><detail>Being run-down</detail><detail>Feeling stressed or anxious</detail><text>You can often manage a flare-up right away with medicines and self-care.

This can help you learn the difference between your normal symptoms and signs of a COPD flare-up.</text></h2><h2 title="Warning Signs of COPD Flare-up"><text>Signs of a COPD flare-up last 2 days or more and are more intense than your usual symptoms. The symptoms get worse and just don't go away. If you have a full-blown exacerbation, you may need to go to the hospital.</text><text>Common early signs include:</text><detail>Trouble catching your breath</detail><detail>Noisy, wheezing breathing sounds</detail><detail>Coughing, sometimes with more mucus than usual or a change in the color of your mucus</detail><text>Other possible signs of flare-up include:</text><detail>Not being able to take deep breaths</detail><detail>Difficulty sleeping</detail><detail>Morning headaches</detail><detail>Abdominal pain</detail><detail>Anxiety</detail><detail>Difficulty speaking</detail><detail>Swelling of the ankles or legs</detail><detail>Gray or pale skin</detail><detail>Blue or purple lips or nail tips</detail><detail>Trouble speaking in full sentences</detail></h2><h2 title="What to do at the First Sign of a Flare-up"><text>At the first sign of a flare-up:</text><detail>DO NOT panic. You may be able to keep symptoms from getting worse.</detail><detail>Take medicines as directed for flare-ups. These may include quick-relief inhalers, steroids or antibiotics you take by mouth, anti-anxiety medicines, or medicine through a nebulizer.</detail><detail>Take antibiotics as directed if your provider prescribes them.</detail><detail>Use oxygen if prescribed.</detail><detail>Use pursed lip breathing to save energy, slow your breathing, and help you relax.</detail><detail>If your symptoms do not get better within 48 hours, or your symptoms keep getting worse, call your provider or go to the hospital. </detail></h2><h2 title="How to Prevent COPD Flare-ups"><text>If you have COPD:</text><detail>Stop smoking and avoid secondhand smoke. Avoiding smoke is the best way to slow down damage to your lungs. Ask your provider about stop-smoking programs and other options, such as nicotine-replacement therapy.</detail><detail>Take your medicines as directed.</detail><detail>Ask your provider about pulmonary rehabilitation. This program includes exercise, breathing, and nutrition tips.</detail><detail>See your provider 1 to 2 times per year for check-ups, or more often if directed.</detail><detail>Use oxygen if your provider recommends it. </detail><text>Avoid colds and the flu, you should:</text><detail>Stay away from people with colds.</detail><detail>Wash your hands often. Carry hand sanitizer for times when you cannot wash your hands.</detail><detail>Get all of your recommended vaccines, including a flu shot every year.</detail><detail>Avoid very cold air.</detail><detail>Keep air pollutants, such as fireplace smoke and dust, out of your home. </detail><text>Live a healthy lifestyle:</text><detail>Stay as active as possible. Try short walks and light weight-training. Talk with your provider about ways to get exercise.</detail><detail>Take frequent breaks throughout the day. Rest between daily activities to save your energy and give your lungs time to recover.</detail><detail>Eat a healthy diet rich in lean proteins, fish, fruits, and vegetables. Eat several small meals a day.</detail><detail>DO NOT drink liquids with meals. This will keep you from feeling too full.

These are called comorbidities. People with COPD tend to have more health problems than people who do not have COPD.</text></h2><h2 title="Information"><text>Having other health problems can affect your symptoms and treatments. You may need to visit your doctor more often. You also may need to have more tests or treatments.</text><text>Having COPD is a lot to manage. But try to stay positive. You can protect your health by understanding why you are at risk for certain conditions and learning how to prevent them.</text></h2><h2 title="Other Health Problems you may Have"><text>If you have COPD, you are more likely to have:</text><detail>Repeat infections, such as pneumonia. COPD increases your risk of complications from colds and the flu. It increases your risk of needing to be hospitalized due to lung infection.</detail><detail>High blood pressure in the lungs. COPD may cause high blood pressure in the arteries that bring blood to your lungs. This is called pulmonary hypertension.</detail><detail>Heart disease. COPD increases your risk of heart attack, heart failure, chest pain, irregular heartbeat, and blood clots.</detail><detail>Diabetes. Having COPD increases this risk. Also, some COPD medicines can cause high blood sugar.</detail><detail>Osteoporosis (weak bones). People with COPD often have low levels of vitamin D, are inactive, and smoke. These factors increase your risk of bone loss and weak bones. Certain COPD medicines also may cause bone loss.</detail><detail>Depression and anxiety. It is common for people with COPD to feel depressed or anxious. Being breathless can cause anxiety. Plus, having symptoms slows you down so you can't do as much as you used to.</detail><detail>Heartburn and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). GERD and heartburn can lead to more COPD symptoms and flare-ups.</detail><detail>Lung cancer. Continuing to smoke increases this risk. </detail><text>Many factors play a role in why people with COPD often have other health problems. Smoking is one of the biggest culprits. Smoking is a risk factor for most of the problems above.</text><detail>COPD usually develops in middle age. And people tend to have more health problems as they age.</detail><detail>COPD makes it hard to breathe, which can make it hard to get enough exercise. Being inactive can lead to bone and muscle loss and increase your risk for other health problems.</detail><detail>Certain COPD medicines can increase your risk of other conditions such as bone loss, heart conditions, diabetes, and high blood pressure. </detail></h2><h2 title="Staying Healthy With COPD"><text>Work closely with your doctor to keep COPD and other medical problems under control. Taking the following steps can also help protect your health:</text><detail>Take medicines and treatments as directed.</detail><detail>If you smoke, quit. Also avoid secondhand smoke. Avoiding smoke is the best way to slow down damage to your lungs. Ask your doctor about stop-smoking programs and other options, such as nicotine replacement therapy and tobacco cessation medicines.</detail><detail>Discuss the risks and side effects of your medicines with your doctor. There may be better options available or things you can do to reduce or offset the harms. Tell your doctor if you notice any side effects.</detail><detail>Have a yearly flu vaccine and a pneumonia vaccine to help guard against infections. Wash your hands often. Stay away from people with colds or other infections.</detail><detail>Stay as active as possible. Try short walks and light weight training. Talk with your doctor about ways to get exercise.</detail><detail>Eat a healthy diet rich in lean proteins, fish, whole grains, fruits, and vegetables. Eating several small healthy meals a day can give you the nutrients you need without feeling bloated. An overfull belly can make it hard to breathe.</detail><detail>Talk with your doctor if you feel sad, helpless, or worried.

You take them when you are coughing, wheezing, or having trouble breathing, such as during a flare-up. For this reason, they are also called rescue drugs.</text><text>The medical name of these drugs is bronchodilators, meaning medicines that open the airways (bronchi).

Being stressed or depressed can make COPD symptoms worse and make it harder to care for yourself.</text></h2><h2 title="Information"><text>When you have COPD, caring for your emotional health is just as important as taking care of your physical health. Learning how to deal with stress and anxiety and seeking care for depression can help you manage COPD and feel better in general.</text></h2><h2 title="COPD and Your Emotions"><text>Having COPD can affect your mood and emotions for several reasons:</text><detail>You cannot do all the things you used to do.</detail><detail>You may need to do things much slower than you used to.</detail><detail>You may often feel tired.</detail><detail>You may have a hard time sleeping.</detail><detail>You may feel ashamed or blame yourself for having COPD.</detail><detail>You may be more isolated from others because it is harder to get out to do things.</detail><detail>Breathing problems can be stressful and scary. </detail><text>All of these factors can make you feel stressed, anxious, or depressed.</text></h2><h2 title="How Your Emotions can Affect COPD"><text>Having COPD can change how you feel about yourself. And how you feel about yourself can affect COPD symptoms and how well you care for yourself.</text><text>People with COPD who are depressed may have more COPD flare-ups and may have to go to the hospital more often. Depression saps your energy and motivation. When you are depressed, you may be less likely to:</text><detail>Eat well and exercise.</detail><detail>Take your medicines as directed.</detail><detail>Follow your treatment plan.</detail><detail>Get enough rest. Or, you may get too much rest.</detail><text>Stress is a known COPD trigger. When you feel stressed and anxious, you may breathe faster, which can make you feel short of breath. When it is harder to breathe, you feel more anxious, and the cycle continues, leading you to feel even worse.</text></h2><h2 title="How to Manage Stress and Avoid Depression"><text>There are things you can and should do to protect your emotional health. While you cannot get rid of all the stress in your life, you can learn how to manage it. These suggestions may help you relieve stress and stay positive.</text><detail>Identify the people, places, and situations that cause stress. Knowing what causes you stress can help you avoid or manage it.</detail><detail>Try to avoid things that make you anxious. For example, DO NOT spend time with people who stress you out. Instead, seek out people who nurture and support you. Go shopping during quieter times when there's less traffic and fewer people around.</detail><detail>Practice relaxation exercises. Deep breathing, visualization, letting go of negative thoughts, and muscle relaxation exercises are all simple ways to release tension and reduce stress.</detail><detail>DO NOT take on too much. Take care of yourself by letting go and learning to say no. For example, perhaps you typically host 25 people for Thanksgiving dinner. Cut it back to 8. Or better yet, ask someone else to host. If you work, talk with your boss about ways to manage your workload so you do not feel overwhelmed.</detail><detail>Stay involved. DO NOT isolate yourself. Make time every week to spend time with friends or attend social events.</detail><detail>Practice positive daily health habits. Get up and get dressed every morning. Move your body every day. Exercise is one of the best stress busters and mood boosters around. Eat a healthy diet and get enough sleep every night.</detail><detail>Talk it out. Share your feelings with trusted family or friends. Or talk with a clergy member. DO NOT keep things bottled up inside.</detail><detail>Follow your treatment plan. When your COPD is well-managed, you will have more energy for the things you enjoy.</detail><detail>DO NOT delay. Get help for depression. </detail><text>Feeling angry, upset, sad, or anxious at times is understandable. Having COPD changes your life, and it can be hard to accept a new way of living. However, depression is more than occasional sadness or frustration. Symptoms of depression include:</text><detail>Low mood most of the time</detail><detail>Frequent irritability</detail><detail>Not enjoying your usual activities</detail><detail>Trouble sleeping, or sleeping too much</detail><detail>A big change in appetite, often with weight gain or loss</detail><detail>Increased tiredness and lack of energy</detail><detail>Feelings of worthlessness, self-hate, and guilt</detail><detail>Trouble concentrating</detail><detail>Feeling hopeless or helpless</detail><detail>Repeated thoughts of death or suicide </detail><text>If you have symptoms of depression that last for 2 weeks or more, call your doctor. You do not have to live with these feelings. Treatment can help you feel better.</text></h2><h2 title="When to Call Your Doctor"><text>Call 911, a suicide hot line, or go to the nearest emergency room if you have thoughts of harming yourself or others.
</text><text>Call your doctor if:</text><detail>You hear voices that are not there.</detail><detail>You cry often for no apparent reason.</detail><detail>Your depression has affected your work, school, or family life for longer than 2 weeks.</detail><detail>You have 3 or more symptoms of depression.</detail><detail>You think one of your current medicines may be making you feel depressed. DO NOT change or stop taking any medicines without talking to your doctor.</detail><detail>You think you should cut back on drinking, or a family member or friend has asked you to cut back.</detail><detail>You feel guilty about the amount of alcohol you drink, or you drink alcohol first thing in the morning.</detail><text>You should also call your doctor if your COPD symptoms get worse, despite following your treatment plan.</text></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease - emotions; Stress - COPD; Depression - COPD</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 11/20/2017"><text>Updated by: Laura J.

<item><title>COPD - how to use a nebulizer</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000699.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>A nebulizer turns your COPD medicine into a mist. It is easier to breathe the medicine into your lungs this way. If you use a nebulizer, your COPD medicines will come in liquid form.</text><text>Many people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) do not need to use a nebulizer. Another way to get your medicine is with an inhaler, which is usually just as effective.</text></h2><h2 title="How to use a Nebulizer"><text>With a nebulizer, you will sit with your machine and use a mouthpiece. Medicine goes into your lungs as you take slow, deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes.</text><text>Nebulizers can deliver medicine with less effort than inhalers. You and your doctor can decide if a nebulizer is the best way to get the medicine you need. The choice of device may be based on whether you find a nebulizer easier to use and what type of medicine you take.</text><text>Most nebulizers use air compressors. Some use sound vibrations. These are called "ultrasonic nebulizers." They are quieter, but they cost more.</text><text>Follow these steps to set up and use your nebulizer:</text><detail>Connect the hose to the air compressor.</detail><detail>Fill the medicine cup with your prescription. To avoid spills, close the medicine cup tightly and always hold the mouthpiece straight up and down.</detail><detail>Attach the other end of the hose to the mouthpiece and medicine cup.</detail><detail>Turn on the nebulizer machine.</detail><detail>Place the mouthpiece in your mouth.

<item><title>Considering plastic surgery after a large weight loss</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000958.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>When you lose a lot of weight, such as 100 pounds or more, your skin may not be elastic enough to shrink back to its natural shape. This can cause the skin to sag and hang, especially around the upper face, arms, stomach, breasts, and buttocks. Some people don't like the way this skin looks. In some cases, extra or hanging skin can cause rashes or sores. It may make it hard to get dressed or do some activities. One way to fix this problem is to have plastic surgery to remove the excess skin.</text></h2><h2 title="Who Can Have This Surgery"><text>Plastic surgery to remove extra skin is not right for everyone. You will need to meet with a plastic surgeon to see if you're a good candidate. The doctor will talk with you to make sure you're ready for this type of surgery. Some things to think about before having this surgery include:</text><detail>Your weight. If you are still losing weight, your skin may sag more after the surgery. If you gain the weight back, you could stress the skin where you had the surgery, and compromise the result. The doctor will talk with you about how long after losing weight you should wait before having surgery. In general, your weight should have been stable for at least a year or longer.</detail><detail>Your overall health. As with any surgery, plastic surgery has risks. If you have a health condition, such as heart disease or diabetes, you may have a higher risk for problems after the surgery. Talk with your doctor about whether you are healthy enough for surgery.</detail><detail>Your smoking history. Smoking increases your risk of problems during and after surgery and can make you heal more slowly. Your doctor may suggest you quit smoking before having this surgery. Your doctor may not operate on you if you continue to smoke.</detail><detail>Your expectations. Try to be realistic about how you will look after surgery. It can improve your shape, but it won't get your body back to how it looked before your weight gain. Skin naturally sags with age and this surgery will not stop that. You may also have some scarring from the surgery. </detail></h2><h2 title="Health Benefits"><text>In general, the benefits of this surgery are mostly psychological. You may feel better about yourself and have more confidence if you like the way your body looks. In some cases, removing extra skin may also reduce your risk for rashes and infection. </text></h2><h2 title="Health Risks"><text>As with any surgery, there are risks with plastic surgery after weight loss. There is also a chance you may not be happy with the results of the surgery. </text><text>Your doctor will review the full list of risks with you. These include:</text><detail>Scarring</detail><detail>Bleeding</detail><detail>Infection</detail><detail>Loose skin</detail><detail>Poor wound healing</detail><detail>Blood clots </detail></h2><h2 title="Areas of the Body for Surgery"><text>Plastic surgery after weight loss can be done on many different areas of the body. Depending on what areas you want to treat, you may need several surgeries. Common areas include:</text><detail>Stomach</detail><detail>Thighs</detail><detail>Arms</detail><detail>Breasts</detail><detail>Face and neck</detail><detail>Buttocks and upper thighs </detail><text>Your doctor will talk with you about what areas are best for you to treat. </text></h2><h2 title="Cost of Surgery"><text>Many insurance plans do not pay for plastic surgery after weight loss. They also may not cover any treatment you need if you have a problem with the surgery. Make sure to check with your insurance company before the surgery to find out about your benefits.</text><text>The cost of plastic surgery after weight loss can vary depending on what you have done, your surgeon's experience, and the area where you live. </text></h2><h2 title="After Surgery"><text>You should notice results from the surgery soon after it's done. It takes about three months for swelling to go down and wounds to heal. It can take up to two years to see the final results of the surgery and for scars to fade. Although everyone's results are different, you will get the most from your surgery if you maintain a healthy weight and get regular exercise.</text></h2><h2 title="When to Call the Doctor"><text>Call your doctor right away if you have any of these symptoms after surgery:</text><detail>Shortness of breath</detail><detail>Chest pains</detail><detail>Unusual heartbeat</detail><detail>Fever</detail><detail>Signs of infection such as swelling, pain, redness, and thick or bad-smelling discharge </detail><text>Also call your doctor if you have any other questions.</text></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>Body-contouring surgery; Contouring surgery</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 6/5/2018"><text>Updated by: David A.

<item><title>Compression stockings</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000597.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>You wear compression stockings to improve blood flow in your legs.

Talk to your provider about what kind of compression stockings are right for you. There are many different compression stockings.

You may need to wear them all day.</text><text>The stockings should feel strong around your legs. You will feel the most pressure around your ankles and less pressure higher up your legs.</text></h2><h2 title="Putting on Your Compression Stockings"><text>Put on stockings first thing in the morning before you get out of bed. Your legs have the least amount of swelling early in the morning.</text><detail>Hold the top of the stocking and roll it down to the heel.</detail><detail>Put your foot into the stocking as far as you can. Put your heel in the heel of the stocking.</detail><detail>Pull the stocking up. Unroll the stocking over your leg.</detail><detail>After the top of the stocking is in place, smooth out any wrinkles.</detail><detail>DO NOT let the stockings bunch up or wrinkle.</detail><detail>Knee length stockings should come to 2 fingers below the knee bend.</detail></h2><h2 title="Compression Stockings Can Be Hard to Put on"><text>If it's hard for you to put on the stockings, try these tips:</text><detail>Apply lotion on your legs, but let it dry before you put on the stockings.</detail><detail>Use a little baby powder or cornstarch on your legs. This may help the stockings slide up.</detail><detail>Put on rubber dishwashing gloves to help adjust the stockings and smooth them out.</detail><detail>Use a special gadget called a stocking donner to slide the stocking over your foot. You can buy a donner at a medical supply store or online.</detail></h2><h2 title="Wash Your Stockings Every Day"><text>Keep the stockings clean:</text><detail>Wash the stockings each day with mild soap and water.

<item><title>Communicating with someone with aphasia</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000024.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>Aphasia is loss of the ability to understand or express spoken or written language. It commonly occurs after strokes or traumatic brain injuries. It can also occur in people with brain tumors or degenerative diseases that affect the language areas of the brain.</text><text>Use the tips below for improving communication with someone who has aphasia.</text></h2><h2 title="What to Expect at Home"><text>People who have aphasia have language problems. They may have trouble saying and/or writing words correctly. This type of aphasia is called expressive aphasia. People who have it may understand what another person is saying. If they do not understand what is being said, or if they cannot understand written words, they have what is called receptive aphasia. Some people have a combination of both types of aphasia.</text><text>Expressive aphasia may be non-fluent, in which case a person has trouble:</text><detail>Finding the right words</detail><detail>Saying more than 1 word or phrase at a time</detail><detail>Speaking overall </detail><text>Another kind of expressive aphasia is fluent aphasia. People who have fluent aphasia may be able to put many words together. But what they say may not make sense. They are often unaware that they are not making sense.</text><text>People who have aphasia may become frustrated:</text><detail>When they realize others cannot understand them</detail><detail>When they cannot understand others</detail><detail>When they cannot find the right words </detail><text>Speech and language therapists can work with people who have aphasia and their family or caregivers to improve their ability to communicate.</text><text>The most common cause of aphasia is stroke. Recovery may take up to 2 years, though not everyone fully recovers. Aphasia may also be due to the brain losing function, such as with Alzheimer disease. In such cases, aphasia will not get better.</text></h2><h2 title="Improving Daily Communication"><text>There are many ways to help people with aphasia.</text><text>Keep distractions and noise down.</text><detail>Turn off the radio and TV.</detail><detail>Move to a quieter room.</detail><text>Talk to people who have aphasia in adult language. Do not make them feel as if they are children. Do not pretend to understand them if you do not.</text><text>If a person with aphasia cannot understand you, do not shout. Unless the person also has a hearing problem, shouting will not help. Make eye contact when talking to the person.</text><text>When you ask questions:</text><detail>Ask questions so they can answer you with "yes" or "no."</detail><detail>When possible, give clear choices for possible answers. But do not give them too many choices.</detail><detail>Visual cues are also helpful when you can give them.</detail><text>When you give instructions:</text><detail>Break down instructions into small and simple steps.</detail><detail>Allow time for the person to understand. Sometimes this can be a lot longer than you expect.</detail><detail>If the person becomes frustrated, consider changing to another activity.</detail><text>You can encourage the person with aphasia to use other ways to communicate, such as:</text><detail>Pointing</detail><detail>Hand gestures</detail><detail>Drawings</detail><text>It may help a person with aphasia, as well as their caregivers, to have a book with pictures or words about common topics or people so that communication is easier.</text><text>Always try to keep people with aphasia involved in conversations. Check with them to make sure they understand. But do not push too hard for them to understand, since this may cause more frustration.</text><text>Do not try to correct people with aphasia if they remember something incorrectly.</text><text>Begin to take people with aphasia out more, as they become more confident. This will allow them to practice communicating and understanding in real-life situations.</text><text>When leaving someone with speech problems alone, make sure the person has an ID card that:</text><detail>Has information on how to contact family members or caregivers</detail><detail>Explains the person's speech problem and how best to communicate</detail><text>Consider joining support groups for people with aphasia and their families.</text></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>Stroke - aphasia; Speech and language disorder - aphasia</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 4/30/2018"><text>Updated by: Amit M.

<item><title>Communicating with patients </title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000456.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>Patient education allows patients to play a bigger role in their own care.

Use these guidelines to do a thorough assessment before starting patient education:</text><detail>Gather clues. Talk to the health care team members and observe the patient. Be careful not to make assumptions. Patient teaching based on incorrect assumptions may not be very effective and may take more time.</detail><detail>Get to know your patient.

Make eye contact when appropriate and help your patient feel comfortable with you. Pay attention to the person's concerns.</detail><detail>Gain trust. Show respect and treat each person with compassion and without judgment.</detail><detail>Determine your patient's readiness to learn. Ask your patients about their outlooks, attitudes, and motivations.</detail><detail>Learn the patient's perspective. Talk to the patient about worries, fears, and possible misconceptions. The information you receive can help guide your patient teaching.</detail><detail>Ask the right questions. Ask if the patient has concerns, not just questions. Use open-ended questions that require the patient to reveal more details. Listen carefully. The patient's answers will help you learn the person's core beliefs. This will help you understand the patient's motivation and let you plan the best ways to teach.</detail><detail>Learn about the patient's skills. Find out what your patient already knows. You may want to use the teach-back method (also called the show-me method or closing the loop) to figure out what the patient may have learned from other providers. The teach-back method is a way to confirm that you have explained the information in a way that the patient they understand. Also, find out what skills the patient may still need to develop.</detail><detail>Involve others. Ask if the patient wants other people involved with the care process. It is possible that the person who volunteers to be involved in your patient's care may not be the person your patient prefers to be involved. Learn about the support available to your patient.</detail><detail>Identify barriers and limitations. You may perceive barriers to education, and the patient may confirm them. Some factors, such as low health literacy may be more subtle and harder to recognize.</detail><detail>Take time to establish rapport. Do a comprehensive assessment. It is worth it, because your patient education efforts will be more effective. </detail></h2><h2 title="Review Date 11/20/2017"><text>Updated by: Laura J.

<item><title>Common symptoms during pregnancy</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000583.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>Growing a baby is hard work. Your body will go through a lot of changes as your baby grows and your hormones change. Along with the aches and pains of pregnancy, you will feel other new or changing symptoms.</text><text>Even so, many pregnant women say that they feel healthier than ever. </text></h2><h2 title="Fatigue"><text>Being tired is common during pregnancy. Most women feel tired the first few months, then again toward the end. Exercise, rest, and a proper diet can make you feel less tired. It may also help to take rest breaks or naps every day.</text></h2><h2 title="Problems with Urination"><text>Early on in the pregnancy, you will likely be making more trips to the bathroom.</text><detail>As your uterus grows and rises higher in your abdomen (belly), the need to urinate often may lessen.</detail><detail>Even so, you will continue to urinate more throughout pregnancy. That means that you also need to drink more water, and may be thirstier than before you were pregnant.</detail><detail>As you get closer to delivery and your baby descends into your pelvis, you will need to pee much more, and the amount of urine passed at one time will be less (the bladder holds less due to pressure from the baby). </detail><text>If you have pain when you urinate or a change in urine odor or color, call your health care provider. These could be signs of a bladder infection.</text><text>Some pregnant women also leak urine when they cough or sneeze. For most women, this goes away after the baby is born. If this happens to you, start doing Kegel exercises to strengthen the muscles of your pelvic floor. </text></h2><h2 title="Vaginal Discharge"><text>You may see more vaginal discharge while pregnant. Call your provider if the discharge:</text><detail>Has a foul odor</detail><detail>Has a greenish color</detail><detail>Makes you feel itchy</detail><detail>Causes pain or soreness</detail></h2><h2 title="Constipation"><text>Having a hard time moving the bowels is normal during pregnancy. This is because:</text><detail>Hormone changes during pregnancy slow down your digestive system.</detail><detail>Later in your pregnancy, the pressure from your uterus on your rectum may also worsen the problem.</detail><text>You can ease constipation by:</text><detail>Eating raw fruits and vegetables, such as prunes, to get extra fiber.</detail><detail>Eating whole grain or bran cereals for more fiber.</detail><detail>Using a fiber supplement regularly.</detail><detail>Drinking plenty of water (8 to 9 cups daily).</detail><text>Ask your provider about trying a stool softener. Also ask before using laxatives during pregnancy.</text></h2><h2 title="Heartburn"><text>While you are pregnant, food stays in your stomach and bowels longer. This may cause heartburn (stomach acid moving back up into the esophagus). You can reduce heartburn by:</text><detail>Eating small meals</detail><detail>Avoiding spicy and greasy foods</detail><detail>Not drinking large amounts of liquid before bedtime</detail><detail>Not exercising for at least 2 hours after you eat</detail><detail>Not lying down flat right after a meal</detail><text>If you continue to have heartburn, talk to your provider about medicines that can help.</text></h2><h2 title="Nosebleeds and Bleeding Gums"><text>

 
Some women have nose and gum bleeding while they are pregnant. This is because the tissues in their nose and gums get dry, and the blood vessels dilate and are closer to the surface. You can avoid or reduce this bleeding by:</text><detail>Drinking lots of fluids</detail><detail>Getting lots of vitamin C, from orange juice or other fruits and juices</detail><detail>Using a humidifier (a device that puts water in the air) to decrease dryness of the nose or sinuses</detail><detail>Brushing your teeth with a soft toothbrush to decrease bleeding gums</detail><detail>Maintaining good dental hygiene and using floss every day to keep your gums healthy
</detail></h2><h2 title="Swelling, Varicose Veins, and Hemorrhoids"><text>Swelling in your legs is common. You may see more swelling as you get closer to giving birth. The swelling is caused by your uterus pressing on the veins.</text><detail>You may also notice that the veins in your lower body are becoming larger.</detail><detail>In the legs, these are called varicose veins.</detail><detail>You may also have veins close to your vulva and vagina that swell.</detail><detail>In your rectum, veins that swell are called hemorrhoids.</detail><text>To reduce swelling:</text><detail>Raise your legs and rest your feet on a surface higher than your belly.</detail><detail>Lie on your side in bed. Lying on the left side is better if you can do it comfortably. It also provides better circulation for the baby.</detail><detail>Wear support pantyhose or compression stockings.</detail><detail>Limit salty foods. Salt works like a sponge and makes your body hold more water.</detail><detail>Try not to strain during bowel movements. This can worsen hemorrhoids.</detail><text>Leg swelling that occurs with headaches or high blood pressure can be a sign of a serious medical complication of pregnancy called preeclampsia. It is important to discuss leg swelling with your provider.</text></h2><h2 title="Breathing Problems"><text>Some women feel short of breath at times while they are pregnant. It happens more often in the early part of the pregnancy due to the changes in your hormones. It may also happen again toward the end of your pregnancy because of pressure from the baby. Mild shortness of breath from exercise that quickly gets better is not serious.</text><text>Severe chest pain or shortness of breath that does not go away can be a sign of a serious medical complication. Call 911 or go to an emergency room right away if you have these symptoms.</text><text>You may get short of breath again in the later weeks of pregnancy. This is because the uterus takes up so much room that your lungs do not have as much space to expand.</text><text>Doing these things might help with shortness of breath:</text><detail>Sitting up straight</detail><detail>Sleeping propped up on a pillow</detail><detail>Resting when you feel short of breath</detail><detail>Moving at a slower pace</detail><text>If you suddenly have a hard time breathing that is unusual for you, see your provider right away or go to the emergency room. </text></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>Prenatal care - common symptoms</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 10/4/2016"><text>Updated by: John D.

<item><title>Colles wrist fracture - aftercare</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000896.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>The radius is the larger of the two bones between your elbow and wrist. A Colles fracture is a break in the radius close to the wrist. It was named for the surgeon who first described it. Typically, the break is located about an inch (2.5 centimeters) below where the bone joins the wrist.</text><text>A Colles fracture is a common fracture that happens more often in women than men. In fact, it is the most common broken bone for women up to the age of 75.</text></h2><h2 title="About Your Injury"><text>A Colles wrist fracture is caused by a forceful injury to the wrist. This may occur due to:</text><detail>Car accident</detail><detail>Contact sports</detail><detail>Falling while skiing, riding a bike, or other activity</detail><detail>Falling on an outstretched arm (most common cause) </detail><text>Having osteoporosis is a major risk factor for wrist fractures. Osteoporosis makes bones brittle, so they need less force to break. Sometimes a broken wrist is the first sign of thinning bones.</text></h2><h2 title="What to Expect"><text>You will likely get a splint to keep your wrist from moving.</text><text>If you have a small fracture and the bone pieces do not move out of place, you will likely wear a splint for 3 to 5 weeks. Some breaks may require you to wear a cast for about 6 to 8 weeks. You may need a second cast if the first one gets too loose as the swelling goes down.</text><text>If your break is severe, you may need to see a bone doctor (orthopedic surgeon). Treatments may include:</text><detail>Closed reduction, a procedure to set (reduce) a broken bone without surgery</detail><detail>Surgery to insert pins and plates to hold your bones in place or replace the broken piece with a metal part </detail></h2><h2 title="Self-care at Home"><text>To help with pain and swelling:</text><detail>Elevate your arm or hand up above your heart. This can help reduce swelling and pain.</detail><detail>Apply an ice pack to the injured area.</detail><detail>Use the ice for 15 to 20 minutes every few hours for the first few days while the swelling goes down.</detail><detail>To prevent skin injury, wrap the ice pack in a clean cloth before applying it. </detail><text>For pain, you can take over-the-counter ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn), or acetaminophen (Tylenol). You can buy these pain medicines without a prescription.</text><detail>Talk with your health care provider before using these medicines if you have heart disease, high blood pressure, kidney disease, or have had stomach ulcers or internal bleeding in the past.</detail><detail>DO NOT take more than the amount recommended on the bottle.</detail><detail>DO NOT give aspirin to children. </detail><text>For severe pain, you may need a prescription pain reliever. </text><text>Follow your provider's instructions about elevating your wrist and using a sling.</text><detail>If you have a cast, follow the instructions for your cast that your provider gave you.</detail><detail>Keep your splint or cast dry. </detail></h2><h2 title="Activity"><text>Exercising your fingers, elbow, and shoulder is important. It can help keep them from losing their function. Talk with your provider about how much exercise to do and when you can do it. Typically, the provider or surgeon will want you to start moving your fingers as soon as possible after the splint or cast is put on.</text></h2><h2 title="Follow-up"><text>The initial recovery from a wrist fracture can take 3 to 4 months or more. You may need physical therapy. </text><text>You should start working with a physical therapist as soon as your provider recommends. The work may seem hard and at times painful. But doing the exercises you are given will speed your recovery.</text><text>It can take anywhere from a few months to a year for your wrist to fully recover its function. Some people have stiffness and pain in their wrist for the rest of their life.</text></h2><h2 title="When to Call the Doctor"><text>After your arm is placed in a cast or splint, see your provider if:</text><detail>Your cast is too loose or too tight.</detail><detail>Your hand or arm is swollen above or below your cast or splint.</detail><detail>Your cast is falling apart or rubs or irritates your skin.</detail><detail>Pain or swelling continues to get worse or becomes severe.</detail><detail>You have numbness, tingling, or coldness in your hand or your fingers look dark.</detail><detail>You cannot move your fingers because of swelling or pain. </detail></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>Distal radius fracture; Broken wrist</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 4/18/2017"><text>Updated by: C.

<item><title>Colic and crying - self-care</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000753.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>If your baby cries for longer than 3 hours a day, your baby might have colic. Colic is not caused by another medical problem. Many babies go through a fussy period. Some cry more than others.</text><text>If you have a baby with colic, you are not alone. One in five babies cry enough that people call them colicky. Colic usually starts when babies are about 3 weeks old. It gets worse when they are between 4 and 6 weeks old. Most of the time, colicky babies get better after they are 6 weeks old, and are completely fine by the time they are 12 weeks old.</text></h2><h2 title="Symptoms"><text>Colic normally begins at about the same time every day. Babies with colic are usually fussier in the evenings.</text><text>Colic symptoms often begin suddenly. Your baby's hands may be in a fist. The legs may curl up and the belly may seem swollen. Crying may last for minutes to hours. Crying often calms down when your baby is tired or when gas or stool is passed.</text><text>Even though colicky babies look like they have belly pain, they eat well and gain weight normally.</text></h2><h2 title="Possible Causes of Colic"><text>Causes of colic may include any of the following:</text><detail>Pain from gas</detail><detail>Hunger</detail><detail>Overfeeding</detail><detail>Baby cannot tolerate certain foods or certain proteins in breast milk or formula</detail><detail>Sensitivity to certain stimuli</detail><detail>Emotions such as fear, frustration, or even excitement </detail><text>People around the baby may also seem worried, anxious, or depressed.</text></h2><h2 title="Seeing Your Baby's Health Care Provider"><text>Your baby's health care provider can often diagnose colic by asking you about the baby's medical history, symptoms, and how long the crying lasts. The provider will perform a physical exam and may do some tests to check your baby. </text><text>The provider needs to make sure your baby does not have other medical problems, such as reflux, a hernia, or intussusception. </text></h2><h2 title="Avoiding Your Baby's Triggers"><text>Foods that are passed through your breast milk to your baby may trigger colic. If your baby is colicky and you are breastfeeding, avoid eating or drinking the following foods for a few weeks to see if that helps.</text><detail>Stimulants, such as caffeine and chocolate.</detail><detail>Dairy products and nuts. Your baby may have allergies to these foods. </detail><text>Some breastfeeding moms avoid eating broccoli, cabbage, beans, and other gas-producing foods. But research has not shown that these foods can have a negative effect on your baby. </text><text>Other possible triggers include:</text><detail>Medicines passed through breast milk. If you are breastfeeding, talk to your own doctor about the medicines you take.</detail><detail>Baby formula. Some babies are sensitive to proteins in formula. Talk to your baby's doctor about switching formulas to see if that helps.</detail><detail>Overfeeding or feeding the baby too quickly. Bottle feeding your baby should take about 20 minutes. If your baby is eating faster, use a nipple with a smaller hole. </detail><text>Talk to a lactation consultant to learn more about the possible causes related to breastfeeding.</text></h2><h2 title="Comforting Your Baby"><text>What comforts one baby may not calm another. And what calms your baby during one episode may not work for the next. But try different techniques and revisit what seems to help, even if it only helps a little.</text><text>If you breastfeed:</text><detail>Allow your baby to finish nursing on the first breast before offering the second. The milk at the end of emptying each breast, called the hind milk, is far richer and sometimes more soothing.</detail><detail>If your baby still seems uncomfortable or is eating too much, offer only one breast as often as you want, over a 2 to 3 hour period. This will give your baby more hind milk. </detail><text>Sometimes it can be really hard to stop your baby from crying. Here are techniques you may want to try:</text><detail>Swaddle your baby. Wrap your baby snugly in a blanket.</detail><detail>Hold your baby. Holding your baby more may help them be less fussy in the evening. This will not spoil your baby. Try an infant carrier that you wear on your body to hold your baby close.</detail><detail>Gently rock your baby. Rocking calms your baby and can help your baby pass gas. When babies cry, they swallow air. They get more gas and more stomach pain, which causes them to cry more. So babies get in a cycle that is hard to break. Try an infant swing if your baby is at least 3 weeks old and can hold their head up.</detail><detail>Sing to your baby.</detail><detail>Hold your baby in an upright position. This helps your baby pass gas and reduces heartburn.</detail><detail>Try placing a warm towel or warm water bottle on the baby's stomach.</detail><detail>Lay babies on their stomach when they are awake and give them back rubs. DO NOT let babies sleep on their stomachs. Babies who sleep on their stomachs have a higher risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS).</detail><detail>Give your baby a pacifier to suck on.</detail><detail>Put your baby in a stroller and go for a walk.</detail><detail>Put your baby in a car seat and go for a drive. If this works, look for a device that makes a car motion and sound.</detail><detail>Put your baby in a crib and turn on something with white noise. You can use a white noise machine, a fan, vacuum cleaner, washing machine, or dishwasher.</detail><detail>Simethicone drops are sold without a prescription and may help reduce gas. This medicine is not absorbed by the body and is safe for infants. A doctor may prescribe stronger medicines if your baby has severe colic. </detail></h2><h2 title="Colic Always Goes Away"><text>Your baby will most likely outgrow colic by 3 to 4 months of age. There are usually no complications from colic.</text><text>Parents can get really stressed when a baby cries a lot. Know when you have reached your limit and ask family members or friends to help. If you feel like you may shake or hurt your baby, get help right away.</text></h2><h2 title="When to Call the Doctor"><text>Call the provider if your baby is:</text><detail>Crying a lot</detail><detail>3 months old and still has colic </detail><text>You need to make sure that your baby does not have any serious medical problems.</text><text>Call your baby's provider right away if:</text><detail>Your baby's behavior or crying pattern changes suddenly</detail><detail>Your baby has a fever, forceful vomiting, diarrhea, bloody stools, or other stomach problems </detail><text>Get help right away for yourself if you feel overwhelmed or have thoughts of harming your baby.</text></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>Infantile colic - self-care; Fussy baby - colic - self-care</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 9/5/2017"><text>Updated by: Neil K.

OTC cold medicines may help relieve symptoms of a cold. </text><text>This article is about OTC cold medicines for children. These cold remedies should be used with caution. They are not recommended for children younger than age 4. </text></h2><h2 title="About OTC Cold Medicines"><text>Cold medicines do not cure or shorten a cold. Most colds go away in 1 to 2 weeks. Often, children get better without needing these medicines.</text><text>OTC cold medicines can help treat cold symptoms to and make your child feel better. They may: </text><detail>Shrink the swollen lining of the nose, throat, and sinuses.</detail><detail>Relieve sneezing and an itchy, runny nose.</detail><detail>Clear mucus from the airways (cough remedies).</detail><detail>Suppress coughs. </detail><text>Most cold medicines also include acetaminophen (Tylenol) or ibuprofen (Advil, Motin) to help relieve headaches, fever, and aches and pains.</text><text>Younger children are usually given liquid medicines using teaspoons. For infants, the same medicine may be available in a more concentrated form (drops).</text></h2><h2 title="Use OTC Cold Medicines with Care"><text>OTC cold medicines may cause serious side-effects, including:</text><detail>Seizures</detail><detail>Rapid heart beat</detail><detail>Reduced consciousness</detail><detail>Reye syndrome (from aspirin)</detail><detail>Death </detail><text>Certain medicines should not be given to children, or only after a certain age.</text><detail>DO NOT give cold medicines to children less than 4 years old.</detail><detail>ONLY give cold medicines to children ages 4 to 6 years if your doctor recommends it.</detail><detail>DO NOT give ibuprofen to children younger than 6 months unless directed by a doctor.</detail><detail>DO NOT give aspirin if your child is younger than 12 to 14 years. </detail><text>Taking too many different medicines also may cause harm. Most OTC cold remedies contain more than one active ingredient.</text><detail>Avoid giving more than one OTC cold medicine to your child. It may cause an overdose with severe side effects.</detail><detail>Replacing one cold medicine with another may be ineffective or cause an overdose. </detail><text>Follow the dosage instructions strictly while giving an OTC medicine to your child.</text><text>When giving OTC cold medicines to your child:</text><detail>Ask yourself if your child really needs it - a cold will go away on its own without treatment.</detail><detail>Read the label. Check the active ingredients and strength.</detail><detail>Stick to the right dose -- less could be ineffective, more could be unsafe.</detail><detail>Follow instructions. Be sure you know how to give the medicine and how often to give it in a day.</detail><detail>Use the syringe or measuring cup provided with the liquid medicines. DO NOT use a household spoon.</detail><detail>If you have any questions or concerns, talk to your pharmacist or health care provider.</detail><detail>Never give OTC medicines to children less than 2 years old. </detail><text>You can also try some home care tips to help relieve cold symptoms in infants and younger children. </text><text>Store medicines in a cool, dry area.

<item><title>Cognitive behavioral therapy for back pain</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000415.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) can help many people deal with chronic pain.</text></h2><h2 title="What is CBT?"><text>CBT is a form of psychological therapy. It most often involves 10 to 20 meetings with a therapist. Focusing on your thoughts makes up the cognitive part of CBT. Focusing on your actions are the behavioral part.</text><text>First, your therapist helps you recognize the negative feelings and thoughts that occur when you have back pain. Then your therapist teaches you how to change those into helpful thoughts and healthy actions. Changing your thoughts from negative to positive can help you manage your pain.</text></h2><h2 title="How Does CBT Work?"><text>It is believed that changing your thoughts about pain can change how your body responds to pain.</text><text>You may not be able to stop physical pain from happening. But, with practice, you can control how your mind manages the pain. An example is changing a negative thought, such as "I cannot do anything anymore," to a more positive thought, such as "I dealt with this before and I can do it again."</text><text>A therapist using CBT will help you learn to:</text><detail>Identify negative thoughts</detail><detail>Stop negative thoughts</detail><detail>Practice using positive thoughts</detail><detail>Develop healthy thinking </detail><text>Healthy thinking involves positive thoughts and calming your mind and body by using techniques such as yoga, massage, or imagery. Healthy thinking makes you feel better, and feeling better reduces pain.</text><text>CBT can also teach you to become more active. This is important because regular, low-impact exercise, such as walking and swimming, can help reduce back pain over the long run.</text><text>For CBT to help reduce pain, your treatment goals need to be realistic and your treatment should be done in steps. For example, your goals may be to see friends more and start exercising. It is realistic to see one or two friends at first and take short walks, maybe just down the block. It is not realistic to reconnect with all of your friends all at once and walk 3 miles (5 kilometers) at once on your first outing. Exercise can help you to deal with chronic pain issues.</text></h2><h2 title="Getting Started"><text>Ask your health care provider for the names of a few therapists and see which ones are covered by your insurance.</text><text>Contact 2 to 3 of the therapists and interview them on the phone. Ask them about their experience with using CBT to manage chronic back pain. If you do not like the first therapist you speak to or see, try someone else.</text></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>Nonspecific back pain - cognitive behavioral; Backache - chronic - cognitive behavioral; Lumbar pain - chronic - cognitive behavioral; Pain - back - chronic - cognitive behavioral; Chronic back pain - low - cognitive behavioral</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 9/7/2017"><text>Updated by: C.

<item><title>Closed suction drain with bulb</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000039.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>A closed suction drain is placed under your skin during surgery. This drain removes any blood or other fluids that might build up in this area.</text></h2><h2 title="Why You Need This"><text>A closed suction drain is used to remove fluids that build up in areas of your body after surgery or when you have an infection. Although there is more than one brand of closed suction drains, this drain is often called a Jackson-Pratt, or JP, drain.</text><text>The drain is made up of two parts:</text><detail>A thin rubber tube</detail><detail>A soft, round squeeze bulb that looks like a grenade</detail><text>One end of the rubber tube is placed in the area of your body where fluid may build up. The other end comes out through a small incision (cut). A squeeze bulb is attached to this outer end.</text><text>Ask your health care provider when you may take a shower while you have this drain. You may be asked to take a sponge bath until the drain is removed.</text><text>There are many ways to wear the drain depending on where the drain comes out of your body.</text><detail>The squeeze bulb has a plastic loop that can be used to pin the bulb to your clothes.</detail><detail>If the drain is in your upper body, you can tie a cloth tape around your neck like a necklace and hang the bulb from the tape.</detail><detail>There are special garments, such as camisoles, belts, or shorts that have pockets or Velcro loops for the bulbs and openings for the tubes. Ask your provider what might be best for you. Health insurance may cover the cost of these garments, if you get a prescription from your provider.</detail></h2><h2 title="Emptying Your Drain"><text>Items you will need are:</text><detail>A measuring cup</detail><detail>A pen or pencil and a piece of paper</detail><text>Empty the drain before it gets full. You may need to empty your drain every few hours at first. As the amount of drainage decreases, you may be able to empty it once or twice a day:</text><detail>Get your measuring cup ready.</detail><detail>Clean your hands well with soap and water or with an alcohol-based cleanser. Dry your hands.</detail><detail>Open the bulb cap. DO NOT touch the inside of the cap. If you do touch it, clean it with alcohol.</detail><detail>Empty the fluid into the measuring cup.</detail><detail>Squeeze the JP bulb, and hold it flat.</detail><detail>While the bulb is squeezed flat, close the cap.</detail><detail>Flush the fluid down the toilet.</detail><detail>Wash your hands well.</detail><text>Write down the amount of fluid you drained out and the date and time each time you empty your JP drain.</text></h2><h2 title="Changing Your Dressing"><text>You might have a dressing around the drain where it comes out of your body. If you do not have a dressing, keep the skin around the drain clean and dry. If you are allowed to shower, clean the area with soapy water and pat it dry with a towel. If you are not allowed to shower, clean the area with a washcloth, cotton swabs, or gauze.</text><text>If you do have a dressing around the drain, you will need the following items:</text><detail>Two pairs of clean, unused, sterile medical gloves</detail><detail>Five or six cotton swabs</detail><detail>Gauze pads</detail><detail>Clean soapy water</detail><detail>Plastic trash bag</detail><detail>Surgical tape</detail><detail>Waterproof pad or bath towel </detail><text>To change your dressing:</text><detail>Wash your hands well with soap and water. Dry your hands.</detail><detail>Put on clean gloves.</detail><detail>Loosen the tape carefully and take off the old bandage. Throw the old bandage into the trash bag.</detail><detail>Look for any new redness, swelling, bad odor, or pus on the skin around the drain.</detail><detail>Use a cotton swab dipped in the soapy water to clean the skin around the drain. Do this 3 or 4 times, using a new swab each time.</detail><detail>Take off the first pair of gloves and throw them in the trash bag. Put on the second pair of gloves.</detail><detail>Put a new bandage around the drain tube site. Use surgical tape to hold it down against your skin.</detail><detail>Throw all used supplies in the trash bag.</detail><detail>Wash your hands again. </detail></h2><h2 title="Clogged Drain"><text>If there is no fluid draining into the bulb, there may be a clot or other material blocking the fluid. If you notice this:</text><detail>Wash your hands with soap and water. Dry your hands.</detail><detail>Gently squeeze the tubing where the clot is, to loosen it.</detail><detail>Grip the drain with the fingers of one hand, close to where it comes out of your body.</detail><detail>With the fingers of your other hand, squeeze down the length of the tube. Start where it comes out of your body and move toward the drainage bulb. This is called "stripping" the drain.</detail><detail>Release your fingers from the end of the drain where it comes out of your body and then release the end near the bulb.</detail><detail>You might find it easier to strip the drain if you put lotion or hand cleanser on your hands.</detail><detail>Do this several times until fluid is draining into the bulb.</detail><detail>Wash your hands again. </detail></h2><h2 title="When to Call the Doctor"><text>Call your doctor if:</text><detail>Stitches that hold the drain to your skin are coming loose or are missing.</detail><detail>The tube falls out.</detail><detail>Your temperature is 100.5°F (38.0°C) or higher.</detail><detail>Your skin is very red where the tube comes out (a small amount of redness is normal).</detail><detail>There is drainage from the skin around the tube site.</detail><detail>There is more tenderness and swelling at the drain site.</detail><detail>The drainage is cloudy or has a bad odor.</detail><detail>Drainage from the bulb increases for more than 2 days in a row.</detail><detail>The squeeze bulb will not stay collapsed.</detail><detail>The drainage stops suddenly when the drain has been steadily putting out fluid. </detail></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>Bulb drain; Jackson-Pratt drain; JP drain; Blake drain; Wound drain; Surgical drain</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 1/7/2018"><text>Updated by: Debra G.

It allows the bone to grow back together. It can be done by an orthopedic surgeon (bone doctor) or a primary care provider who has experience doing this procedure.</text><text>After the procedure, your broken limb will be placed in a cast.</text><text>Healing can take anywhere from 8 to 12 weeks. How quickly you heal will depend on:</text><detail>Your age</detail><detail>The size of the bone that broke</detail><detail>The type of break</detail><detail>Your general health </detail></h2><h2 title="Self-care at Home"><text>Rest your limb (arm or leg) as much as possible.

DO NOT hop on 1 leg. You can easily lose your balance and fall, causing more serious injury.</text></h2><h2 title="Cast Care"><text>General care guidelines for your cast include:</text><detail>Keep your cast dry.</detail><detail>DO NOT put anything inside your cast.</detail><detail>DO NOT put powder or lotion on your skin beneath your cast.</detail><detail>DO NOT remove the padding around the edges of your cast or break off part of your cast.</detail><detail>DO NOT scratch under your cast.</detail><detail>If your cast does get wet, use a hair dryer on the cool setting to help it dry.</detail><detail>DO NOT walk on your cast unless your provider tells you it is OK.

DO NOT take baths, soak in a hot tub, or go swimming until your provider tells you it is OK.</text></h2><h2 title="Follow-up"><text>You will likely have a follow-up visit with your provider 5 days to 2 weeks after your closed reduction.</text><text>Your provider may want you to start physical therapy or do other gentle movements while you heal. This will help keep your injured limb and other limbs from getting too weak or stiff.</text></h2><h2 title="When to Call the Doctor"><text>Call your provider if your cast:</text><detail>Feels too tight or too loose</detail><detail>Makes your skin itch, burn, or hurt in any way</detail><detail>Cracks or becomes soft</detail><text>Also call your provider if you have any signs of infection.

They may need to breathe through their mouths for the first week. There will be some drainage from their mouths and noses. The drainage should go away after about 1 week.</text></h2><h2 title="Incision Care"><text>Clean the incision (surgery wound) after feeding your child.</text><detail>Your health care provider may give you a special liquid for cleaning the wound.

When feeding, hold your infant in an upright position.</text><text>Use a cup or the side of a spoon for giving your child drinks. If you use a bottle, use only the kind of bottle and nipple that your doctor has recommended.</text><text>Older infants or young children will need to have their food softened or pureed for some time after surgery so it is easy to swallow. Use a blender or food processor to prepare food for your child.</text><text>Children who are eating foods other than breast milk or formula should be sitting when they eat. Feed them only with a spoon. DO NOT use forks, straws, chopsticks, or other utensils that can harm their incisions.</text><text>There are many good food choices for your child after surgery. Always make sure the food is cooked until it is soft, then pureed. Good food options include:</text><detail>Cooked meats, fish, or chicken.

Make sure they are smooth and thinner than normal.</detail><detail>Yogurt, pudding, or gelatin.</detail><detail>Small curd cottage cheese.</detail><detail>Formula or milk.</detail><detail>Creamy soups.</detail><detail>Cooked cereals and baby foods. </detail><text>Foods your child should NOT eat include:</text><detail>Seeds, nuts, bits of candy, chocolate chips, or granola (not plain, nor mixed into other foods)</detail><detail>Gum, jelly beans, hard candy, or suckers</detail><detail>Chunks of meat, fish, chicken, sausage, hot dogs, hard cooked eggs, fried vegetables, lettuce, fresh fruit, or solid pieces of canned fruit or vegetables</detail><detail>Peanut butter (not creamy or chunky)</detail><detail>Toasted bread, bagels, pastries, dry cereal, popcorn, pretzels, crackers, potato chips, cookies, or any other crunchy foods </detail></h2><h2 title="Activity"><text>Your child may play quietly. Avoid running and jumping until the provider says it is OK.</text><text>Your child may go home with arm cuffs or splints. These will keep your baby from rubbing or scratching the incision. Your child will need to wear the cuffs most of the time for about 2 weeks. Put on the cuffs over a long-sleeve shirt. Tape them to the shirt to keep them in place if needed.</text><detail>You may take the cuffs off 2 or 3 times a day. Take off only 1 at a time.</detail><detail>Move your child's arms and hands around, always holding on and keeping them from touching the incision.</detail><detail>Make sure there is no red skin or sores on your child's arms where the cuffs are placed.</detail><detail>Your child's provider will tell you when you can stop using the cuffs.</detail><text>Ask your provider when it is safe to go swimming. Children may have tubes in their eardrums and need to keep water out of their ears.</text></h2><h2 title="Follow-up Care"><text>Your provider will refer your child to a speech therapist.

A health care provider who provides chiropractic care is called a chiropractor.</text><text>Hands-on adjustment of the spine, called spinal manipulation, is the basis of chiropractic care. Most chiropractors also use other types of treatments as well.</text></h2><h2 title="What Happens During a Visit to a Chiropractor?"><text>The first visit most often lasts 30 to 60 minutes. Your chiropractor will ask about your goals for treatment and your health history. You will be asked about your:</text><detail>Past injuries and illnesses</detail><detail>Current health problems</detail><detail>Any medicines you are taking</detail><detail>Lifestyle</detail><detail>Diet</detail><detail>Sleep habits</detail><detail>Exercise</detail><detail>Mental stresses you might have</detail><detail>Use of alcohol, drugs, or tobacco </detail><text>Tell your chiropractor about any physical problems you may have that make it hard for you to do certain things. Also tell your chiropractor if you have any numbness, tingling, weakness, or any other nerve problems.</text><text>After asking you about your health, your chiropractor will do a physical exam. This will include testing your spinal mobility (how well your spine moves). Your chiropractor may also do some tests, such as checking your blood pressure and taking x-rays. These tests look for problems that might be adding to your back pain.</text><text>Treatment begins at the first or second visit in most cases.</text><detail>You may be asked to lie on a special table, where the chiropractor does the spinal manipulations.</detail><detail>The most common treatment is manipulation done by hand. It involves moving a joint in your spine to the end of its range, followed by a light thrust. This is often called an "adjustment." It realigns the bones of your spine to make them straighter.</detail><detail>The chiropractor may also do other treatments, like massage and other work on soft tissues. </detail><text>Some people are a little achy, stiff, and tired for a few days after their manipulations. This is because their bodies are adjusting to their new alignment. You should not feel any pain from the manipulation.</text></h2><h2 title="How Many Treatments Will You Need?"><text>More than one session is most often needed to correct a problem. Treatments generally last several weeks. Your chiropractor may suggest 2 or 3 short sessions a week at first. These would last only about 10 to 20 minutes each. Once you start improving, your treatments may be just once a week. You and your chiropractor will talk about how effective the treatment is based on the goals you discussed in your first session.</text></h2><h2 title="What Conditions Does Chiropractic Treat Best?"><text>Chiropractic treatment is most effective for:</text><detail>Subacute back pain (pain that has been present for 3 months or less)</detail><detail>Flare-ups of chronic (long-term) back pain</detail><detail>Neck pain </detail></h2><h2 title="Who Should Not Be Treated with Chiropractic?"><text>People should not have chiropractic treatment in the parts of their bodies that are affected by:</text><detail>Bone fractures or bone tumors</detail><detail>Severe arthritis</detail><detail>Bone or joint infections</detail><detail>Severe osteoporosis (thinning bones) </detail><detail>Severely pinched nerves</detail><text>Very rarely, manipulation of the neck may damage blood vessels or cause strokes. It is also very rare that manipulation may worsen a condition. But the screening process your chiropractor does at your first visit is meant to see if you might be at high risk for these problems. If you are, your chiropractor will not do neck manipulation.</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 9/7/2017"><text>Updated by: C.

It can also help relieve your child's anxiety, which can get in the way of treatment.</detail><detail>Many centers are able to help you find accommodations. That makes it easier to be close to your child during his or her treatment. </detail></h2><h2 title="Locating a Children's Cancer Center"><text>To locate a children's cancer center:</text><detail>Your health care provider can help you find centers in your area.</detail><detail>The American Childhood Cancer Organization has a directory that lists treatment centers by state.

To console your own child, learn the normal responses to grief that children have and the signs when your child is not coping well with grief.</text></h2><h2 title="How Children Think About Death Depends On How Old They Are"><text>It helps to understand how children think before talking to them about death. This is because you must speak to them on the subject at their own level.</text><detail>Infants and toddlers will be aware that people are sad. But they won't have any real understanding of death.</detail><detail>Preschool children think death is temporary and reversible. They may see death as simply a separation.</detail><detail>Children over 5 years old are beginning to understand that death lasts forever. But they think death is something that happens to others, not to themselves or their own families.</detail><detail>Teens understand that death is a stop of body functions and is permanent. </detail></h2><h2 title="What to Expect"><text>It is normal to grieve for the death of a close family member or friend. Expect your child to show a range of emotions and behaviors that can arise at unexpected times, such as:</text><detail>Sadness and crying.</detail><detail>Anger. Your child may explode in anger, play too rough, have nightmares, or fight with other family members. Understand that the child doesn't feel in control.</detail><detail>Acting younger. Many children will act younger, especially after a parent dies. They may want to be rocked, to sleep by an adult, or refuse to be left alone.</detail><detail>Asking the same question over and over. They ask because they don't quite believe that someone they love has died and they are trying to accept what has happened. </detail></h2><h2 title="What You Can Do"><text>Keep the following in mind:</text><detail>Don't lie about what is going on. Children are smart. They pick up on dishonesty and will wonder why you are lying.</detail><detail>Don't force children who are afraid to go to funerals. Find other ways for your children to remember and honor the deceased. For example, you can light a candle, pray, float a balloon to the sky, or look at photos.</detail><detail>Let your child's teachers know what has happened so the child can get support at school.</detail><detail>Give a lot of love and support to children as they grieve. Let them tell their stories and listen. This is one way for kids to deal with grief.</detail><detail>Give children time to grieve. Avoid telling children to return to normal activities without the time to grieve. This may cause emotional problems later.</detail><detail>Take care of your own grief. Your children look to you to understand how to handle grief and loss.</detail></h2><h2 title="When to Call the Doctor"><text>Ask your child's health care provider for help if you are worried about your child. Children may be having real problems with grief if they are:</text><detail>Denying that someone has died</detail><detail>Depressed and not interested in activities</detail><detail>Not playing with their friends</detail><detail>Refusing to be alone</detail><detail>Refusing to attend school or has a drop in school performance</detail><detail>Displaying changes in appetite</detail><detail>Having trouble sleeping</detail><detail>Continuing to act younger for a long time</detail><detail>Saying that they are going to join the dead person </detail></h2><h2 title="Review Date 5/20/2018"><text>Updated by: Neil K.

These vary by state. Most children grow big enough to move to a regular seat belt between 8 and 12 years old.</text><text>To keep your child safe, keep these tips in mind when using a car safety seat.</text><detail>When your child is born, you must have a car seat to bring the baby home from the hospital.</detail><detail>Always secure your child in a car seat whenever riding in a vehicle. Make sure the harness is fastened snugly.</detail><detail>Read the car seat manufacturer's instructions for the proper way to use the seat. Read your vehicle owner's manual, too.</detail><detail>Car seats and booster seats should always be used on the back seat of a vehicle. If there is no back seat, the car seat can be secured on the front passenger seat. This can ONLY be done when there is no front or side air bag, or the air bag has been switched off.</detail><detail>Even after children are big enough to wear a seat belt, riding in the back seat is safest. </detail><text>When you are selecting a child safety seat for the first time:</text><detail>The seat must fit your child's size and be able to be properly installed in your vehicle.</detail><detail>It is best to use a new car seat. Used car seats often do not have instructions. They may have cracks or other problems that make the seat unsafe. For example, the seat may have been damaged during a car accident.</detail><detail>Try the seat before buying it. Install the seat in your vehicle. Put your child in the car seat. Secure the harness and buckle. Check that the seat fits your vehicle and child.</detail><detail>DO NOT use a car seat past its expiration date. The seat frame may no longer be strong enough to support your child safely. The expiration date is usually on the bottom of the seat.</detail><detail>DO NOT use a seat that has been recalled. Fill out and send in the registration card that comes with the new car seat. The manufacturer can contact you if the seat is recalled. You can find out about recalls by contacting the manufacturer, or by looking up safety complaints records on your child's safety seat at www.safercar.gov/parents/CarSeats/Car-Seat-Safety.htm. </detail><text>The types of child safety seats and restraints include:</text><detail>Rear-facing seats</detail><detail>Forward-facing seats</detail><detail>Booster seats</detail><detail>Car beds</detail><detail>Built-in car seats</detail><detail>Travel vests </detail><text>REAR-FACING SEATS</text><text>A rear-facing seat is one in which your child faces the back of the vehicle. The seat should be installed in the back seat of your vehicle. The two types of rear-facing seats are the infant-only seat and the convertible seat.</text><text>Infant-only rear-facing seats. These seats are for babies who weigh up to 22 to 30 pounds (10 to 13.5 kilograms), depending on the car seat. You will need a new seat when your child gets bigger. Many children grow out of these seats by age 8 to 9 months. Infant-only seats have handles so you can carry the seat to and from the car. Some have a base you can leave installed in the car. This lets you click the car seat into place each time you use it. Follow manufacturer's instructions on how the seat should be reclined so your baby's head does not shift around while you are driving.</text><text>Convertible seats. These seats are to be placed in the rear-facing position and are for infants and toddlers. When your child is older and bigger, the seat can be switched to the forward-facing position. Experts recommend keeping your child rear-facing until at least age 3 and until your child outgrows the weight or height allowed by the seat.</text><text>FORWARD-FACING SEATS</text><text>A forward-facing seat should be installed on the back seat of your vehicle, although it allows your child to face the front of the car. These seats are used only after your child is too big for a rear-facing seat.</text><text>A combination forward-facing booster seat may also be used. For younger children, the booster seat's harness straps should be used. After your child reaches the upper height and weight limit for the harness (based on the seat's instructions), the vehicle's own lap and shoulder belts can be used to keep your child strapped in. </text><text>BOOSTER SEATS</text><text>A booster seat raises your child up so the vehicle's own lap and shoulder belts fit correctly. The lap belt should fall across your child's upper thighs. The shoulder belt should go across the middle of your child's shoulder and chest.</text><text>Use booster seats for older children until they are big enough to fit into a seat belt properly. The lap belt should fit low and tight across the upper thighs, and the shoulder belt should fit snug across the shoulder and chest and not cross the neck or face. A child's legs must be long enough so the feet can be flat on the floor. Most children can wear a seatbelt sometime between ages 8 and 12 years.</text><text>CAR BEDS</text><text>These seats are also called flat car seats. They are used for premature or other special-needs babies. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends having a health care provider look at how your preterm baby fits and breathes in a car seat before leaving the hospital.</text><text>BUILT-IN SEATS</text><text>Some vehicles have built-in car seats. Weight and height limits vary. You can get more details on these seats by reading the vehicle owner's manual or calling the vehicle manufacturer.</text><text>TRAVEL VESTS</text><text>Special vests can be worn by older children who have outgrown forward-facing safety seats. The vests can be used instead of booster seats. The vests are used with the vehicle's lap and seat belts. As with car seats, children should be sitting in the back seat when using the vest.</text></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>Child car seats; Infant car seats; Car seats; Car safety seats</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 2/16/2017"><text>Updated by: Neil K.

<item><title>Chikungunya virus</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000821.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>Chikungunya is a virus passed to humans by the bite of infected mosquitoes. Symptoms include fever and severe joint pain. The name chikungunya (pronounced "chik-en-gun-ye") is an African word meaning "bent over in pain." </text><text>For the most up-to-date information, please visit the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) website -- www.cdc.gov/chikungunya.</text></h2><h2 title="Information"><text>Where Chikungunya is Found</text><text>Before 2013, the virus was found in Africa, Asia, Europe, and the Indian and Pacific oceans. In late 2013, outbreaks occurred for the first time in the Americas in the Caribbean Islands. </text><text>In the Americas, local transmission of the disease has been found in 44 countries and territories. This means that mosquitoes in those areas have the virus and are spreading it to humans.</text><text>Since 2014, the disease has been found in travelers coming to the United States from affected areas in the Americas. Local transmission has occurred in Florida, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.</text><text>How Chikungunya Can Spread</text><text>Mosquitoes spread the virus to humans. Mosquitoes pick up the virus when they feed on infected people. They spread the virus when they bite other people. </text><text>The mosquitoes that spread chikungunya are the same type that spread dengue fever, which has similar symptoms. These mosquitoes most often feed on humans during the day.</text></h2><h2 title="Symptoms"><text>Symptoms develop 3 to 7 days after being bitten by an infected mosquito. The disease is easily spread. Most people who become infected have symptoms.</text><text>The most common symptoms are fever and joint pain. Other symptoms include:</text><detail>Headache</detail><detail>Joint swelling</detail><detail>Muscle pain</detail><detail>Nausea</detail><detail>Rash </detail><text>Symptoms are similar to the flu and can be severe, but usually not deadly. Most people recover in a week. Some have joint pain for months or longer. The disease can lead to death in frail older adults.</text></h2><h2 title="Treatment"><text>There is no treatment for chikungunya. Like the flu virus, it has to run its course. You can take steps to help relieve symptoms:</text><detail>Drink plenty of fluids to stay hydrated.</detail><detail>Get plenty of rest.</detail><detail>Take ibuprofen (Motrin, Advil), naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn), or acetaminophen (Tylenol) to relieve pain and fever.</detail></h2><h2 title="When to Contact a Medical Professional"><text>Call your health care provider if you develop symptoms of chikungunya. Let your provider know if you have traveled recently in an area where the virus is spread. Your provider may do a blood test to check for the disease.</text></h2><h2 title="Prevention"><text>There is no vaccine to protect against chikungunya. The best way to avoid getting the virus is to avoid getting bitten by mosquitoes. If you are in an area where there is local transmission of the virus, take these steps to protect yourself:</text><detail>When it is not too hot, cover up with long sleeves, long pants, socks, and a hat.</detail><detail>Use clothing coated with permethrin.</detail><detail>Use insect repellent with DEET, picaridin, IR3535, oil of lemon eucalyptus, or para-menthane-diol. When using sunscreen, apply insect repellant after you apply sunscreen.</detail><detail>Sleep in a room with air conditioning or with windows with screens. Check screens for large holes.</detail><detail>Remove standing water from any outside containers such as buckets, flower pots, and birdbaths.</detail><detail>If sleeping outside, sleep under a mosquito net.</detail><text>If you get chikungunya, try to avoid getting bitten by mosquitoes so you do not pass the virus to others.</text></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>Chikungunya virus infection; Chikungunya</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 5/18/2017"><text>Updated by: Jatin M.

This is because the virus or warts can also be on the nearby skin.</detail><detail>Have only one sexual partner, whom you know is infection-free.</detail><detail>Limit the number of sexual partners you have over time.</detail><detail>DO NOT get involved with partners who take part in high-risk sexual activities.</detail><detail>DO NOT smoke. Cigarette smoking increases the risk of getting cervical cancer. </detail></h2><h2 title="Pap Smears"><text>Cervical cancer often develops slowly. It starts as precancerous changes called dysplasia. Dysplasia can be detected by a medical test called a Pap smear.</text><text>Dysplasia is fully treatable. That is why it is important for women to get regular Pap smears, so that precancerous cells can be removed before they can become cancer.</text><text>Pap smear screening should start at age 21. After the first test:</text><detail>Women ages 21 through 29 should have a Pap smear every 3 years. HPV testing is not recommended for this age group.</detail><detail>Women ages 30 through 65 should be screened with either a Pap smear every 3 years or the HPV test every 5 years.</detail><detail>If you or your sexual partner has other new partners, you should have a Pap smear every 3 years.</detail><detail>Women ages 65 through 70 can stop having Pap smears as long as they have had 3 normal tests within the past 10 years.</detail><detail>Women who have been treated for precancer (cervical dysplasia) should continue to have Pap smears for 20 years after treatment or until age 65, whichever is longer. </detail><text>Talk with your provider about how often you should have a Pap smear or HPV test.</text></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>Cancer cervix - screening; HPV - cervical cancer screening; Dysplasia - cervical cancer screening; Cervical cancer - HPV vaccine</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 9/28/2017"><text>Updated by: John D.

The port and catheter are put in place in a minor surgery.</text><text>The catheter helps carry nutrients and medicine into your body. It will also be used to take blood when you need to have blood tests. Having a port attached to your catheter will cause less wear and tear on your veins than just having the catheter.</text></h2><h2 title="What is the Purpose of a Central Venous Catheter and Port?"><text>Catheters are used when you need medical treatment over a long period of time. For example, you may need:</text><detail>Antibiotics or other medicines for weeks to months</detail><detail>Extra nutrition because your bowels are not working correctly</detail><text>Or you may be receiving:</text><detail>Kidney dialysis several times a week</detail><detail>Cancer drugs often</detail><text>Your health care provider will talk with you about other methods for receiving medicine and fluids into a vein and will help you decide which one is best for you.</text></h2><h2 title="Placing the Port"><text>A port is placed under your skin in a minor surgery. Most ports are placed in the chest. But they may also be placed in the arm.</text><detail>You may be placed into a deep sleep so you do not feel pain during surgery.</detail><detail>You may stay awake and receive medicines to help you relax and numb the area so you do not feel pain. </detail><text>You can go home after your port is placed.</text><detail>You will be able to feel and see a quarter-sized bump under your skin where your port is.</detail><detail>You may be a little sore for a few days after surgery.</detail><detail>Once you have healed, your port should not hurt. </detail></h2><h2 title="Taking Care of and Using Your Port"><text>Your port has 3 parts.</text><detail>Portal or reservoir. A pouch made of hard metal or plastic.</detail><detail>Silicone top. Where a needle is inserted into the portal.</detail><detail>Tube or catheter. Carries medicine or blood from the portal to a large vein and into the heart. </detail><text>To get medicine or nutrition through your port, a trained provider will stick a special needle through your skin and the silicone top and into the portal. A numbing cream can be used on your skin to decrease the pain of the needle stick.</text><detail>Your port may be used in your home, in a clinic, or in the hospital.</detail><detail>A sterile dressing (bandage) will be placed around your port when it is used to help prevent infection. </detail><text>When your port is not being used, you can bathe or swim, as long as your doctor says you are ready for activity. Check with your provider if you plan to do any contact sports, such as soccer and football.</text><text>Nothing will stick out of your skin when your port is not being used. This decreases your chance of infection.</text><text>About once a month, you will need to have your port flushed to help prevent clots. To do this, your provider will use a special solution.</text><text>Ports can be used for a long time. When you no longer need your port, your provider will remove it.</text></h2><h2 title="When to Call the Doctor"><text>Tell your provider right away if you notice any signs of infection, such as:</text><detail>Your port seems to have moved.</detail><detail>Your port site is red, or there are red streaks around the site.</detail><detail>Your port site is swollen or warm.</detail><detail>Yellow or green drainage is coming from your port site.</detail><detail>You have pain or discomfort at the site.</detail><detail>You have a fever over 100.5°F (38.0°C).</detail></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>Central venous catheter - subcutaneous; Port-a-Cath; InfusaPort; PasPort; Subclavian port; Medi - port; Central venous line - port</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 5/12/2018"><text>Updated by: Laura J.

<item><title>Causes and risks for obesity in children</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000383.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>When children eat more than they need, their bodies store the extra calories in fat cells to use for energy later. If their bodies do not need this stored energy, they develop more fat cells and may become obese.</text><text>No single factor or behavior causes obesity. Obesity is caused by many things, including a person's habits, lifestyle, and environment. Genes and some medical problems also increase a person's chances of becoming obese.</text></h2><h2 title="Learned Behaviors and Habits"><text>Infants and young children are very good at listening to their bodies' signals of hunger and fullness. They will stop eating as soon as their bodies tell them they have had enough. But sometimes a well-meaning parent tells them they have to finish everything on their plate. This forces them to ignore their fullness and eat everything that is served to them.</text><text>The way we eat when we are children may strongly affect our eating behaviors as adults. When we repeat these behaviors over many years, they become habits. They affect what we eat, when we eat, and how much we eat.</text><text>Other learned behaviors include using food to:</text><detail>Reward good behaviors</detail><detail>Seek comfort when we feel sad</detail><detail>Express love </detail><text>These learned habits lead to eating no matter if we are hungry or full. Many people have a very hard time breaking these habits.</text></h2><h2 title="Lifestyle and Environment"><text>The family, friends, schools, and community resources in a child's environment reinforce lifestyle habits regarding diet and activity.</text><text>Children are surrounded by many things that make it easy to overeat and harder to be active:</text><detail>Parents have less time to plan and prepare healthy meals. As a result, children are eating more processed and fast foods that are usually less healthy than home-cooked meals.</detail><detail>Children see up to 10,000 food commercials every year. Most of these are for fast food, candy, soft drinks, and sugared cereals.</detail><detail>More foods today are processed and high in fat and contain too much sugar.</detail><detail>Vending machines and convenience stores make it easy to get a quick snack, but they rarely sell healthy foods.</detail><detail>Overeating is a habit that is reinforced by restaurants that advertise high-calorie foods and large portion sizes. </detail></h2><h2 title="At Home"><text>If a parent is overweight and has poor diet and exercise habits, the child is likely to adopt the same habits.</text><text>Screen time, such as watching television, gaming, texting, and playing on the computer are activities that require very little energy. They take up a lot of time and replace physical activity. And, when children watch TV, they often crave the unhealthy high-calorie snacks they see on commercials.</text></h2><h2 title="At School"><text>Schools have an important role in teaching students about healthy food choices and exercise. Many schools now limit unhealthy foods in lunches and vending machines. They are also encouraging students to exercise more.</text></h2><h2 title="In the Community"><text>Having a safe community that supports outdoor activities at parks, or indoor activities at community centers, is important for encouraging physical activity. If a parent feels it is not safe to allow their child to play outside, the child is more likely to do sedentary activities inside.</text></h2><h2 title="Eating Disorders and Obesity in Children"><text>The term eating disorders refers to a group of medical problems that have an unhealthy focus on eating, dieting, losing or gaining weight, and body image. Examples of eating disorders are: </text><detail>Anorexia</detail><detail>Bulimia</detail><text>Obesity and eating disorders often occur at the same time in teens and young adults who may be unhappy with their body image.</text></h2><h2 title="Genetic Factors"><text>Some children are at greater risk for obesity because of genetic factors. They have inherited genes from their parents that make their bodies gain weight easily. This would have been a very good trait hundreds of years ago, when food was hard to find and people were very active. Today, though, this can work against people who have these genes.</text><text>Genetics is not the only cause of obesity. To become obese, children must also eat more calories than they need for growth and energy.</text><text>Obesity may be linked to rare genetic conditions, such as Prader Willi syndrome.</text></h2><h2 title="Medical Factors"><text>Certain medical conditions can increase a child's appetite. These include hormone disorders or low thyroid function, and certain medicines, such as steroids or anti-seizure medicines. Over time, any of these can increase the risk for obesity.</text></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>Overweight in children - causes and risks</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 8/31/2016"><text>Updated by: Neil K.

You have one of these arteries on each side of your neck. Carotid artery surgery is a procedure to restore proper blood flow to the brain.</text></h2><h2 title="When You're in the Hospital"><text>You had carotid artery surgery to restore proper blood flow to your brain. Your surgeon made an incision (cut) in your neck over your carotid artery. A tube was put in place for blood to flow around the blocked area during your surgery. Your surgeon opened your carotid artery and carefully removed plaque from inside it. The surgeon may have placed a stent (a tiny wire mesh tube) in this area to help keep the artery open. Your artery was closed with stitches after the plaque was removed. The skin incision was closed with surgical tape.</text><text>During your surgery, your heart and brain activity were monitored closely.</text></h2><h2 title="What to Expect at Home"><text>You should be able to do most of your normal activities within 3 to 4 weeks. You may have a slight neck ache for about 2 weeks.</text><text>You may start doing everyday activities as soon as you feel up to it. You may need help with meals, taking care of the house, and shopping at first.</text><text>DO NOT drive until your incision is healed, and you can turn your head without discomfort.</text><text>You may have some numbness along your jaw and near your earlobe. This is from the incision. Most of the time, this goes away in 6 to 12 months.</text></h2><h2 title="Self-care"><detail>You may shower when you get home. It is ok if the surgical tape on your incision gets wet. DO NOT soak, scrub, or have shower water beat directly on the tape. The tape will curl up and fall off on its own after about a week.</detail><detail>Look carefully at your incision every day for any changes. DO NOT put lotion, cream, or herbal remedies on it without asking your health care provider first if it is ok.</detail><detail>Until the incision heals, DO NOT wear turtlenecks or other clothes around your neck that rub against the incision. </detail><text>Having carotid artery surgery does not cure the cause of the blockage in your arteries. Your arteries may become narrow again. To prevent this:</text><detail>Eat healthy foods, exercise (if your provider advises you to), stop smoking (if you smoke), and reduce your stress level.</detail><detail>Take medicine to help lower your cholesterol if your provider prescribes it.</detail><detail>If you are taking medicines for high blood pressure or diabetes, take them the way you have been told to take them.</detail><detail>You may be instructed to take aspirin and/or a medicine called clopidogrel (Plavix), or another medicine when you go home. These medicines keep your blood from forming clots in your arteries and in the stent. DO NOT stop taking them without talking with your provider first. </detail></h2><h2 title="When to Call the Doctor"><text>Call your health care provider if:</text><detail>You have a headache, become confused, or have numbness or weakness in any part of your body.</detail><detail>You have problems with your eyesight, you cannot talk normally, or you have trouble understanding what other people are saying.</detail><detail>You cannot move your tongue to the side of your mouth.</detail><detail>You have trouble swallowing.</detail><detail>You have chest pain, dizziness, or shortness of breath that does not go away with rest.</detail><detail>You are coughing up blood or yellow or green mucus.</detail><detail>You have chills or a fever over 101°F (38.3°C) or a fever that does not go away after you take acetaminophen (Tylenol).</detail><detail>Your incision becomes red or painful, or yellow or green discharge is draining from it.</detail><detail>Your legs are swelling. </detail></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>Carotid endarterectomy - discharge; CEA - discharge; Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty - carotid artery - discharge; PTA - carotid artery - discharge</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 2/23/2017"><text>Updated by: Amit M.

<item><title>Carotid artery stenosis - self-care</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000717.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>The carotid arteries provide the main blood supply to the brain. They are located on each side of your neck. You can feel their pulse under your jawline.</text><text>Carotid artery stenosis occurs when the carotid arteries become narrowed or blocked. This can lead to stroke.</text><text>Whether or not your doctor recommended surgery to unblock narrowed arteries, medicines and lifestyle changes can:</text><detail>Prevent further narrowing of these important arteries</detail><detail>Prevent a stroke from occurring </detail></h2><h2 title="Lifestyle Changes"><text>Making certain changes to your diet and exercise habits can help treat carotid artery disease. These healthy changes can also help you maintain a healthy weight and manage high blood pressure and cholesterol.</text><detail>Eat a healthy, low-fat diet.</detail><detail>Eat plenty of fruits and vegetables. Fresh or frozen are better choices than canned, which may have added salt or sugar.</detail><detail>Choose high-fiber foods, such as whole-grain breads, pastas, cereals, and crackers.</detail><detail>Eat lean meats and skinless chicken and turkey.</detail><detail>Eat fish twice a week. Fish is good for your arteries.</detail><detail>Cut back on saturated fat, cholesterol, and added salt and sugar. </detail><text>Be more active.</text><detail>Talk with your health care provider first to make sure you are healthy enough to exercise.</detail><detail>Walking is an easy way to add activity to your day. Start with 10 to 15 minutes a day.</detail><detail>Start gradually and build up to 150 minutes of exercise a week. </detail><text>Stop smoking, if you smoke. Quitting reduces your risk of stroke. Talk with your provider about quit-smoking programs.</text></h2><h2 title="Medicines"><text>If lifestyle changes do not lower your cholesterol and blood pressure enough, medicines may be prescribed.</text><detail>Cholesterol medicines help your liver produce less cholesterol. This prevents plaque, a waxy deposit, from building up in the carotid arteries.</detail><detail>Blood pressure medicines relax your blood vessels, make your heart beat slower, and help your body get rid of extra fluid. This helps lower high blood pressure.</detail><detail>Blood-thinning medicines, such as aspirin or clopidogrel, decrease the chance of blood clots forming and help lower your risk of stroke. </detail><text>These medicines can have side effects. If you notice side effects, be sure to tell your doctor. Your doctor may change the dose or type of medicine you take to help reduce side effects. Never stop taking medicines or take less medicine without talking to your provider first.</text></h2><h2 title="Follow-up Care"><text>Your provider will want to monitor you and see how well your treatment is working. At these visits, your provider may:</text><detail>Use a stethoscope to listen to the blood flow in your neck</detail><detail>Check your blood pressure</detail><detail>Check your cholesterol levels </detail><text>You may also have imaging tests done to see if the blockages in your carotid arteries are becoming worse.</text></h2><h2 title="When to Call the Doctor"><text>Having carotid artery disease puts you at risk for stroke. If you think you have symptoms of stroke, go to the emergency room or call your local emergency number (such as 9-1-1) immediately. Symptoms of a stroke include:</text><detail>Blurred vision</detail><detail>Confusion</detail><detail>Loss of memory</detail><detail>Loss of sensation</detail><detail>Problems with speech and language</detail><detail>Vision loss</detail><detail>Weakness in one part of your body </detail><text>Get help as soon as symptoms occur. The sooner you receive treatment, the better your chance for recovery. With a stroke, every second of delay can result in more brain injury.</text></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>Carotid artery disease - self-care</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 2/28/2018"><text>Updated by: Mary C.

Be sure to talk with each provider about the medicines being taken. Some interactions can cause unwanted or serious side-effects. These are the different interactions that can occur:</text><detail>Drug-drug interactions - Older people are more likely to have more harmful reactions between different medicines. For example, some interactions can cause sleepiness or increase the risk of falls. Others may interfere with how well the medicines work.</detail><detail>Drug-alcohol interactions - Older people may be more affected by alcohol. Mixing alcohol and medicines may cause a loss of memory or coordination or cause irritability. It can also increase the risk of falls.</detail><detail>Drug-food interactions - Certain foods can cause some medicines not to work as well. For example, you should avoid taking the blood thinner (anticoagulant) warfarin (Coumadin, Jantoven) with foods high in vitamin K, such as kale. </detail><text>Some medicines also may worsen certain health conditions in older adults. For example, NSAIDs may increase chance of fluid buildup and worsen heart failure symptoms.</text><text>TALK WITH THE LOCAL PHARMACIST</text><text>Get to know your local pharmacist. This person can help you keep track of the various medicines your loved one takes. They can also answer questions about side effects. Here are some tips for working with the pharmacist:</text><detail>Be sure to match the written prescription with the medicines you get from a pharmacy.</detail><detail>Ask for large print on the prescription packaging. This will make it easier for your loved one to see.</detail><detail>If there is medicine that can be split in two, the pharmacist can help you split tablets into the correct dosage.</detail><detail>If there are medicines that are difficult to swallow, ask the pharmacist for alternatives. They may be available in a liquid, suppository, or a skin patch. </detail><text>Of course, it can be easier and less expensive to get long-term medicines by mail order. Just be sure to print out the medication list from the provider web site before every doctor appointment.</text><text>ORGANIZING MEDICINES</text><text>With many medicines to keep track of, it's important to learn certain tricks to help you keep them organized:</text><detail>Keep an up-to-date list of all medicines and supplements and any allergies. Bring all of your medicines or a complete list to every doctor appointment and hospital visit.</detail><detail>Keep all medicines in a safe place.</detail><detail>Check 'the expiration' or 'use by' date of all medicines.</detail><detail>Keep all the medicines in original bottles. Use weekly pill organizers to keep track of what needs to be taken each day.</detail><detail>Devise a system to help you track when to give each medicine during the day. </detail><text>PLANNING AND ADMINISTERING THE MEDICINES PROPERLY</text><text>Simple steps that can help you to manage all medicines regularly include:</text><detail>Keep all medicines together in one place.</detail><detail>Use meal times and bedtimes as reminders to take medicines.</detail><detail>Use a watch alarm or notification on your mobile device for in-between medicines.</detail><detail>Read the instruction sheets properly before giving medicine in the form of eye-drops, inhaled medicines, or injections.</detail><detail>Be sure to dispose of any leftover medicines properly link to NEW article]. </detail></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>Caregiving - managing medicines</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 5/12/2018"><text>Updated by: Laura J.

<item><title>Cancer treatments</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000901.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>If you have cancer, your doctor will recommend one or more ways to treat the disease. The most common treatments are surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation. Other options include targeted therapy, immunotherapy, laser, hormonal therapy, and others. Here is an overview of the different treatments for cancer and how they work. </text><h3 title="Surgery"><text>Surgery is a common treatment for many types of cancer. During the operation, the surgeon takes out the mass of cancerous cells (tumor) and some of the nearby tissue. Sometimes, surgery is done to relieve side effects caused by a tumor. </text></h3><h3 title="Chemotherapy"><text>Chemotherapy refers to drugs used to kill cancer cells. The drugs may be given by mouth or into a blood vessel (IV). Different types of drugs may be given together at the same time or one after the other. </text></h3><h3 title="Radiation"><text>Radiation therapy uses x-rays, particles, or radioactive seeds to kill cancer cells. Cancer cells grow and divide faster than normal cells in the body. Because radiation is most harmful to quickly growing cells, radiation therapy damages cancer cells more than normal cells. This prevents the cancer cells from growing and dividing, and leads to cell death.</text><text>The two main types of radiation therapy are:</text><detail>External beam. This is the most common form. It aims x-rays or particles at the tumor from outside the body.</detail><detail>Internal beam. This form delivers radiation inside your body. It may be given by radioactive seeds placed into or near the tumor; a liquid or pill that you swallow; or through a vein (intravenous, or IV). </detail></h3><h3 title="Targeted Therapies"><text>Targeted therapy uses drugs to stop cancer from growing and spreading. It does this with less harm to normal cells than other treatments. </text><text>Standard chemotherapy works by killing cancer cells and some normal cells. Targeted treatment zeroes in on specific targets (molecules) in cancer cells. These targets play a role in how cancer cells grow and survive. Using these targets, the drug disables the cancer cells so they cannot spread. </text><text>Targeted therapy drugs work in a few different ways. They may:</text><detail>Turn off the process in cancer cells that causes them to grow and spread</detail><detail>Trigger cancer cells to die on their own</detail><detail>Kill cancer cells directly </detail><text>Targeted therapies are given as a pill or IV. </text></h3><h3 title="Immunotherapy"><text>Immunotherapy is a type of cancer treatment that relies on the body's ability to fight infection (immune system). It uses substances made by the body or in a lab to help the immune system work harder or in a more targeted way to fight cancer. This helps your body get rid of cancer cells. </text><text>Immunotherapy works by:</text><detail>Stopping or slowing the growth of cancer cells</detail><detail>Preventing cancer from spreading to other parts of the body</detail><detail>Boosting the immune system's ability to get rid of cancer cells </detail><text>These drugs are designed to seek and attack certain parts of a cancer cell. Some have toxins or radioactive substances attached to them. Immunotherapy is given by IV. </text></h3><h3 title="Hormonal Therapy"><text>Hormone therapy is used to treat cancers that are fueled by hormones, such as breast, prostate, and ovarian cancers. It uses surgery, or drugs to stop or block the body's natural hormones. This helps slow the growth of cancer cells. The surgery involves removing organs that make hormones: the ovaries or testes. The drugs are given by injection or as pills. </text></h3><h3 title="Hyperthermia"><text>Hyperthermia uses heat to damage and kill cancer cells without harming normal cells. </text><text>It may be used for:</text><detail>A small area of cells, such as a tumor</detail><detail>Parts of the body, such as an organ or limb</detail><detail>The whole body </detail><text>The heat is delivered from a machine outside the body or through a needle or probe placed in the tumor.</text></h3><h3 title="Laser Therapy"><text>Laser therapy uses a very narrow, focused beam of light to destroy cancer cells. Laser therapy can be used to:</text><detail>Destroy tumors and precancerous growths</detail><detail>Shrink tumors that are blocking the stomach, colon, or esophagus</detail><detail>Help treat cancer symptoms, such as bleeding</detail><detail>Seal nerve endings after surgery to reduce pain</detail><detail>Seal lymph vessels after surgery to reduce swelling and keep tumor cells from spreading </detail><text>Laser therapy is often given through a thin, lighted tube that is put inside the body. Thin fibers at the end of the tube direct the light at the cancer cells. Lasers are also used on the skin. </text><text>Lasers are most often used with other types of cancer treatment such as radiation and chemotherapy.</text></h3><h3 title="Photodynamic Therapy"><text>In photodynamic therapy, a person gets a shot of a drug that is sensitive to a special type of light. The drug stays in cancer cells longer than it stays in healthy cells. Then, the doctor directs light from a laser or other source at the cancer cells. The light changes the drug to a substance that kills the cancer cells. </text></h3><h3 title="Cryotherapy"><text>Also called cryosurgery, this therapy uses very cold gas to freeze and kill cancer cells. It is sometimes used to treat cells that might turn into cancer (called pre-cancerous cells) on the skin or cervix, for example. Doctors can also use a special instrument to deliver cryotherapy to tumors inside the body, such as the liver or prostate. </text></h3></h2><h2 title="Review Date 10/21/2017"><text>Updated by: Todd Gersten, MD, Hematology/Oncology, Florida Cancer Specialists &amp;amp; Research Institute, Wellington, FL.

<item><title>Cancer treatment: fertility and sexual side effects in women</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000840.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>Getting treatment for cancer can cause side effects. Some of these side effects can affect your sex life or fertility, which is your ability to have children. These side effects may last for a short time or be permanent. The type of side effect you have depends on your type of cancer and your treatment.</text></h2><h2 title="Cancers Most Likely to Have Sexual Side Effects"><text>Many cancer treatments can cause sexual side effects. But you are more likely to have these side effects if you are being treated for one of these types of cancer:</text><detail>Cervical cancer</detail><detail>Ovarian cancer</detail><detail>Colorectal cancer</detail><detail>Uterine cancer</detail><detail>Vaginal cancer</detail><detail>Breast cancer</detail><detail>Bladder cancer</detail></h2><h2 title="Types of Sexual Side Effects"><text>For women, the most common sexual side effects include:</text><detail>Loss of desire</detail><detail>Pain during sex</detail><text>Other side effects can include:</text><detail>Not being able to have an orgasm</detail><detail>Numbness or pain in the genitals</detail><detail>Problems with fertility</detail><text>Many people also have emotional side effects after cancer treatment, such as feeling depressed or bad about your body. These side effects can also affect your sex life. You may not feel like having sex or may not want your partner to touch your body. </text></h2><h2 title="How Cancer Treatment Causes These Side Effects"><text>Different types of cancer treatment can affect your sexuality and fertility in different ways. </text><text>Surgery for cancer:</text><detail>Pelvic surgery can cause pain and problems having sex or getting pregnant.</detail><detail>Some women who have surgery to remove all or part of a breast find they have less interest in sex.</detail><detail>The type of side effect you have depends on which part of the body where you have the surgery and how much tissue is removed. </detail><text>Chemotherapy can cause:</text><detail>Loss of sexual desire</detail><detail>Pain with sex and problems having an orgasm</detail><detail>Vaginal dryness and shrinking and thinning of the vaginal walls due to lower estrogen.</detail><detail>Problems with fertility </detail><text>Radiation therapy can cause:</text><detail>Loss of sexual desire</detail><detail>Changes in the lining of your vagina. This can cause pain and problems with fertility. </detail><text>Hormone therapy for breast cancer can cause:</text><detail>Loss of sexual desire</detail><detail>Vaginal pain or dryness</detail><detail>Trouble having an orgasm </detail></h2><h2 title="Talk About Side Effects"><text>One of the most important things you can do is to talk with your doctor about sexual side effects before your treatment. Ask what types of possible side effects to expect and how long they will last. This way, you will know what to expect. You should also talk about these changes with your partner. </text><text>If your treatment can cause fertility problems, you may want to see a fertility doctor before your treatment to discuss your options if you want to have children. These options may include freezing your eggs or ovarian tissue. </text></h2><h2 title="Sex During Treatment"><text>Although many women continue to have sex during cancer treatment, you may find you are not interested in sex. Both of these responses are normal. </text><text>If you do want to have sex, make sure to ask your doctor if it is OK. Also ask about using birth control. In many cases, it is not safe to get pregnant during cancer treatment. </text></h2><h2 title="Coping with Sexual Changes"><text>Sex may feel different for you after your treatment, but there are ways to help cope.</text><detail>Focus on the positive. Feeling bad about your body can affect your sex life. Look for little ways to give yourself a lift, such as a new hairstyle, new makeup or a new outfit.</detail><detail>Give yourself time. It can take months to heal after cancer treatment. Do not push yourself to have sex just because you think you should. Once you are ready, remember that it may take longer for you to feel aroused. You also may need to use a lubricant.</detail><detail>Keep an open mind. There is not just one way to have sex. Try to stay open to all ways of being intimate. Experiment with new ways of touching. You may find that what feels good after treatment is not the same as what felt good before treatment.</detail><detail>See your doctor. If you are having pain with sex, tell your doctor. You may be recommended creams, lubricants, or other treatments.</detail><detail>Talk with your partner. This is very important. Try to be open about your feelings. Be honest about what would make you feel good. And try to listen to your partner's concerns or desires with an open mind.</detail><detail>Share your feelings. It is normal to feel anger or grief after cancer treatment. Do not hold it in. Talk with close friends and family. It can also help to talk with a counselor if you cannot shake feelings of loss and grief.</detail></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>Radiotherapy - fertility; Radiation - fertility; Chemotherapy - fertility; Sexual dysfunction - cancer treatment</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 7/26/2018"><text>Updated by: Todd Gersten, MD, Hematology/Oncology, Florida Cancer Specialists &amp;amp; Research Institute, Wellington, FL.

Hot flashes are when your body suddenly feels hot. In some cases, hot flashes can make you sweat. Night sweats are hot flashes with sweating at night. </text><text>Hot flashes and night sweats are more common in women, but they can also occur in men. Some people continue to have these side effects after cancer treatment.</text><text>Hot flashes and night sweats can be unpleasant, but there are treatments that can help.</text></h2><h2 title="Causes"><text>People who are treated for breast cancer or prostate cancer are likely to have hot flashes and night sweats during or after treatment.</text><text>In women, some cancer treatments can cause them to go into early menopause. Hot flashes and night sweats are common symptoms of menopause. These treatments include some types of:</text><detail>Radiation</detail><detail>Chemotherapy</detail><detail>Hormone treatment</detail><detail>Surgery to remove your ovaries </detail><text>In men, surgery to remove one or both testicles or treatment with certain hormones can cause these symptoms.</text><text>Hot flashes and night sweats also may be caused by some medicines:</text><detail>Aromatase inhibitors. Used as hormone therapy for some women with certain types of breast cancer.</detail><detail>Opioids. Strong pain relievers given to some people with cancer.</detail><detail>Tamoxifen. A drug used to treat breast cancer in both women and men. It is also used to prevent cancer in some women.</detail><detail>Tricyclic antidepressants.

<item><title>Cancer treatment - preventing infection</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000913.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>When you have cancer, you may be at higher risk of infection. Some cancers and cancer treatments weaken your immune system. This makes it harder for your body to fight off germs, viruses, and bacteria. If you get an infection, it can quickly become serious and be hard to treat. In some cases, you may need to go to the hospital for treatment. So it is important to learn how to prevent and treat any infections before they spread.</text></h2><h2 title="How Having Cancer Increases Infection Risk"><text>As part of your immune system, your white blood cells help fight infection. White blood cells are made in your bone marrow. Some types of cancer, such as leukemia, and some treatments including bone marrow transplant and chemotherapy affect your bone marrow and immune system. This makes it harder for your body to make new white blood cells and increases your infection risk. </text><text>Your health care provider will check your white blood cell count during your treatment. When levels of certain white blood cells drop too low, it is called neutropenia. Often this is a short-lived side effect of cancer treatment. Your provider may give you medicines to help prevent infection if this occurs. But, you should also take some precautions.</text><text>Other risk factors for infection in people with cancer, include:</text><detail>Catheters</detail><detail>Medical conditions such as diabetes or COPD</detail><detail>Recent surgery</detail><detail>Malnutrition </detail></h2><h2 title="Ways to Prevent Infection"><text>There are many things you can do to help prevent infection. Here are some tips:</text><detail>Wash your hands often. Hand washing is very important after using the bathroom, before eating or cooking, after touching animals, and after blowing your nose or coughing. Carry hand sanitizer for times when you cannot wash.</detail><detail>Take care of your mouth. Brush your teeth often with a soft toothbrush and use a mouth rinse that does not contain alcohol.</detail><detail>Stay away from sick people. It is easy to catch a cold, the flu, chicken pox, or other infection from someone who has it. You should also avoid anyone who has had a live vaccine.</detail><detail>Clean yourself carefully after bowel movements. Use baby wipes or water instead of toilet paper and let your provider know if you have any bleeding or hemorrhoids.</detail><detail>Make sure your food and drinks are safe. DO NOT eat fish, eggs, or meat that is raw or undercooked. And DO NOT eat anything that is spoiled or past the freshness date.</detail><detail>Ask someone else to clean up after pets. DO NOT pick up pet waste or clean fish tanks or birdcages.</detail><detail>Carry sanitizing wipes. Use them before touching public surfaces such as doorknobs, ATM machines, and railings.</detail><detail>Guard against cuts. Use an electric razor to avoid nicking yourself while shaving and do not tear at nail cuticles. Also be careful when using knives, needles, and scissors. If you do get a cut, clean it right away with soap, warm water, and an antiseptic. Clean your cut this way every day until it forms a scab.</detail><detail>Use gloves when gardening. There are often bacteria in soil.</detail><detail>Stay away from crowds. Plan your outings and errands for times that are less crowded. Wear a mask when you have to be around lots of people.</detail><detail>Be gentle with your skin. Use a towel to gently pat dry your skin after a shower or bath, and use lotion to keep it soft. DO NOT pick at pimples or other spots on your skin.</detail><detail>Ask about getting a flu shot. DO NOT get any vaccines without first talking to your provider. You should NOT receive any vaccines that contain a live virus.</detail><detail>Skip the nail salon and care for your nails at home. Make sure you use tools that have been cleaned well. </detail></h2><h2 title="Know How to Spot an Infection"><text>It is important to know the symptoms of an infection so you can call your provider right away. They include:</text><detail>A fever of 100.4°F (38°C) or higher</detail><detail>Chills or sweats</detail><detail>Redness or swelling anywhere on your body</detail><detail>Cough</detail><detail>Earache</detail><detail>Headache, stiff neck</detail><detail>Sore throat</detail><detail>Sores in your mouth or on your tongue</detail><detail>Rash</detail><detail>Bloody or cloudy urine</detail><detail>Pain or burning with urination</detail><detail>Nasal congestion, sinus pressure or pain</detail><detail>Vomiting or diarrhea</detail><detail>Pain in your stomach or rectum </detail><text>DO NOT take acetaminophen, aspirin, ibuprofen, naproxen, or any medicine that may reduce a fever without first talking with your provider.</text></h2><h2 title="When to Call Your Doctor"><text>During or right after cancer treatment, call your provider right away if you have any of the signs of infection mentioned above. Getting an infection during cancer treatment is an emergency.</text><text>If you go to an emergency room, tell the staff right away that you have cancer. You shouldn't sit in the waiting room a long time because you may catch an infection.</text></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>Chemotherapy - preventing infection; Radiation - preventing infection; Bone marrow transplant - preventing infection; Cancer treatment - immunosuppression</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 12/10/2016"><text>Updated by: Linda J.

<item><title>Cancer treatment - early menopause</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000912.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>Certain types of cancer treatments can cause women to have early menopause. This is menopause that occurs before age 40. It happens when your ovaries stop working and you no longer have periods or cannot get pregnant. </text><text>Early menopause can cause symptoms such as hot flashes and vaginal dryness. Your health care provider can help you find treatments for these symptoms.</text></h2><h2 title="Treatments That can Cause Early Menopause"><text>Cancer treatments that can cause early menopause include:</text><detail>Surgery. Having both ovaries removed causes menopause to happen right away. If you are age 50 or younger, your provider may try to leave an ovary or part of an ovary if possible. This can keep you from having early menopause.</detail><detail>Chemotherapy (chemo). Some types of chemo can damage your ovaries and cause early menopause. You may have menopause right away or months after treatment. Your risk of early menopause from chemo depends on the type and amount of chemo drug you have. The younger you are, the less likely you will have early menopause from chemo.</detail><detail>Radiation. Getting radiation in your pelvic area can also damage your ovaries. In some cases, your ovaries may heal and start working again. But, if you get large doses of radiation, the damage may be permanent.</detail><detail>Hormone therapy. These treatments used to treat breast and uterine cancers can often cause early menopause. </detail><text>Ask your provider if your cancer treatment may cause early menopause.</text></h2><h2 title="Effects of Early Menopause"><text>When your ovaries are removed or stop working, they no longer make estrogen. This causes the same symptoms as natural menopause.</text><detail>Vaginal dryness or tightness</detail><detail>Hot flashes</detail><detail>Mood changes</detail><detail>Lower sex drive</detail><detail>Problems sleeping </detail><text>In some cases, these symptoms may come on strong and can be severe.</text><text>Less estrogen in your body also increases your risk for certain health conditions, such as:</text><detail>Heart disease</detail><detail>Osteoporosis (thinning of bones) </detail></h2><h2 title="How to Ease Symptoms"><text>Many treatments can help ease the symptoms of early menopause. They include medicines and lifestyle treatments you can do at home. </text><text>Some medicines that may help include:</text><detail>Hormone therapy. In some cases, your provider may prescribe female hormones to help with hot flashes and other symptoms. But, there are some risks with hormones, and you may not be able to take them if you have had certain types of cancer.</detail><detail>Vaginal estrogen. Even if you cannot take hormone therapy, you may be able to use small amounts of estrogen in or around your vagina to help with dryness. These hormones come in creams, gels, tablets, and rings. You need a prescription from your provider for these medicines.</detail><detail>Antidepressants or other medicines. If you cannot take hormones, your provider may prescribe another type of medicine to help with hot flashes, such as certain antidepressants.</detail><detail>Lubricants or moisturizers. These products can help make sex more comfortable if you have vaginal dryness. Look for a water-based lubricant, such as K-Y Jelly or Astroglide. Or, try using a vaginal moisturizer like Replens every few days.</detail><detail>Medicines for bone loss. Some women take medicines to help reduce bone loss after menopause. Ask your provider if this type of medicine may be right for you. </detail><text>Treatments you can try at home include:</text><detail>Staying active. Getting regular exercise can help with mood swings, sleep problems, and mild hot flashes.</detail><detail>Healthy sleep habits. Getting enough sleep may help ease mood swings. But, if you are having trouble sleeping at night, try skipping naps during the day. You should also avoid caffeine late in the day, and do not have large meals or do anything too active right before bedtime.</detail><detail>Dressing in layers. This can help with hot flashes, since you can remove layers when you feel hot. It can also help to dress in loose, cotton clothing. </detail><text>Ask your provider what treatments might work best for you. </text></h2><h2 title="Protecting Your Bones and Heart"><text>Since early menopause can affect your bone and heart health, it's important to take steps to keep them healthy. Here is how:</text><detail>Eat healthy foods. Focus on fresh fruits and vegetables, whole grains, lean meats, fish, nuts, beans, and low-fat dairy products.</detail><detail>Get enough calcium and vitamin D. These nutrients help build bones. Foods rich in calcium include fat-free yogurt and milk, spinach, and white beans. Your body makes most of its vitamin D from the sun, but you can also get it from salmon, eggs, and milk that has vitamin D added. Ask your provider if you need to take supplements.</detail><detail>Get exercise. The best kinds of exercise for your bones are weight-bearing exercises that work your body against gravity. Some ideas include walking, yoga, hiking, dancing, lifting weights, gardening, and tennis.</detail><detail>DO NOT smoke. Smoking raises your risk for both osteoporosis and heart disease. If you need help quitting, ask your provider.</detail><detail>Ask about a bone density test. This is a test that checks for osteoporosis. Most women have this test after age 65, but you may need one earlier if you have early menopause.</detail><detail>Keep track of your numbers. Make sure your provider checks your blood pressure, cholesterol, and blood sugar levels regularly. These simple tests can help tell you if you are at risk for heart disease or stroke. </detail></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>Premature menopause; Ovarian insufficiency - cancer</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 12/10/2016"><text>Updated by: Linda J.

<item><title>Cancer treatment - dealing with pain</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000827.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>Cancer can sometimes cause pain. This pain can come from the cancer itself, or from the treatments for cancer. </text><text>Treating your pain should be part of your overall treatment for cancer. You have a right to receive treatment for cancer pain. There are many medicines and other treatments that can help. If you have any pain, be sure to talk with your health care provider about your options. </text></h2><h2 title="What Causes Pain"><text>The pain from cancer can have a few different causes:</text><detail>The cancer. When a tumor grows it can press on nerves, bones, organs, or the spinal cord, causing pain.</detail><detail>Medical tests. Some medical tests, such as a biopsy or bone marrow test, can cause pain.</detail><detail>Treatment. Many types of cancer treatments can cause pain, including chemotherapy, radiation, and surgery. </detail><text>Everyone's pain is different. Your pain can range from mild to severe and may last for only a short time or continue for a long time. </text></h2><h2 title="Why Treat Pain"><text>Many people with cancer do not get enough treatment for their pain. This may be because they do not want to take pain medicine, or they do not think it will help. But treating your pain is part of treating your cancer. You should get treatment for pain just as you would for any other side effect. </text><text>Managing pain can also help you feel better overall. Treatment can help you:</text><detail>Sleep better</detail><detail>Be more active</detail><detail>Want to eat</detail><detail>Feel less stress and depression</detail><detail>Improve your sex life </detail></h2><h2 title="Addiction Concerns"><text>Some people are afraid to take pain medicines because they think they will become addicted. Over time, your body may develop a tolerance for pain medicine. This means that you may need more of it to treat your pain. This is normal and can happen with other medicines as well. It does not mean you are addicted. As long as you are taking the medicine as prescribed by your doctor, you have little chance of becoming addicted. </text></h2><h2 title="How to Talk About Pain"><text>To make sure you get the right treatment for your pain, it is important to be as honest as possible with your provider. You will want to tell your provider:</text><detail>What your pain feels like (aching, dull, throbbing, constant, or sharp)</detail><detail>Where you feel the pain</detail><detail>How long the pain lasts</detail><detail>How strong it is</detail><detail>If there is a time of day it feels better or worse</detail><detail>If there is anything else that makes it feel better or worse</detail><detail>If your pain keeps you from doing any activities </detail><text>Your provider may ask you to rate your pain using a scale or a chart. It may be helpful to keep a pain diary to help track your pain. You can also keep track of when you take medicine for your pain and how much it helps. This will help your provider know how well the medicine is working.</text></h2><h2 title="Types of Medicines for Pain"><text>There are three main types of medicines for cancer pain. Your provider will work with you to find a medicine that works best for you with the least amount of side effects. In general, you will start with the least amount of medicine with the fewest side effects that relieves your pain. If one medicine does not work, your provider may suggest another. It may take a little time to find the right medicine and the right dose that is right for you.</text><detail>Non-opioid pain relievers. These medicines include acetaminophen (Tylenol) and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin, others), and naproxen (Aleve). They are best to treat mild to moderate pain. You can buy most of these medicines over the counter.</detail><detail>Opioids or narcotics. These are stronger medicines that are used to treat moderate to severe pain. You need to have a prescription to take them. Some common opioids include codeine, fentanyl, morphine, and oxycodone. You may take these medicines in addition to other pain relievers.</detail><detail>Other types of medicines. Your provider may prescribe other medicines to help with your pain. These can include anticonvulsants or antidepressants for nerve pain or steroids to treat pain from swelling. </detail></h2><h2 title="How to Take Pain Medicine"><text>It is important to take your pain medicine exactly as your provider tells you to. Here are some tips to get the most out of your pain medicine:</text><detail>Tell your provider about all other medicines you are taking. Some pain medicines can interact with other medicines.</detail><detail>DO NOT skip doses or try to go longer between doses. Pain is easiest to treat when you treat it early. DO NOT wait until pain is severe before taking your medicine. This may make your pain harder to treat and cause you to need larger doses.</detail><detail>DO NOT stop taking the medicine on your own. Tell your provider if you have side effects or other issues. Your provider can help you find ways to deal with side effects or other problems. If the side effects are too severe, you may need to try another medicine.</detail><detail>Tell your provider if the medicine is not working. They may increase your dose, have you take it more often, or try another medicine. </detail></h2><h2 title="Other Treatments for Cancer Pain"><text>In some cases, your provider may suggest another type of treatment for your cancer pain. Some options include:</text><detail>Transcutaneous electric nerve stimulation (TENS). TENS is a mild electrical current that can help ease pain. You place it on the part of your body where you feel pain.</detail><detail>Nerve block. This is a special type of pain medicine injected around or into a nerve to ease pain.</detail><detail>Radiofrequency ablation. Radio waves heat up regions of nerve tissue to help ease pain.</detail><detail>Radiation therapy. This treatment can shrink a tumor that is causing pain.</detail><detail>Chemotherapy. These medicines can also shrink a tumor to reduce pain.</detail><detail>Surgery. Your provider may use surgery to remove a tumor that is causing pain. In some cases, a type of brain surgery can cut the nerves that carry pain messages to your brain.</detail><detail>Complementary or alternative treatments. You may also choose to try treatments such as acupuncture, chiropractic, meditation, or biofeedback to help treat your pain. In most cases, people use these methods in addition to medicines or other types of pain relief. </detail></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>Palliative - cancer pain</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 7/26/2018"><text>Updated by: Todd Gersten, MD, Hematology/Oncology, Florida Cancer Specialists &amp;amp; Research Institute, Wellington, FL.

<item><title>Cancer prevention: take charge of your lifestyle</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000825.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>Like any illness or disease, cancer can occur without warning. Many factors that increase your cancer risk are beyond your control, such as your family history and your genes. Others, such as whether you smoke or get regular cancer screenings, are within your control. </text><text>Changing certain habits can give you a powerful tool to help prevent cancer. It all starts with your lifestyle.</text></h2><h2 title="Quit Smoking and Using Tobacco"><text>Quitting smoking has a direct effect on your risk of cancer. Tobacco contains harmful chemicals that damage your cells and cause cancer growth. Harming your lungs is not the only concern. Smoking and tobacco use cause many types of cancer, such as:</text><detail>Lung</detail><detail>Throat</detail><detail>Mouth</detail><detail>Esophagus</detail><detail>Bladder</detail><detail>Kidney</detail><detail>Pancreatic</detail><detail>Certain leukemias</detail><detail>Stomach </detail><detail>Colon</detail><detail>Rectum</detail><detail>Cervix</detail><text>Tobacco leaves and the chemicals added to them are not safe. Smoking tobacco in cigarettes, cigars, and pipes, or chewing tobacco can all give you cancer.</text><text>If you smoke, talk with your health care provider today about ways to quit smoking and all tobacco use. </text></h2><h2 title="Protect Yourself from UV Rays"><text>The ultraviolet radiation in sunlight can cause changes to your skin. The sun's rays (UVA and UVB) damage skin cells. These harmful rays are also found in tanning beds and sunlamps. Sunburns and many years of sun exposure can lead to skin cancer.</text><text>It is unclear whether avoiding the sun or using sunscreen can prevent all skin cancers. Still, you are better off protecting yourself from UV rays:</text><detail>Stay in the shade.</detail><detail>Cover up with protective clothing, a hat, and sunglasses.</detail><detail>Apply sunscreen 15 to 30 minutes before going outside. Use SPF 30 or higher and reapply every 2 hours if you will be swimming, sweating, or outside in direct sun for a long time.</detail><detail>Avoid tanning beds and sun lamps. </detail></h2><h2 title="Maintain a Healthy Weight"><text>Carrying a lot of extra weight creates changes in your hormones. These changes can trigger cancer growth. Being overweight (obese) puts you at higher risk for:</text><detail>Breast cancer (after menopause)</detail><detail>Colon cancer</detail><detail>Endometrial cancer</detail><detail>Kidney cancer</detail><detail>Pancreatic cancer</detail><detail>Esophageal cancer</detail><detail>Thyroid cancer</detail><detail>Gallbladder cancer </detail><text>Your risk is higher if your body mass index (BMI) is high enough to be considered obese. You can use an online tool to calculate your BMI at www.cdc.gov/healthyweight/assessing/index.html. You can also measure your waist to see where you stand. In general, a woman with a waist over 35 inches (89 centimeters) or a man with a waist over 40 inches (102 centimeters) is at increased risk for health problems from obesity.</text><text>Exercise regularly and eat healthy foods to keep your weight in check. Ask your provider for advice on how to lose weight safely.</text></h2><h2 title="Get Regular Exercise"><text>Exercise is healthy for all, for many reasons. Studies have shown that people who exercise seem to have a lower risk for certain cancers. Exercise can help you keep your weight down. Staying active may help protect you against colon, breast, lung, and endometrial cancers. </text><text>According to national guidelines, you should exercise for 2 hours and 30 minutes per week for health benefits. That is 30 minutes at least 5 days per week. Doing more is even better for your health.</text></h2><h2 title="Eat Healthy Foods"><text>Good food choices can build up your immune system and may help protect you from cancer. Take these steps:</text><detail>Eat more plant-based foods like fruits, beans, legumes, and green vegetables</detail><detail>Drink water and low-sugar drinks</detail><detail>Avoid processed foods from boxes and cans</detail><detail>Avoid processed meats like hotdogs, bacon, and deli meats</detail><detail>Choose lean proteins such as fish and chicken; limit red meat</detail><detail>Eat whole grain cereals, pasta, crackers, and breads</detail><detail>Limit high-calorie fattening foods, such as French fries, doughnuts, and fast foods</detail><detail>Limit candy, baked goods, and other sweets</detail><detail>Consume smaller portions of foods and drinks</detail><detail>Prepare most of your own foods at home, rather than buying pre-made or eating out</detail><detail>Prepare foods by baking rather than broiling or grilling; avoid heavy sauces and creams </detail><text>Stay informed. The chemicals and added sweeteners in certain foods are being looked at for their possible links to cancer.</text></h2><h2 title="Limit Alcohol"><text>When you drink alcohol, your body has to break it down. During this process, a chemical byproduct is left in the body that can damage cells. Too much alcohol may also get in the way of healthy nutrients your body needs.</text><text>Drinking too much alcohol is linked to the following cancers:</text><detail>Oral cancer</detail><detail>Esophageal cancer</detail><detail>Breast cancer</detail><detail>Colorectal cancer</detail><detail>Liver cancer</detail><text>Limit your alcohol to 2 drinks per day for men and 1 drink per day for women or none at all.</text></h2><h2 title="Have Regular Check-ups"><text>Your provider can help you assess your risk for cancer and steps you can take. Visit your provider for a physical exam. That way you stay on top of what cancer screenings you should have. Screening can help to detect cancer early and improve your chance of recovery. </text><text>Some infections can also cause cancer. Talk with your provider about whether you should have these vaccinations:</text><detail>Human papillomavirus (HPV). The virus increases the risk for cancers of the cervix, penis, vagina, vulvar, anus, and throat.</detail><detail>Hepatitis B. Hepatitis B infection increases the risk for liver cancer. </detail></h2><h2 title="When to Call the Doctor"><text>Call your provider if:</text><detail>You have questions or concerns about your cancer risk and what you can do</detail><detail>You are due for a cancer screening test </detail></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>Lifestyle modification - cancer</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 7/26/2018"><text>Updated by: Todd Gersten, MD, Hematology/Oncology, Florida Cancer Specialists &amp;amp; Research Institute, Wellington, FL.

<item><title>Cancer and lymph nodes</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000824.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>Lymph nodes are part of the lymph system, a network of organs, nodes, ducts, and vessels that support the body's immune system. </text><text>Nodes are little filters throughout the body. The cells in lymph nodes help to destroy infection, such as from a virus, or harmful cells, such as cancer cells. </text><text>Cancer can spread or start in lymph nodes.</text></h2><h2 title="How Cancer Gets in the Lymph Nodes"><text>Cancer can start in the lymph nodes. This is called lymphoma. There are several types of lymphomas, such as non-Hodgkin lymphoma.</text><text>Cancer cells can also spread to the lymph nodes from a cancer in any part of the body. This is called metastatic cancer. Cancer cells break off from a tumor in the body and travel to an area of lymph nodes. The cancer cells often travel to nodes near the tumor first. </text></h2><h2 title="How Cancer in Lymph Nodes is Found"><text>Nodes swell as they work hard to fight cancer cells.</text><text>You or your health care provider may feel or see swollen lymph nodes if they are close to the surface of the skin, such as in the neck, groin, or underarms.</text><text>Keep in mind that many other things also can cause lymph nodes to swell. So having swollen lymph nodes does not mean you definitely have cancer.</text><text>When a provider suspects that cancer cells may be present in lymph nodes, certain tests may be performed to detect cancer, such as:</text><detail>Lymph node biopsy</detail><detail>B-cell leukemia/lymphoma panel</detail><detail>Other imaging tests </detail></h2><h2 title="What it Means When Cancer is Found"><text>A node can have a small or large amount of cancer cells in it. There are hundreds of nodes throughout the body. Several clusters or only a few nodes may be affected. Nodes near or far from the primary tumor may be affected.</text><text>The location, amount of swelling, number of cancer cells, and number of nodes affected will help determine the treatment plan. When cancer has spread to lymph nodes, it is in a more advanced stage.</text><text>The cancer in lymph nodes can be treated with:</text><detail>Surgery</detail><detail>Chemotherapy</detail><detail>Radiation</detail></h2><h2 title="Removing Lymph Nodes"><text>Surgical removal of lymph nodes is called lymphadenectomy. Surgery can help to get rid of the cancer before spreading further.</text><text>After nodes are removed, fluid has fewer places to go. Sometimes back up of lymph fluid, or lymphedema, can occur.</text></h2><h2 title="When to Call the Doctor"><text>Call your provider if you have questions or concerns about swollen lymph nodes or your cancer treatment.</text></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>Lymph gland</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 8/15/2016"><text>Updated by: Todd Gersten, MD, Hematology/Oncology, Florida Cancer Specialists &amp;amp; Research Institute, Wellington, FL.

<item><title>Calorie count - Alcoholic beverages</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000886.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>Alcoholic drinks, like many other drinks, contain calories that can add up quickly. Going out for a couple of drinks can add 500 calories, or more, to your daily intake. Most alcoholic drinks have little to no nutritional value. If you are trying to lose weight or maintain a healthy weight, you will want to watch how much you drink. Cocktails mixed with soda, juice, cream, or ice cream can have especially high calorie counts. If you find you are having trouble cutting back on alcohol, talk with your health care provider. </text><text>Here is a list of some popular alcoholic beverages, their serving sizes, and the number of calories in each.</text>&lt;table border="1" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"&gt;&lt;caption&gt;Calorie count - alcoholic beverages&lt;/caption&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th valign="top" scope="col"&gt;BEVERAGE&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th valign="top" scope="col"&gt;SERVING SIZE&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th valign="top" scope="col"&gt;CALORIES&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th valign="top" scope="row"&gt;Beer&lt;/th&gt;&lt;td valign="top"&gt;

Low bone density can cause your bones to become brittle and fragile. These weak bones can break more easily, even without an obvious injury.</text><text>Vitamin D helps your body absorb calcium. Eat foods that provide the right amounts of calcium, vitamin D, and protein. This kind of diet will give your body the building blocks it needs to make and maintain strong bones.</text><text>In addition to getting enough calcium and vitamin D, you can reduce your risk of developing osteoporosis by exercising regularly and avoiding smoking and excessive alcohol use.</text></h2><h2 title="How Much Calcium and Vitamin D do I Need?"><text>Amounts of calcium are given in milligrams (mg), and vitamin D is given in international units (IU).</text><text>All children ages 9 to 18 should have:</text><detail>1300 mg of calcium daily</detail><detail>600 IU of vitamin D daily</detail><text>All adults under age 50 should have:</text><detail>1000 mg of calcium daily</detail><detail>400 to 800 IU of vitamin D daily</detail><text>Adults age 51 and older should have:</text><detail>Women: 1200 mg of calcium daily</detail><detail>Men: 1000 mg of calcium daily</detail><text>Men and women: 800 to 1000 IU of vitamin D daily</text><text>Too much calcium or vitamin D can lead to problems such as an increased risk for kidney stones.</text><detail>Total calcium should not exceed 2000 mg per day</detail><detail>Total vitamin D should not exceed 4000 IU per day</detail><picname>Calcium source</picname><picurl>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/images/ency/fullsize/18122.jpg</picurl></h2><h2 title="Calcium and Dairy Products"><text>Milk and dairy products are the best sources of calcium. They contain a form of calcium that your body can absorb easily. Choose yogurts, cheeses, and buttermilk.</text><text>Adults should choose fat-free (skim) milk or low-fat (2% or 1%) milk, and other lower fat dairy products. Removing some of the fat does not lower the amount of calcium in a dairy product.</text><detail>Yogurt, most cheeses, and buttermilk come in fat-free or low-fat versions.</detail><detail>Vitamin D helps your body use calcium, which is why vitamin D is often added to milk. </detail><text>If you eat very few or no dairy products, you can find calcium in other foods. It is often added to orange juice, soy milk, tofu, ready-to-eat cereals, and breads. Check the labels on these foods for added calcium.</text></h2><h2 title="Other Sources of Calcium "><text>Green leafy vegetables, such as broccoli, collards, kale, mustard greens, turnip greens, and bok choy (Chinese cabbage), are good sources of calcium.</text><text>Other good food sources of calcium are: </text><detail>Salmon and sardines that are canned with their bones (you can eat these soft bones)</detail><detail>Almonds, Brazil nuts, sunflower seeds, tahini (sesame paste), and dried beans</detail><detail>Blackstrap molasses </detail><text>Other tips to make sure your body can use the calcium in your diet:</text><detail>Cook high-calcium vegetables in a small amount of water for the shortest possible time. They will retain more calcium this way.</detail><detail>Be careful about what you eat with calcium-rich foods. Certain fibers, such as wheat bran and foods with oxalic acid (spinach and rhubarb), can prevent your body from absorbing calcium. </detail><text>Your doctor may recommend a calcium or vitamin D supplement for the calcium and vitamin D you need. However, the balance between benefits and harms of these supplements is unclear.</text></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>Osteoporosis - calcium; Osteoporosis - low bone density</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 4/12/2018"><text>Updated by: Gordon A.

Make sure you have the right medicine.</detail><detail>Check the date on the vial. DO NOT use medicine that is out of date.</detail><detail>You may have a multi-dose vial. Or you may have a vial with powder that you mix with liquid. Read or ask about instructions if you have to mix your medicine.</detail><detail>If you will use the medicine more than once, write the date on the vial so you remember when you opened it.</detail><detail>Look at the medicine in the vial. Check for a change in color, small pieces floating in the liquid, cloudiness, or any other changes. </detail></h2><h2 title="Get the Vial Ready"><text>Prepare your medicine vial:</text><detail>If this is your first time using this medicine, take the cap off the vial.</detail><detail>Wipe the rubber top clean with an alcohol pad. </detail></h2><h2 title="Filling the Syringe With Medicine"><text>Follow these steps to fill the syringe with medicine:</text><detail>Hold the syringe in your hand like a pencil, with the needle pointed up.</detail><detail>With the cap still on, pull back the plunger to the line on your syringe for your dose. This fills the syringe with air.</detail><detail>Insert the needle into the rubber top. DO NOT touch or bend the needle.</detail><detail>Push the air into the vial. This keeps a vacuum from forming.

Keep the needle tip in the medicine.</detail><detail>Pull back the plunger to the line on your syringe for your dose. For example, if you need 1 cc of medicine, pull the plunger to the line marked 1 cc on the syringe. Note that some bottles of medicine may say mL. One cc of medicine is the same amount as one mL of medicine.</detail><text>To remove air bubbles from the syringe:</text><detail>Keep the syringe tip in the medicine.</detail><detail>Tap the syringe with your finger to move air bubbles to the top.

<item><title>Domestic violence</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000816.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>Domestic violence is when a person uses abusive behavior to control a partner or other family member. The abuse can be physical, emotional, economic, or sexual. It can affect people of any age, sex, culture, or class. When domestic violence is aimed at a child, it is called child abuse. Domestic violence is a crime. 
</text></h2><h2 title="Types of Domestic Violence"><text>Domestic violence can include any of these behaviors:</text><detail>Physical abuse, including hitting, kicking, biting, slapping, choking, or attacking with a weapon.</detail><detail>Sexual abuse, forcing someone to have any type of sexual activity he or she does not want.</detail><detail>Emotional abuse, including name-calling, humiliation, threats to the person or his or her family, or not letting the person see family or friends.</detail><detail>Economic abuse, such as controlling access to money or bank accounts. </detail></h2><h2 title="Signs of Domestic Violence"><text>Most people do not start out in abusive relationships. The abuse often starts slowly and gets worse over time, as the relationship deepens.</text><text>Some signs that your partner may be abusive include:</text><detail>Wanting most of your time</detail><detail>Hurting you and saying it is your fault</detail><detail>Trying to control what you do or whom you see</detail><detail>Keeping you from seeing family or friends</detail><detail>Being overly jealous of time you spend with others</detail><detail>Pressuring you to do things you do not want to do, such as having sex or doing drugs</detail><detail>Keeping you from going to work or school</detail><detail>Putting you down</detail><detail>Intimidating you or threatening your family or pets</detail><detail>Accusing you of having affairs</detail><detail>Controlling your finances</detail><detail>Threatening to hurt himself or herself if you leave </detail></h2><h2 title="How to get Help"><text>Leaving an abusive relationship is not easy. You may be afraid your partner will harm you if you leave, or that you will not have the financial or emotional support you need.</text><text>Domestic violence is not your fault. You cannot stop your partner's abuse. But you can find ways to get help for yourself.</text><detail>Tell someone. The first step in getting out of an abusive relationship is often telling someone else about it. You can talk to a friend, family member, your health care provider, or a clergy member.</detail><detail>Have a safety plan. This is a plan in case you need to leave a violent situation right away. Decide where you will go and what you will bring. Gather important items you will need, like credit cards, cash, or papers, in case you need to leave quickly. You can also pack a suitcase and keep it with a family member or friend.</detail><detail>Call for help. You can call the National Domestic Violence Hotline toll-free at 800-799-7233, 24 hours a day. The staff at the hotline can help you find resources for domestic violence in your area, including legal help.</detail><detail>Get medical care. If you are hurt, get medical care from your provider or at the emergency room.</detail><detail>Call the police. DO NOT hesitate to call the police if you are in danger. Domestic violence is a crime. </detail></h2><h2 title="How to Help a Loved one"><text>If a friend or family member is being abused, there are many ways you can help.</text><detail>Offer support. Your loved one may feel scared, alone, or ashamed. Let him or her know you are there to help however you can.</detail><detail>DO NOT judge. Leaving an abusive relationship is difficult. Your loved one may stay in the relationship despite the abuse. Or, your loved one may leave and return many times. Try to support these choices, even if you do not agree with them.</detail><detail>Help with a safety plan. Suggest that your loved one make a safety plan in case of danger. Offer your home as a safe zone if he or she needs to leave, or help find another safe place.</detail><detail>Find help. Help your loved one connect with a national hotline or a domestic violence agency in your area. </detail></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>Intimate partner violence; Spousal abuse; Elder abuse; Child abuse; Sexual abuse - domestic violence</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 7/13/2016"><text>Updated by: Linda J.

The feeling of spinning:</text><detail>Often starts suddenly</detail><detail>Is usually started by moving the head</detail><detail>Lasts a few seconds to minutes </detail></h2><h2 title="What to Expect"><text>Most often, people say the spinning feeling can start when they roll over in bed or tilt their head up to look at something.</text><text>Along with lightheadedness and vertigo, you may also have:</text><detail>Nausea and vomiting</detail><detail>Hearing loss</detail><detail>Ringing in your ears (tinnitus)</detail><detail>Vision problems, such as a feeling that things are jumping or moving</detail><detail>Loss of balance, difficulty standing up</detail><text>Lightheadedness usually gets better by itself, or is easily treated. However, it can be a symptom of other problems. There are many causes. Medicines may cause dizziness, or problems with your ear. Motion sickness can also make you dizzy.</text><text>Vertigo can be a symptom of many disorders, as well. Some may be chronic, long-term conditions. Some may come and go. Depending on the cause of your vertigo, you may have other symptoms, like benign positional vertigo or Meniere disease. It is important to have your doctor decide if your vertigo is a sign of a serious problem.</text></h2><h2 title="Self-care"><text>If you have vertigo, you may be able to prevent your symptoms from getting worse by:</text><detail>Avoiding sudden movements or position changes</detail><detail>Keeping still and resting when you have symptoms</detail><detail>Avoiding bright lights, TV, and reading when you have symptoms </detail><text>When you feel better, slowly increase your activity. If you lose your balance, you may need help walking to stay safe. </text><text>A sudden, dizzy spell during certain activities can be dangerous. Wait 1 week after a severe spell of vertigo is gone before you climb, drive, or operate heavy machinery or consult your health care provider for advice. Chronic lightheadedness or vertigo can cause stress. Make healthy lifestyle choices to help you cope:</text><detail>Get enough sleep.</detail><detail>Eat a well-balanced, healthy diet. Do not overeat.</detail><detail>Exercise regularly, if possible.</detail><detail>Learn and practice ways to relax, such as guided imagery, progressive muscle relaxation, yoga, tai chi, or meditation. </detail></h2><h2 title="Home Safety"><text>Make your home as safe as you can, just in case you lose your balance.

You may have received fluids and drugs that fight infections through an intravenous (IV) tube in your vein. You were probably on a special diet to help your colon rest and heal.</text><text>If your diverticulitis was very bad, or a repeat of past swelling, you may need surgery.</text><text>Your health care provider may also recommend that you have further tests to look at your colon (large intestine) such as colonoscopy.

<item><title>Distracted driving</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000818.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>Distracted driving is doing any activity that takes your attention away from driving. This includes using a cell phone to call or text while driving. Distracted driving makes you more likely to get into a crash.</text><text>As a result, many states have enacted laws to help stop the practice. You can avoid distracted driving by learning how to stay safe with a cell phone in the car.</text></h2><h2 title="Examples of Distracted Driving"><text>To drive safely, the National Safety Council says you should have:</text><detail>Your eyes on the road</detail><detail>Your hands on the wheel</detail><detail>Your mind on driving</detail><text>Distracted driving occurs when something gets in the way of you doing all 3 things. Examples include:</text><detail>Talking on a cell phone</detail><detail>Reading or sending text messages</detail><detail>Eating and drinking</detail><detail>Grooming (fixing your hair, shaving, or putting on makeup)</detail><detail>Adjusting a radio or other device that plays music</detail><detail>Using a navigation system</detail><detail>Reading (including maps)</detail></h2><h2 title="The Dangers of Talking on the Phone While Driving"><text>You are four times more likely to get into a car crash if you are talking on a cell phone. That is the same risk as driving drunk. Reaching for the phone, dialing it, and talking all take your attention away from driving.</text><text>Even hands-free phones are not that safe. When drivers use hands-free phones, they do not see or hear things that can help them avoid a crash. This includes stop signs, red lights, and pedestrians. About 25% of all car crashes involve cell phone use, including hands-free phones.</text><text>Talking to other people in the car is less risky than talking on a phone. A passenger can see traffic problems ahead and stop talking. They also provide another set of eyes to spot and point out traffic hazards.</text></h2><h2 title="Texting and Driving: Even More Dangerous"><text>Texting while driving is riskier than talking on a phone. Typing on the phone takes more of your attention than other distractions. Even talking into the phone to send a text message (voice-to-text) is not safe.</text><text>When you text, your eyes are off the road for an average of 5 seconds. At 55 mph, a car travels half the length of a football field in 5 seconds. A lot can happen in that short amount of time.</text></h2><h2 title="Who is at Risk"><text>Distracted driving is a problem among people of all ages. But teens and young adults are at the highest risk. Most teens and young people say they have written, sent, or read texts while driving. Younger inexperienced drivers have the highest number of fatal crashes caused by distracted driving. If you are a parent, teach your child about the dangers of talking and texting while driving.</text></h2><h2 title="How to Stop Distracted Driving"><text>Use these tips to steer clear of distractions while driving:</text><detail>DO NOT multitask. Before you turn on your car, finish eating, drinking, and grooming. Program your audio and navigation systems before you start to drive.</detail><detail>When you get in the driver's seat, turn off your phone and place it out of reach. If you are caught using a phone while driving, you may risk a ticket or fine. Most states have banned texting while driving for people of all ages. Some have also banned the use of handheld phones while driving. Learn about the laws in your state at: www.distraction.gov/stats-research-laws/state-laws.html.</detail><detail>Download an app that locks the phone. These apps work by blocking features like texting and calling while the car is moving over a set speed limit. Most are controlled remotely through a website and charge a monthly or yearly fee. You can also buy systems that plug into the car's computer or are placed on the windshield that limit cell phone use while the car is moving.</detail><detail>Pledge not to use your cell phone while driving. Sign the National Highway Safety Administration's pledge at www.distraction.gov/take-action/take-the-pledge.html. It also includes a promise to speak out if the driver in your car is distracted and to encourage friends and family to drive phone-free. </detail></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>Safety - distracted driving</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 7/22/2016"><text>Updated by: Linda J.

<item><title>Dietary fats explained</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000104.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>Fats are important part of your diet but some types are healthier than others. Choosing healthy fats from vegetable sources more often than less healthy types from animal products can help lower your risk for heart attack, stroke, and other major health problems.</text></h2><h2 title="What are Fats?"><text>Fats are a type of nutrient that you get from your diet. It is essential to eat some fats, though it is also harmful to eat too many.</text><text>The fats you eat give your body energy that it needs to work properly. During exercise, your body uses calories from carbohydrates you have eaten. But after 20 minutes, exercise then depends on calories from fat to keep you going.</text><text>You also need fat to keep your skin and hair healthy. Fat also helps you absorb vitamins A, D, E, and K, the so-called fat-soluble vitamins. Fat also fills your fat cells and insulates your body to help keep you warm.</text><text>The fats your body gets from your food give your body essential fatty acids called linoleic and linolenic acid. They are called "essential" because your body cannot make them itself, or work without them. Your body needs them for brain development, controlling inflammation, and blood clotting.</text><text>Fat has 9 calories per gram, more than 2 times the number of calories in carbohydrates and protein, which each have 4 calories per gram. </text><text>All fats are made up of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids. Fats are called saturated or unsaturated depending on how much of each type of fatty acid they contain.</text></h2><h2 title="Types of fat"><text>Saturated fats raise your LDL (bad) cholesterol level. High LDL cholesterol puts you at risk for heart attack, stroke, and other major health problems. You should avoid or limit foods that are high in saturated fats.</text><detail>Keep saturated fats to less than 6% of your total daily calories.</detail><detail>Foods with a lot of saturated fats are animal products, such as butter, cheese, whole milk, ice cream, cream, and fatty meats.</detail><detail>Some vegetable oils, such as coconut, palm, and palm kernel oil, also contain saturated fats. These fats are solid at room temperature.</detail><detail>A diet high in saturated fat increases cholesterol buildup in your arteries (blood vessels). Cholesterol is a soft, waxy substance that can cause clogged, or blocked, arteries. </detail><text>Eating unsaturated fats instead of saturated fats can help lower your LDL cholesterol. Most vegetable oils that are liquid at room temperature have unsaturated fats. There are two kinds of unsaturated fats:</text><detail>Mono-unsaturated fats, which include olive and canola oil</detail><detail>Polyunsaturated fats, which include safflower, sunflower, corn, and soy oil </detail><text>Trans fatty acids are unhealthy fats that form when vegetable oil hardens in a process called hydrogenation. Hydrogenated fats, or "trans fats," are often used to keep some foods fresh for a long time.</text><text>Trans fats are also used for cooking in some restaurants. They can raise LDL cholesterol levels in your blood. They can also lower your HDL (good) cholesterol levels.</text><text>Trans fats are under review for their health effects. Experts are working to limit the amount of trans fats used in packaged foods and restaurants.</text><text>You should avoid foods made with hydrogenated and partially hydrogenated oils (such as hard butter and margarine).

<item><title>Diet-busting foods</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000812.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>Diet-busting foods work against you if you are watching your weight. These food may taste good, but are low in nutrition and high in calories. Many of these foods leave you feeling hungry because they are low in fiber or protein. In general, diet-busting foods should make up a very small portion of your overall diet. </text></h2><h2 title="Worst Offenders"><text>High-fat foods. Most high-fat foods have a lot of calories but little nutrition. Many of these diet-busting foods are made with unhealthy saturated or trans fats. These types of fats are solid at room temperature. For instance, the fat in cheese and butter is solid. By contrast, heart-healthy olive oil is a liquid fat. Still, you should always control your portions, because too much of any fat can lead to weight gain. </text><text>High-fat foods include:</text><detail>Fatty meats, such as sausage, bacon, and ribs</detail><detail>Dishes made with full-fat cheese, such as pizza, burritos, and mac and cheese</detail><detail>Fried foods</detail><detail>Whole-fat dairy foods, such as ice cream or pudding</detail><detail>Foods prepared in cream, such as creamy sauces and soups </detail><text>Refined grains. Unlike diet-boosting whole grains, most of the nutrients and fiber have been stripped away from these grains in the refining process. As a result, they leave you hungry.</text><text>Refined grains include:</text><detail>White bread</detail><detail>Pasta made with white flour</detail><detail>White rice </detail><text>High-calorie drinks. Sweetened beverages are generally very high in calories.</text><detail>Soda. A 16-ounce (480 mL) can of sugary soda has almost as many calories as a cookie.</detail><detail>Fruit juice. Most fruit juice is high in sugar and low in fruit. Look for 100% fruit juice with no added corn syrup, dextrose, sucrose, or syrup. Watch your serving size, because 100% juices are still high in calories. They often do not have as many nutrients as the whole fruit they are squeezed from. A better option is to eat a piece of fruit. The added fiber and bulk will help you feel fuller.</detail><detail>Sports and energy drinks. Many of these drinks are high in sugar and calories. Energy drinks also have a lot of caffeine. Unless you exercise hard enough to sweat for an hour or more, you are better off drinking water. You can also choose low-calorie versions of these drinks.</detail><detail>Coffee drinks. Coffee is low in calories on its own. But once you add high-fat milk, sugary flavorings, and whipped cream, the calorie count soars. </detail><text>Baked goods. High in fat, sugar, and refined grains, pastries and baked desserts are diet-busters on every level. Limit these foods to the occasional treat and make sure you watch your portion sizes. These include:</text><detail>Donuts</detail><detail>Muffins</detail><detail>Scones</detail><detail>Cake</detail><detail>Cookies</detail><detail>Brownies </detail></h2><h2 title="They Seem Healthy, But They are not"><text>Exercise bars. These bars may have earned their healthy reputation because they are sold to give you energy for exercise. But most of them are more like candy bars: low in fiber, and high in sugar, fat, and calories. Unless you need some quick energy in the middle of a race or training session, look for a healthier way to refuel.</text><text>Cream-based soups. The advice to make a meal of soup and salad can backfire if your cup of soup has the calorie and fat profile of a hamburger. Creamy soups like mushroom bisque and many chowders have around 400 calories in 1 cup (250 mL). Broth-based soups like minestrone have around 100 calories.</text><text>Creamy salad dressing. Ranch, peppercorn, and blue cheese dressings can turn a healthy salad into a high-fat meal. But you do not need to go totally nonfat. Instead, use a spoonful of dressing made with healthy fats such as avocados, olive oil, or yogurt. If you do choose to indulge in a creamy dressing, measure it out carefully and limit your portions to no more than 1 to 2 tbsp (15 to 30 mL).</text><text>Sugar-free foods. If a food that is usually made with sugar is labeled sugar free, check the calories on the nutrition label. Often, extra fat and salt are added to make up for the lack of sugar.</text><text>Potatoes. Whether a potato is diet-busting or diet-boosting depends on how you cook it. A baked potato has about 120 calories. You can top it with broccoli and drizzle it with olive oil. But once you fry a potato or turn it into hash browns, the calories more than double and unhealthy fats increase dramatically.</text></h2><h2 title="Healthy in Small Amounts"><text>Nuts. High in fiber, nuts are a tasty way to eat heart-healthy fat. But nuts are also high in calories. One cup of chopped nuts can contain more than 700 calories. To get a dose of protein and heart-healthy fat, limit yourself to 1 to 2 tbsp (15 to 30 mL) of peanut butter or a small handful of unsalted nuts like almonds or walnuts.</text><text>Dried fruit. The drying process takes away the water and a lot of the volume, making dried fruit higher in calories and sugar than a similar portion size of fresh fruit. A cup (150 grams) of dried figs has 371 calories and 71 grams of sugar. Compare that to 2 large fresh figs, which have a total of 94 calories and 20 grams of sugar. Portion control is the key to eating dried fruit without busting your diet.</text><text>Granola. This is another food best eaten in small portions. A cup (120 grams) of granola can range from 343 calories in a low-fat version you buy in the store, to 597 calories in a cup of homemade granola. Many commercial versions have added sugar and fat. Like dried fruit and nuts, granola is packed with fiber and nutrients. Read labels, pay attention to serving sizes, watch the calorie count, and eat granola in small amounts. A half cup (60 grams) or less can dress up a bowl of nonfat yogurt or make a delicious topping for fresh fruit.</text></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>Obesity - diet-busting foods; Overweight - diet-busting foods; Weight loss - diet busting foods</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 8/3/2018"><text>Updated by: Linda J.

<item><title>Diet-boosting foods</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000810.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>Diet-boosting foods nourish you without adding a lot of extra calories from sugar and saturated fat. Compared to diet-busting foods, these healthy options are high in nutrients and take longer to digest, so you stay full longer.</text></h2><h2 title="Fruit and Vegetables"><text>Any healthy diet includes fruit and vegetables every day. Foods that grow on farms, in gardens, or on trees are loaded with nutrients and fiber. They fill you up and give you a steady flow of energy.</text><text>Ways to eat fruit. Keep a fruit bowl stocked in your kitchen for a quick, healthy snack. If you are short on time, use frozen fruit that comes pre-sliced. Check to make sure there is no added sugar. The ingredient list should only include fruit. Other serving suggestions include:</text><detail>Berries over nonfat yogurt</detail><detail>Fruit smoothie with nonfat yogurt</detail><detail>Citrus salad with walnuts</detail><detail>Watermelon salad with balsamic vinegar</detail><detail>Grilled pineapple, peaches, or nectarines</detail><detail>Poached pears</detail><detail>Spinach and pear salad</detail><text>Ways to eat vegetables. Cut raw veggies like carrots or bell peppers into sticks so you can snack on them throughout the day. You can also eat them in a salad. Like fruit, many vegetables come pre-cut and frozen. Again, check the label to make sure the ingredient list only includes vegetables. Try these vegetable recipe ideas:</text><detail>Stir-fried broccoli over brown rice</detail><detail>Collard greens with a fried egg</detail><detail>Roasted beets with fennel and orange slices</detail><detail>Corn and tomato salad</detail><detail>Grilled veggie kabobs or roasted vegetables</detail><detail>Store-bought low-sodium soups with added frozen veggies</detail><detail>Frozen vegetables stirred into boiling pasta during the last 5 minutes of cooking</detail></h2><h2 title="Beans"><text>Beans are a great source of protein and fiber. You can use beans to reduce or even replace meat in many dishes.</text><text>Ways to eat beans. If you do not have time to pre-soak and cook dry beans, canned beans will save you time. Just be sure you buy beans that are low in salt (sodium). You can also reduce the sodium content by rinsing and draining canned beans. Here are some tasty ways to eat more beans:</text><detail>Vegetarian chili with kidney beans</detail><detail>Black-eyed pea salsa</detail><detail>Hummus made with garbanzo beans</detail><detail>Lentil soup with carrots and spinach</detail><detail>Split pea soup</detail><detail>Brown rice and pinto beans</detail><detail>White bean salad with lemon and avocado</detail><detail>Veggie burgers </detail></h2><h2 title="Whole Grains"><text>At least one half of the grains you eat should be whole grains. Whole grains still have most of the nutrients and fiber they started with as plants, because whole grains contain the entire grain kernel. That is why whole-grain bread has texture and white bread is smooth.</text><text>Ways to eat whole grains. When choosing foods made with whole grains, check the ingredients list, whole grains should be listed first. Great ways to get more whole grains include:</text><detail>Whole-wheat or multigrain toast with avocado</detail><detail>Oatmeal with berries</detail><detail>Wild rice and mushroom salad</detail><detail>Brown rice with stir-fried vegetables</detail><detail>Whole-grain barley and vegetable soup</detail><detail>Whole-wheat pizza with grilled vegetables and marinara sauce</detail><detail>Popcorn with little or no added salt and butter</detail></h2><h2 title="Low-Fat and Nonfat Dairy Foods"><text>Low-fat and nonfat milk, yogurt, and cottage cheese are healthy sources of calcium, vitamin D, and potassium. Unlike sweetened drinks with extra calories, milk fills you up with nutrients. </text><text>Ways to get more dairy. Get creative when adding dairy to your diet:</text><detail>Add milk to high-fiber cereal</detail><detail>Cook your oatmeal with skim milk instead of water</detail><detail>Eat yogurt alone, with fruit, or drizzled with honey</detail><detail>Use yogurt-based salad dressing</detail><detail>Substitute Greek yogurt for sour cream</detail><detail>Snack on low-fat or nonfat cheese sticks</detail><detail>Spread low-fat cottage cheese on wheat crackers and top with tomatoes</detail><detail>Add a spoonful of nonfat cottage cheese to scrambled eggs </detail></h2><h2 title="Foods to Eat in Moderation "><text>Add limited amounts of these foods to your diet.</text><text>Nuts. In small amounts, nuts are a great source of fiber, protein, and healthy fat. But nuts are also high in calories, and they are easy to overeat. Eat them sparingly. Portion nuts out ahead of time, rather than eating them straight from the container. Add nuts to salads and main dishes as a source of protein.</text><text>Healthy oils. Oils such as olive oil, canola oil, sunflower oil, safflower oil, and soft margarine are great replacements for oils that are high in solid fat, like butter and shortening. Many oils that are high in solid fat are bad for your waist and heart.</text><text>Use healthy oils instead of butter for cooking and in salad dressings to add richness to your meals. Like nuts, oils are high in calories, so they are healthiest in smaller amounts.</text><text>Seafood. Seafood is high in nutrients and heart-healthy fat. The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) recommends eating at least one 8-ounce (226 grams) serving of seafood every week. Healthy choices include sardines, herring, tilapia, and trout.</text><text>Chicken. Chicken is healthiest when you roast, broil, or grill it. Chicken breasts are lower in fat and calories than chicken thighs. It is fine to cook chicken with the skin on, which helps keep it moist. Remove the skin before eating to save about 50 calories and almost 5 grams of fat.</text><text>Fried chicken, chicken wings, or chicken served in cream sauce are a few of the many ways to make chicken unhealthy. You are best off avoiding these chicken options.</text><text>Lean cuts of meat. Whether meat is lean or high in fat depends on the part of the animal it came from.</text><detail>A serving of pork loin has 3 grams of fat. Spare ribs have 26 grams of fat.</detail><detail>A top sirloin steak has 7 grams of fat. Prime rib has almost 23 grams of fat.</detail><detail>Look for ground meat labeled "97% to 99% lean."</detail><text>It is even healthier to use lean meat as a garnish instead of as a main course. For example, cook some lean ground beef, drain any oil, and add it, along with chopped carrots and zucchini, to a pot of tomato sauce.</text></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>Obesity - diet-boosting foods; Overweight - diet-boosting foods</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 8/3/2018"><text>Updated by: Linda J.

<item><title>Diet myths and facts</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000895.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>A diet myth is advice that becomes popular without facts to back it up. When it comes to weight loss, many popular beliefs are myths and others are only partly true. Here are some facts to help you sort through what you hear.</text><text>MYTH? Cut back on carbs to lose weight.</text><text>FACT:Carbohydrates come in different forms: simple and complex. Simple carbs found in foods like cookies and candy lack vitamins, minerals, and fiber. Cutting back on these sweets, is a great way to eat healthier. Foods with complex carbs like whole-wheat bread, beans, and fruit, have lots of nutrients that are good for you.</text><detail>Cut back on simple carbs but keep complex carbs on the menu. </detail><text>MYTH? If the label says "no-fat" or "low-fat," you can eat all you want and not gain weight.</text><text>FACT: Many low-fat or no-fat foods have added sugar, starch, or salt to make up for the reduction in fat. These "wonder" foods often have just as many calories, or more, than the regular version.</text><detail>Check the nutrition label to see how many calories are in a serving. Be sure to check the serving size too. </detail><text>MYTH? Skipping breakfast makes you gain weight.</text><text>FACT: Eating a healthy breakfast can help you manage your hunger later in the day and help you to say, "No thanks," to unhealthy snacks. No scientific studies have shown that skipping the morning meal leads directly to weight gain.</text><detail>If you are not hungry first thing, listen to your body. When you are ready to eat, help yourself to a healthy option like oatmeal with fresh berries.</detail><text>MYTH? Eating at night will make you fat.</text><text>FACT: People who eat late at night do tend to put on extra weight. One possible reason is that late-night eaters tend to choose high-calorie treats. Some people who snack after dinner do not sleep well, which can lead to unhealthy cravings the next day.</text><detail>If you are hungry after dinner, limit yourself to healthy snacks such as low-fat yogurt or baby carrots.</detail><text>MYTH? You cannot be overweight and healthy.</text><text>FACT: There are some people who are overweight with healthy blood pressure, cholesterol, and blood sugar levels. For most people, excess weight increases the risk for heart disease and diabetes. The longer you are overweight, the more your risk of developing disease increases.</text><detail>While you can be overweight and healthy, carrying extra weight will increase your risk for health problems down the line, but healthy eating and regular activity are good for you no matter what you weigh.</detail><text>MYTH? Fasting can help you lose weight quickly.</text><text>FACT: Fasting is not healthy if you go hungry all day and cap it off with a huge meal that replaces all the calories you skipped earlier. Compared to people who lose fat by eating fewer calories, people who fast lose more muscle than fat.</text><detail>Look at your daily diet for empty calories you can cut out, such as refined grains and sugary drinks. DO NOT cut out meals entirely, especially without a doctor's supervision.</detail><text>MYTH? You have to set modest goals if you want to lose weight.</text><text>FACT: In theory, it makes sense that if you set ambitious goals and do not reach them, you might give up. However, some people actually lose more weight when they set goals that make them push themselves.</text><detail>No two people are the same. What works for someone else may not work for you. Losing weight is a process. Be ready to modify your plan as you discover what works and does not work for you.</detail><text>MYTH? Slow weight loss is the only way to lose weight and keep it off.</text><text>FACT: While it is true that many people who lose a lot of weight in a short time gain it all back, this is not true for everyone. Some overweight people are more successful when they lose weight quickly, for instance, going from 300 to 250 pounds (135 to 112 kilograms) in less than a year.</text><detail>Slow weight loss might not be the only option for you. Just be careful to avoid fad diets that promise unrealistic results, they may not be safe. If you are interested in a diet that encourages faster weight loss, be sure to work with your health care provider to make sure you are getting all the nutrients you need.</detail></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>Obesity - diet myths and facts; Overweight - diet myths and fact; Weight-loss diet myths and facts</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 4/23/2018"><text>Updated by: Emily Wax, RD, The Brooklyn Hospital Center, Brooklyn, NY.

<item><title>Diet for rapid weight loss</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000885.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>Rapid weight loss diet is a type of diet in which you lose more than 2 pounds (1 kilogram, kg) a week over several weeks. To lose weight this quickly you eat very few calories. </text></h2><h2 title="How It Works"><text>These diets are most often chosen by obese people who want to lose weight quickly. These diets are rarely recommended by health care providers. People on these diets should be followed closely by a provider. Rapid weight loss is not safe for most people to do on their own.</text><text>These diets are only to be used for a short time and are not recommended for more than several weeks. The types of rapid weight loss diets are described below.</text><text>People who lose weight very quickly are much more likely to regain the weight over time than people who lose weight slowly through less drastic diet changes and physical activity.</text></h2><h2 title="Very Low-Calorie Diet (VLCD)"><text>On a VLCD, you may have as few as 800 calories a day and may lose up to 3 to 5 pounds (1.5 to 2 kg) week. Most VLCDs use meal replacements, such as formulas, soups, shakes, and bars instead of regular meals. This helps ensure that you get all of the nutrients you need each day. </text><text>A VLCD is only recommended for adults who are obese and need to lose weight for health reasons. These diets are often used before weight-loss surgery. You should only use a VLCD with the help of your provider. Most experts DO NOT recommend using a VLCD for more than 12 weeks. </text></h2><h2 title="Low-Calorie Diet (LCD)"><text>These diets usually allow about 1,000 to 1,200 calories a day for women and 1,200 to 1,600 calories a day for men. An LCD is a better choice than a VLCD for most people who want to lose weight quickly. But you should still be supervised by a provider. You will not lose weight as fast with an LCD, but you can lose just as much weight with a VLCD. </text><text>An LCD may use a mix of meal replacements and regular food. This makes it easier to follow than a VLCD. </text></h2><h2 title="Fad Diets"><text>Some fad diets also severely limit calories to achieve rapid weight loss. In many cases, these diets are not safe. Once you stop the diet, you are at risk for regaining the weight if you return to your old eating habits. For most people, it is safest to choose a diet in which you lose a 1/2 pound to 1 pound (225 grams to 500 grams) a week.</text></h2><h2 title="The Role of Exercise"><text>Rapid weight loss is more about cutting calories than exercising. Talk with your provider about what type of exercise you should do while you are on this type of diet. Your provider may suggest waiting until you are on a more long-term diet to start exercising.</text></h2><h2 title="Health Benefits"><text>Rapid weight loss diet is usually for people who have health problems because of obesity. For these people, losing a lot of weight quickly can help improve:</text><detail>Diabetes</detail><detail>High cholesterol</detail><detail>High blood pressure </detail></h2><h2 title="Possible Health Concerns"><text>You should only follow one of these diets with the help of your provider. Losing more than 1 or 2 pounds (0.5 to 1 kg) a week is not safe for most people. It can cause you to lose muscle, water, and bone density. Rapid weight loss can also cause some side effects including:</text><detail>Gallstones</detail><detail>Gout</detail><detail>Fatigue</detail><detail>Constipation</detail><detail>Diarrhea</detail><detail>Nausea </detail><text>People who lose weight quickly are also more likely to gain back the weight quickly. This can lead to other health problems.</text><text>In general, a rapid weight loss diet is not safe for children. It may also not be safe for teens, pregnant women or older adults unless a provider recommends it. </text><text>If you have a health condition, it is a good idea to talk with your provider before starting this or any diet plan to lose weight.</text></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>Very low-calorie diet; VLCD; Low-calorie diet; LCD; Very low energy diet; Weight loss - rapid weight loss; Overweight - rapid weight loss; Obesity - rapid weight loss; Diet - rapid weight loss</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 5/17/2018"><text>Updated by: Brent Wisse, MD, Associate Professor of Medicine, Division of Metabolism, Endocrinology &amp;amp; Nutrition, University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle, WA.

<item><title>Diet after gastric banding </title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000334.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>You had laparoscopic gastric banding. This surgery made your stomach smaller by closing off part of your stomach with an adjustable band. After surgery you will eat less food, and you will not be able to eat quickly.</text><text>Your health care provider will teach you about foods you can eat and foods you should avoid. It is very important to follow these diet guidelines.</text></h2><h2 title="When you go Home From the Hospital"><text>You will eat only liquid or pureed food for 2 to 3 weeks after your surgery. You will slowly add in soft foods, and then regular foods.</text><text>When you start eating solid foods again, you will feel full very quickly. Just a few bites of solid food will fill you up. This is because your new stomach pouch holds only a tablespoonful of food at first, about the size of a walnut.</text><text>Your pouch may get larger over time. You DO NOT want to stretch it out, so DO NOT eat more than your provider advises. When your pouch is larger, it will not hold more than about 1 cup (250 milliliters) of chewed food. A normal stomach can hold up to 4 cups (1 liter, L) f chewed food.</text><text>You may lose weight quickly in the first 3 to 6 months after surgery. During this time, you may have: </text><detail>Body aches</detail><detail>Feel tired and cold</detail><detail>Dry skin</detail><detail>Mood changes</detail><detail>Hair loss or hair thinning </detail><text>These symptoms are normal. They should go away as your body gets used to your weight loss.</text></h2><h2 title="A new way of Eating"><text>Remember to eat slowly and chew each bite very slowly and completely. DO NOT swallow food until it is smooth. The opening between your new stomach pouch and the large part of the stomach is very small. Food that is not chewed well can block this opening.</text><detail>Take 20 to 30 minutes to eat a meal. If you vomit or have pain under your breastbone during or after eating, you may be eating too fast.</detail><detail>Eat 6 small meals during the day instead of 3 bigger meals. DO NOT snack between meals.</detail><detail>STOP EATING AS SOON AS YOU FEEL FULL.</detail><detail>DO NOT eat if you are not hungry.</detail><detail>Use small plates and utensils to help control portion sizes. </detail><text>Some foods you eat may cause some pain or discomfort if you do not chew them completely. Some of these are pasta, rice, bread, raw vegetables, and meats. Adding a low-fat sauce, broth gravy can make them easier to digest. Other foods that may cause discomfort are dry foods, such as popcorn and nuts, or fibrous foods, such as celery and corn.</text><text>You will need to drink up to 8 cups (64 ounces), or 2 L, of water or other calorie-free liquids every day:</text><detail>DO NOT drink anything for 30 minutes after a meal. Also, DO NOT drink anything while you are eating. The liquid will fill you up, and this may keep you from eating enough healthy food. Or it may lubricate the food and allow you to eat more than you should.</detail><detail>Take small sips when you are drinking. DO NOT gulp.</detail><detail>Ask your provider before using a straw, since it may bring air in your stomach. </detail></h2><h2 title="Follow Your Diet Carefully "><text>You will need to make sure you are getting enough protein, vitamins, and minerals while you are losing weight quickly. Eating mostly protein, fruits, vegetables, and whole grains will help your body get the nutrients it needs.</text><text>Protein may be the most important of these foods. Your body needs protein to build muscles and other body tissues. Low-fat protein choices include: </text><detail>Skinless chicken</detail><detail>Lean beef or pork</detail><detail>Fish</detail><detail>Whole eggs or egg whites</detail><detail>Beans</detail><detail>Dairy products, which includes low-fat or nonfat hard cheeses, cottage cheese, milk, and yogurt </detail><text>Combining foods with texture together with protein helps people who have a gastric band stay satisfied longer. This includes things like salad with grilled chicken or celery with peanut butter. </text><text>Because you are eating less, your body may not be getting enough of some important vitamins and minerals. Your provider may prescribe these:</text><detail>Multivitamin with iron</detail><detail>Vitamin B12</detail><detail>Calcium (1200 mg per day) and vitamin D. Your body can absorb only about 500 mg of calcium at a time. Divide your calcium into 2 or 3 doses per day. </detail><text>You will need to have regular checkups to keep track of your weight and to make sure you are eating well. These visits are a good time to talk about any problems you are having with your diet, or about other issues related to your surgery and recovery.</text></h2><h2 title="Calories Still Count"><text>Read food labels to avoid high-calorie foods. It is important to get as many nutrients as you can without eating too many calories. </text><detail>DO NOT eat foods that contain a lot of fats, sugar, or carbohydrates, particularly "slider" foods.

<item><title>Diarrhea in infants</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000691.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>Normal baby stools are soft and loose. Newborns have frequent stools, sometimes with every feeding. For these reasons, you may have trouble knowing when your baby has diarrhea.</text><text>Your baby may have diarrhea if you see changes in the stool, such as more stools all of a sudden; possibly more than one stool per feeding or really watery stools. </text></h2><h2 title="Causes of Diarrhea"><text>Diarrhea in babies usually does not last long. Most often, it is caused by a virus and goes away on its own. Your baby could also have diarrhea with:</text><detail>A change in your baby's diet or a change in the mother's diet if breastfeeding.</detail><detail>Use of antibiotics by the baby, or use by the mother if breastfeeding.</detail><detail>A bacterial infection. Your baby will need to take antibiotics to get better.</detail><detail>A parasite infection. Your baby will need to take medicine to get better.</detail><detail>Rare diseases such as cystic fibrosis. </detail></h2><h2 title="Diarrhea Causes Dehydration"><text>Infants and young children under age 3 can become dehydrated quickly and get really sick. Dehydration means that your baby does not have enough water or liquids. Watch your baby closely for signs of dehydration, which include:</text><detail>Dry eyes and little to no tears when crying</detail><detail>Fewer wet diapers than usual</detail><detail>Less active than usual, lethargic</detail><detail>Irritable</detail><detail>Dry mouth</detail><detail>Dry skin that does not spring back to its usual shape after being pinched</detail><detail>Sunken eyes</detail><detail>Sunken fontanelle (the soft spot on top of the head) </detail></h2><h2 title="Taking Care of Your Baby"><text>Make sure your baby gets plenty of liquids so she does not get dehydrated.</text><detail>Keep breastfeeding your baby if you are nursing. Breastfeeding helps prevent diarrhea, and your baby will recover quicker.</detail><detail>If you are using formula, make it full strength unless your health care provider gives you different advice. </detail><text>If your baby still seems thirsty after or between feedings, talk to your provider about giving your baby Pedialyte or Infalyte. Your provider may recommend these extra liquids that contain electrolytes.</text><detail>Try giving your baby 1 ounce (2 tablespoons or 30 milliliters) of Pedialyte or Infalyte, every 30 to 60 minutes. Do not water down Pedialyte or Infalyte. Do not give sports drinks to young infants.</detail><detail>Try giving your baby a Pedialyte popsicle. </detail><text>If your baby throws up, give them only a little bit of liquid at a time. Start with as little as 1 teaspoon (5 ml) of liquid every 10 to 15 minutes. Do not give your baby solid foods when she is vomiting.</text><text>DO NOT give your baby ant-diarrhea medicine unless your provider says it is OK.</text></h2><h2 title="Feeding Your Baby"><text>If your baby was on solid foods before the diarrhea began, start with foods that are easy on the stomach, such as:</text><detail>Bananas</detail><detail>Crackers</detail><detail>Toast</detail><detail>Pasta</detail><detail>Cereal </detail><text>Do not give your baby food that makes diarrhea worse, such as:</text><detail>Apple juice</detail><detail>Milk</detail><detail>Fried foods</detail><detail>Full-strength fruit juice </detail></h2><h2 title="Preventing Diaper Rash"><text>Your baby might get diaper rash because of the diarrhea. To prevent diaper rash:</text><detail>Change your baby's diaper frequently.</detail><detail>Clean your baby's bottom with water. Cut down on using baby wipes while your baby has diarrhea.</detail><detail>Let your baby's bottom air dry.</detail><detail>Use a diaper cream. </detail><text>Wash your hands well to keep you and other people in your household from getting sick. Diarrhea caused by germs can spread easily.</text></h2><h2 title="When to Call the Doctor"><text>Call your provider if your baby is a newborn (under 3 months old) and has diarrhea.</text><text>Also call if your child has signs of being dehydrated, including:</text><detail>Dry and sticky mouth</detail><detail>No tears when crying</detail><detail>No wet diaper for 6 hours </detail><text>Know the signs that your baby is not getting better, including:</text><detail>Fever and diarrhea that last for more than 2 to 3 days</detail><detail>More than 8 stools in 8 hours</detail><detail>Vomiting continues for more than 24 hours</detail><detail>Diarrhea contains blood, mucus, or pus</detail><detail>Your baby is much less active than normal (is not sitting up at all or looking around)</detail><detail>Seems to have stomach pain </detail></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>Diarrhea - babies</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 9/8/2017"><text>Updated by: Neil K.

<item><title>Dialysis centers - what to expect</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000706.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>If you need dialysis for kidney disease, you have a few options for how to receive treatment. Many people have dialysis in a treatment center. This article focuses on hemodialysis at a treatment center.</text></h2><h2 title="What to Expect"><text>You may have treatment in a hospital or in a separate dialysis center.</text><detail>You will have about 3 treatments a week.</detail><detail>Treatment takes about 3 to 4 hours each time.</detail><detail>You have to make appointments for your treatments. </detail><text>It is important not to miss or skip any dialysis sessions. Be sure you arrive on time. Many centers have busy schedules. So you may not be able to make up the time if you are late.</text><text>During dialysis, your blood will flow through a special filter that removes waste and excess fluid. The filter is sometimes called an artificial kidney.</text><text>Once you arrive at the center, trained health care providers will take charge of you.</text><detail>Your access area will be washed, and you will be weighed. Then you will be taken to a comfortable chair where you'll sit during treatment.</detail><detail>Your provider will check your blood pressure, temperature, breathing, heart rate, and pulse.</detail><detail>Needles will be placed in your access area to allow blood to flow in and out. This may be uncomfortable at first. If needed, your provider can apply a cream to numb the area.</detail><detail>The needles are attached to a tube that connects to the dialysis machine. Your blood will flow through the tube, into the filter, and back into your body.</detail><detail>The same site is used every time, and over time, a small tunnel will form in the skin. This is called a buttonhole, and it is like the hole that forms in a pierced ear. Once this forms, you will not notice the needles as much.</detail><detail>Your session will last 3 to 4 hours. During this time your provider will monitor your blood pressure and the dialysis machine.</detail><detail>During treatment, you can read, use a laptop, nap, watch TV, or chat with providers and other dialysis patients.</detail><detail>Once your session is over, your provider will remove the needles and put a dressing on your access area.</detail><detail>You will probably feel tired after your sessions. </detail><text>During your first sessions, you may have some nausea, cramping, dizziness, and headaches. This may go away after a few sessions, but be sure to tell your providers if you feel unwell. Your providers may be able to adjust your treatment to help you feel more comfortable.</text><text>Having too much fluid in your body that needs to be removed can cause symptoms. This is why you should follow a strict kidney dialysis diet. Your provider will go over this with you.</text><text>How long your dialysis session lasts depends on:</text><detail>How well your kidneys work</detail><detail>How much waste needs to be removed</detail><detail>How much water weight you have gained</detail><detail>Your size</detail><detail>The type of dialysis machined used </detail></h2><h2 title="Between Sessions"><text>Getting dialysis does take a lot of time, and it will take some getting used to. Between sessions, you can still go about your daily routine.</text><text>Getting kidney dialysis does not have to keep you from traveling or working. There are many dialysis centers across the United States and in many other countries. If you plan to travel, you will need to make appointments ahead of time.</text></h2><h2 title="When to Call Your Doctor"><text>Call your provider if you notice:</text><detail>Bleeding from your vascular access site</detail><detail>Signs of infection, such as redness, swelling, soreness, pain, warmth, or pus around the site</detail><detail>A fever over 100.5°F (38.0°C)</detail><detail>The arm where your catheter is placed swells and the hand on that side feels cold</detail><detail>Your hand gets cold, numb, or weak</detail><text>Also, call your provider if any of the following symptoms are severe or last more than 2 days:</text><detail>Itching</detail><detail>Trouble sleeping</detail><detail>Diarrhea or constipation</detail><detail>Nausea and vomiting</detail><detail>Drowsiness, confusion, or problems concentrating</detail></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>Artificial kidneys - dialysis centers; Dialysis - what to expect; Renal replacement therapy - dialysis centers; End-stage renal disease - dialysis centers; Kidney failure - dialysis centers; Renal failure - dialysis centers; Chronic kidney disease-dialysis centers</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 1/16/2018"><text>Updated by: Walead Latif, MD, Nephrologist and Clinical Associate Professor, Rutgers Medical School, Newark, NJ.

<item><title>Dialysis - hemodialysis</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000707.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>Dialysis treats end-stage kidney failure. It removes waste from your blood when your kidneys can no longer do their job.</text><text>There are different types of kidney dialysis. This article focuses on hemodialysis.</text></h2><h2 title="What is Hemodialysis?"><text>Your kidneys' main job is to remove toxins and extra fluid from your blood. If waste products build up in your body, it can be dangerous and even cause death.</text><text>Hemodialysis (and other types of dialysis) does some of the job of the kidneys when they stop working well.</text><text>Hemodialysis can:</text><detail>Remove extra salt, water, and waste products so they don't build up in your body</detail><detail>Keep safe levels of minerals and vitamins in your body</detail><detail>Help control blood pressure</detail><detail>Help produce red blood cells </detail><text>During hemodialysis, your blood passes through a tube into an artificial kidney or filter.</text><detail>The filter, called a dialyzer, is divided into 2 parts separated by a thin wall.</detail><detail>As your blood passes through one part of the filter, special fluid in the other part draws out waste from your blood.</detail><detail>Your blood then goes back into your body through a tube. </detail><text>Your doctor will create an access where the tube attaches. Usually, an access will be in a blood vessel in your arm.</text></h2><h2 title="When to Start Dialysis"><text>Kidney failure is the last stage of long-term (chronic) kidney disease. This is when your kidneys can no longer support your body's needs. Your doctor will discuss dialysis with you before you need it. Usually, you will go on dialysis when you have only 10% to 15% of your kidney function left.</text><text>You also may need dialysis if your kidneys suddenly stop working due to acute renal failure.</text></h2><h2 title="Dialysis at a Treatment Center"><text>Hemodialysis is most often done at a special dialysis center.</text><detail>You will have about 3 treatments a week.</detail><detail>Treatment takes about 3 to 4 hours each time.</detail><detail>You may feel tired for several hours after the dialysis. </detail><text>At a treatment center, your health care providers will handle all your care. However, you do need to schedule your appointments and follow a strict dialysis diet.</text></h2><h2 title="Dialysis at Home"><text>You may be able to have hemodialysis at home. You do not have to buy a machine. Medicare or your health insurance will pay for most or all of your treatment costs at home or in a center.</text><text>If you have dialysis at home, you can use one of two schedules:</text><detail>Shorter (2 to 3 hours) treatments done at least 5 to 7 days per week</detail><detail>Longer, nightly treatments done 3 to 6 nights per week while you sleep </detail><text>You also may be able to do a combination of daily and nighttime treatments.</text><text>Because you have treatment more often and it happens more slowly, home hemodialysis has some benefits:</text><detail>It helps keep your blood pressure lower. Many people no longer need blood pressure medicines.</detail><detail>It does a better job of removing waste products.</detail><detail>It's easier on your heart.</detail><detail>You may have fewer symptoms from dialysis such as nausea, headaches, cramps, and tiredness.</detail><detail>You can more easily fit treatments into your schedule. </detail><text>You can do the treatment yourself, or you can have someone help you. A dialysis nurse can train you and a caregiver on how to do home dialysis. Training can take a few weeks to a few months. Both you and your caregivers must learn to:</text><detail>Handle the equipment</detail><detail>Place the needle into the access site</detail><detail>Monitor the machine and your blood pressure during treatment</detail><detail>Keep records</detail><detail>Clean the machine</detail><detail>Order supplies, which can be delivered to your home </detail><text>Home dialysis is not for everyone. You will have a lot to learn and need to be responsible for your care. Some people feel more comfortable having a provider handle their treatment. Plus, not all centers offer home dialysis.</text><text>Home dialysis may be a good option if you want more independence and are able to learn to treat yourself. Talk with your provider. Together, you can decide what type of hemodialysis is right for you.</text></h2><h2 title="When to Call Your Doctor"><text>Call your provider if you notice:</text><detail>Bleeding from your vascular access site</detail><detail>Signs of infection, such as redness, swelling, soreness, pain, warmth, or pus around the site</detail><detail>A fever over 100.5°F (38.0°C)</detail><detail>The arm where your catheter is placed swells and the hand on that side feels cold</detail><detail>Your hand gets cold, numb, or weak</detail><text>Also, call your doctor if any of the following symptoms are severe or last more than 2 days:</text><detail>Itching</detail><detail>Trouble sleeping</detail><detail>Diarrhea or constipation</detail><detail>Nausea and vomiting</detail><detail>Drowsiness, confusion, or problems concentrating</detail></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>Artificial kidneys - hemodialysis; Dialysis; Renal replacement therapy - hemodialysis; End-stage renal disease - hemodialysis; Kidney failure - hemodialysis; Renal failure - hemodialysis; Chronic kidney disease - hemodialysis</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 1/16/2018"><text>Updated by: Walead Latif, MD, Nephrologist and Clinical Associate Professor, Rutgers Medical School, Newark, NJ.

Your doctor will help decide what your target should be.</text><text>Higher A1C numbers mean that your blood sugar is higher and that you may be more likely to have complications from your diabetes.</text></h2><h2 title="Cholesterol"><text>A cholesterol profile test measures cholesterol and triglycerides in your blood. You should have this kind of test in the morning, after not eating since the night before.</text><text>Adults with type 2 diabetes should have this test every 5 years. People with high cholesterol or are on medicines to control their cholesterol may have this test more often.</text></h2><h2 title="Blood Pressure"><text>Blood pressure should be measured at every visit.</text></h2><h2 title="Kidney Tests"><text>Once a year, you should have a urine test that looks for a protein called albumin.</text><text>Your doctor will also have you take a blood test every year that measures how well your kidneys work.</text></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>Routine diabetes tests; Diabetes - prevention</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 5/17/2018"><text>Updated by: Brent Wisse, MD, Associate Professor of Medicine, Division of Metabolism, Endocrinology &amp;amp; Nutrition, University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle, WA.

<item><title>Diabetes eye exams</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000323.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>Diabetes can harm your eyes. It can damage the small blood vessels in your retina, or the back of your eye. This condition is called diabetic retinopathy.</text><text>Diabetes also increases your risk of glaucoma and other eye problems.</text><text>You may not know your eyes are harmed until the problem is very bad. Your doctor can catch problems early if you get regular eye exams. This is very important. The early stages of diabetic retinopathy don't cause changes in vision and you won't have symptoms. Only an eye exam can detect the problem, so that steps can be taken to prevent the retinopathy from getting worse.</text></h2><h2 title="You Need Regular eye Exams"><text>Even if the doctor who takes care of your diabetes checks your eyes, you need an eye exam every 1 to 2 years by an eye doctor who takes care of people with diabetes. An eye doctor has equipment that can check the back of your eye much better than your regular doctor can.</text><text>If you have eye problems because of diabetes, you will probably see your eye doctor more often. You may need special treatment to prevent your eye problems from getting worse.</text><text>You may see two different types of eye doctors:</text><detail>An ophthalmologist is a medical doctor who is an eye specialist trained to diagnose and treat eye problems.</detail><detail>An optometrist is a health care provider trained to diagnose and treat problems with your vision. Many can do screening exams for damage from diabetes. Once you have eye disease caused by diabetes, you need to see an ophthalmologist. </detail></h2><h2 title="What is a Dilated Retinal Exam?"><text>The doctor will check your vision using a chart of random letters of different sizes. This is called the Snellen chart.</text><text>You will then be given eye drops to widen (dilate) the pupils of your eyes so that the doctor can better see the back of the eye. You may feel stinging when the drops are first placed. You may have a metallic taste in your mouth.</text><text>To see the back of your eye, the doctor looks through a special magnifying glass using a bright light. The doctor can then see areas that may be damaged by diabetes:</text><detail>Blood vessels in the front or middle parts of the eye</detail><detail>The back of the eye</detail><detail>The optic nerve area </detail><text>Another device called a slit lamp is used to see the clear surface of the eye (cornea).</text><text>The doctor may take photos of the back of your eye to get a more detailed exam.</text><text>The eye doctor may use a special camera to take photos of your retina without dilating your eyes. The doctor then views the photos and lets you know if you need more tests or treatment.</text></h2><h2 title="After Your eye Exam"><text>If you had drops to dilate your eyes, your vision will be blurred for about 6 hours. It will be harder to focus on things that are near. You should have someone drive you home.</text><text>Sunlight can damage your eye. Wear dark glasses or shade your eyes until the effects of the drops wear off.</text></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>Diabetic retinopathy - eye exams; Diabetes - eye exams; Glaucoma - diabetic eye exam; Macular edema - diabetic eye exam</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 8/7/2016"><text>Updated by: Brent Wisse, MD, Associate Professor of Medicine, Division of Metabolism, Endocrinology &amp;amp; Nutrition, University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle, WA.

It can damage the small blood vessels in your retina, which is the back part of your eye. This condition is called diabetic retinopathy. Diabetes also increases your risk of having glaucoma, cataracts, and other eye problems.</text><text>If you have diabetes, work with your health care provider to take good care of your eyes.</text></h2><h2 title="Diabetes and Your Eyes"><text>If you have diabetes, you may not know there is any damage to your eyes until the problem is very bad. Your provider can catch problems early if you get regular eye exams.</text><text>If your provider finds eye problems early, medicines and other treatments may help prevent them from getting worse.</text>Watch this video about:Diabetes - retinal conditions</h2><h2 title="You Need Regular Eye Exams"><text>Every year, you should have an eye exam by an eye doctor (ophthalmologist or optometrist). Choose an eye doctor who takes care of people with diabetes.</text><text>Your eye exam may include:</text><detail>Dilating your eyes to allow a good view of the entire retina. Only an eye doctor can do this exam.</detail><detail>At times, special photographs of your retina may replace the dilated eye exam. This is called digital retinal photography.</detail><text>Your eye doctor may ask you to come more or less often than once a year depending on the eye exam results and how well your blood sugar is controlled.</text></h2><h2 title="How to Prevent Eye Problems"><text>Control your blood sugar levels. High blood sugar increases your chance of having eye problems.</text><text>High blood sugar can also cause blurred vision that is not related to diabetic retinopathy. This kind of blurred vision is caused by having too much sugar and water in the lens of the eye, which is in front of the retina.</text><text>Control your blood pressure:</text><detail>Blood pressure less than 140/90 is a good goal for people with diabetes. Your provider may tell you that your pressure needs to be lower than 140/90.</detail><detail>Have your blood pressure checked often and at least twice each year.</detail><detail>If you take medicines to control your blood pressure, take them as your doctor instructs.</detail><text>Control your cholesterol levels:</text><detail>Abnormal cholesterol levels can also lead to diabetic retinopathy.</detail><detail>Your provider may prescribe medicines to help lower your LDL (bad cholesterol) and triglycerides. Take the medicines as directed.</detail><text>DO NOT smoke. If you need help quitting, ask your provider.</text><text>If you already have eye problems, ask your provider if you should avoid exercises that can strain the blood vessels in your eyes. Exercises that may make eye problems worse include:</text><detail>Weight lifting and other exercises that make you strain</detail><detail>High-impact exercise, such as football or hockey</detail></h2><h2 title="Make it Easier for Yourself at Home"><text>If your vision is affected by diabetes, make sure your home is safe enough that your chance of falling is low. Ask your provider about having a home assessment done. For people with diabetes, the combination of poor vision and nerve problems in the legs and feet can affect balance. This increases the chance of falling.</text><text>If you cannot read the labels on your medicines easily:</text><detail>Use felt tip pens to label medicine bottles, so you can read them easily.</detail><detail>Use rubber bands or clips to tell medicine bottles apart.</detail><detail>Ask someone else to give you your medicines.</detail><detail>Always read labels with a magnifying lens.</detail><detail>Use a pillbox with compartments for days of the week and times of the day, if you need to take medicines more than once a day. </detail><text>Never guess when taking your medicines. If you are unsure of your doses, talk with your doctor, nurse, or pharmacist.</text><text>Keep medicines and other household items organized in a cabinet so you know where they are.</text><text>To make foods that are on your diabetes meal plan:</text><detail>Use large-print cookbooks</detail><detail>Use a full-page magnifier</detail><detail>High-definition (HD) magnifier</detail><detail>For online recipes, use the zoom function on your keyboard to make the font bigger on your monitor</detail><detail>Ask your eye doctor about other low vision aids </detail></h2><h2 title="When to Call the Doctor"><text>Call your provider if you have any of the following:</text><detail>Cannot see well in dim light</detail><detail>Have blind spots</detail><detail>Have double vision (you see two things when there is only one)</detail><detail>Vision is hazy or blurry and you cannot focus</detail><detail>Eye pain</detail><detail>Headaches</detail><detail>Spots floating in your eyes</detail><detail>Cannot see things on the side of your field of vision</detail><detail>See shadows</detail></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>Diabetic retinopathy - care</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 5/17/2018"><text>Updated by: Brent Wisse, MD, Associate Professor of Medicine, Division of Metabolism, Endocrinology &amp;amp; Nutrition, University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle, WA.

<item><title>Diabetes and exercise </title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000083.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>Exercise is an important part of managing your diabetes. If you are obese or overweight, exercise can help you manage your weight.</text></h2><h2 title="Exercise will Help Your Diabetes"><text>Exercise can help lower your blood sugar without medicines. It reduces your risk of heart disease. Exercise can also lessen the symptoms of depression and reduce stress.</text><text>But be patient. It may take several months of regular exercising before you see changes in your health.</text></h2><h2 title="Talk to Your Doctor First"><text>Your health care provider should make sure your exercise program is safe for you. It is for most people with diabetes. Your provider may ask about symptoms, such as shortness of breath, chest pain, or leg pain that you may get when you walk upstairs or up a hill. In rare cases, your provider will order tests to make sure that you can exercise safely without damaging your heart.</text><text>If you take medicines that lower your blood sugar, exercise can make your blood sugar go too low. Talk to your provider or nurse about how to take your medicines when you exercise or how to adjust the doses to prevent low blood sugars.</text><text>Some types of vigorous exercise can make your eyes worse if you already have diabetic eye disease. Get an eye exam before starting a new exercise program.</text><text>After you start your exercise program, call your provider if you have any of the following:</text><detail>Feel faint, have chest pain, or feel short of breath when you exercise</detail><detail>Feel pain or numbness in your feet. Also call if you have sores or blisters on your feet</detail><detail>Your blood sugar gets too low or too high during or after exercising </detail></h2><h2 title="Getting Started"><text>Start with walking. If you are out of shape, start by walking for 5 to 10 minutes a day.</text><text>Try to set a goal of fast walking. You should do this for 30 to 45 minutes, at least 5 days a week. In order to lose weight, the amount of exercise may need to be greater. So do more if you can. Swimming or exercise classes are also good.</text><text>Wear a bracelet or necklace that says you have diabetes. Tell coaches and exercise partners that you have diabetes. Always have fast-acting sources of sugar with you, such as juice or hard candy. Carry a cell phone with emergency phone numbers with you, as well.</text><text>Drink plenty of water. Do this before, during, and after exercising. Try to exercise at the same time of day, for the same amount of time, and at the same level. This will make your blood sugar easier to control. If your schedule is less regular, exercising at different times of the day is still better than not exercising at all.</text><text>Try to avoid sitting for more than 30 minutes at a time. Get up and stretch. Walk or do some quick exercises like lunges, squats, or wall push-ups.</text></h2><h2 title="Your Blood Sugar and Exercise"><text>Check your blood sugar before you exercise. Also, check it during exercise if you are working out for more than 45 minutes.</text><text>Check your blood sugar again right after exercise, and later on. Exercise can cause your blood sugar to drop for up to 12 hours after you are done.</text><text>If you use insulin, ask your provider when and what you should eat before you exercise. Also, find out how to adjust your dose when you exercise.</text><text>DO NOT inject insulin in a part of your body that you are exercising, such as the shoulders or thighs.</text><text>Keep a snack nearby that can raise your blood sugar quickly. Examples are:</text><detail>Five or six small hard candies</detail><detail>One tablespoon (tbsp), or 15 grams, of sugar, plain or dissolved in water</detail><detail>One tbsp, or 15 milliliters (mL) of honey or syrup</detail><detail>Three or four glucose tablets</detail><detail>One half of a 12-ounce can (177 mL) of regular, non-diet soda or sports drink</detail><detail>One half cup (4 ounces or 125 mL) of fruit juice</detail><text>Have a larger snack if you will be exercising more than usual. You can also have more frequent snacks. You may need to adjust your medicine if you are planning unusual exercise.</text><text>If exercise frequently causes your blood sugar to be low, talk with your provider. You may need to lower the dose of your medicine.</text></h2><h2 title="Your Feet and Exercise"><text>Always check your feet and shoes for any problems before and after exercise. You might not feel pain in your feet because of your diabetes. You may not notice a sore or blister on your foot. Call your provider if you notice any changes on your feet. Small problems can become serious if they go untreated.</text><text>Wear socks that keep moisture away from your feet. Also, wear comfortable, well-fitting shoes.</text></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>Exercise - diabetes; Exercise - type 1 diabetes; Exercise - type 2 diabetes</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 5/17/2018"><text>Updated by: Brent Wisse, MD, Associate Professor of Medicine, Division of Metabolism, Endocrinology &amp;amp; Nutrition, University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle, WA.

<item><title>Diabetes - when you are sick</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000079.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>Waiting too long to get medical care when you are sick can lead to getting much sicker. When you have diabetes, a delay in getting care can be life threatening. Even a minor cold can make your diabetes harder to control. Uncontrolled diabetes can lead to more serious health problems.</text></h2><h2 title="What to Expect at Home"><text>When you are sick, keep a close watch on diabetes warning signs. These are:</text><detail>High blood sugar that will not come down with treatment</detail><detail>Nausea and vomiting</detail><detail>Low blood sugar that will not rise after you eat</detail><detail>Confusion or changes in how you normally behave</detail><text>If you have any of these warning signs and cannot treat them yourself, call your health care provider right away. Make sure your family members also know the warning signs.</text></h2><h2 title="Sick-day Plan"><text>Check your blood sugar more often than usual (every 2 to 4 hours). Try to keep your blood sugar at less than 200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L). There may be times when you need to check your blood sugar every hour. Write down all your blood sugar levels, the time of each test, and the medicines you have taken.</text><text>If you have type 1 diabetes, check your urine ketones every time you urinate.</text><text>Eat small meals often. Even if you are not eating as much, your blood sugar can still get very high. If you use insulin, you may even need extra insulin injections or higher doses.</text><text>DO NOT do vigorous exercise when you are sick.</text><text>If you take insulin, you should also have a glucagon emergency treatment kit prescribed by your doctor. Always have this kit available.</text></h2><h2 title="Drink Lots of Fluids"><text>Drink plenty of sugar-free fluids to keep your body from getting dried out (dehydrated). Drink at least twelve 8-ounce (oz) cups (3 liters) of fluid a day.</text><text>Fluids you can drink if you are dehydrated include:</text><detail>Water</detail><detail>Club soda</detail><detail>Diet soda (caffeine-free)</detail><detail>Tomato juice</detail><detail>Chicken broth</detail><text>If your blood sugar is less than 100 mg/dL (5.5 mmol/L) or falling quickly, it is OK to drink fluids that have sugar in them. Try to check their effect on your blood sugar in the same way you check how other foods affect your blood sugar.</text><text>Fluids you can drink if your blood sugar is low include:</text><detail>Apple juice</detail><detail>Orange juice</detail><detail>Grapefruit juice</detail><detail>Sports drink</detail><detail>Tea with honey</detail><detail>Lemon-lime drinks</detail><detail>Ginger ale</detail><text>If you throw up, DO NOT drink or eat anything for 1 hour. Rest, but DO NOT lie flat. After 1 hour, take sips of soda, such as ginger ale, every 10 minutes. If vomiting persists call or see your provider.</text></h2><h2 title="Eating When You are Sick"><text>When you have an upset stomach, try to eat small meals. Try carbohydrates, such as:</text><detail>Bagels or bread</detail><detail>Cooked cereal</detail><detail>Mashed potatoes</detail><detail>Noodle or rice soup</detail><detail>Saltines</detail><detail>Fruit-flavored gelatin</detail><detail>Graham crackers </detail><text>Many foods have the right amount of carbohydrates (about 15 grams) for your sick-day diet. Remember, on sick days it is OK to eat some foods you might not normally eat, if you cannot eat your regular foods. Some foods to try are:</text><detail>One half cup (120 milliliters, mL) apple juice</detail><detail>One half cup (120 mL) regular soft drink (non-diet, caffeine free)</detail><detail>One fruit-flavored frozen pop (1 stick)</detail><detail>Five small hard candies</detail><detail>One slice of dry toast</detail><detail>One half cup (120 mL) cooked cereal</detail><detail>Six saltine crackers</detail><detail>One half cup (120 mL) frozen yogurt</detail><detail>One cup (240 mL) sports drink</detail><detail>One half cup (120 mL) regular ice cream (if you are not throwing up)</detail><detail>One quarter cup (60 mL) sherbet</detail><detail>One quarter cup (60 mL) regular pudding (if you are not throwing up)</detail><detail>One half cup (120 mL) regular fruit-flavored gelatin</detail><detail>One cup (240 mL) yogurt (not frozen), sugar-free or plain</detail><detail>Milkshake made with one half cup (120 mL) low-fat milk and one quarter cup (60 mL) ice cream mixed in a blender (if you are not throwing up) </detail><text>When you are sick, you should try to eat the same amount of carbohydrates that you normally do. If possible, follow your regular diet. If you are having a hard time swallowing, eat soft foods.</text><text>If you have already taken your insulin and are sick to your stomach, drink enough liquids with the same amount of carbohydrates that you would normally eat. If you cannot keep food or liquids down, go to the emergency room for treatment. You will receive intravenous (IV) fluids.</text><text>If you have a cold, talk with your provider.</text></h2><h2 title="Diabetes Medicines"><text>Most of the time, you should take all of your medicines as you usually do. DO NOT skip or double up on any medicine unless your provider tells you to.</text><text>If you cannot eat your normal amount of carbohydrates, call your provider. You may need to make a change in your insulin dose or in the dose of your diabetes pills or other injections. You may also need to do this if your illness is making your blood sugar higher than normal.</text></h2><h2 title="When to Call the Doctor"><text>Call your provider if you have:</text><detail>Blood sugar higher than 240 mg/dL (13.3 mmol/L) for more than 1 day</detail><detail>Moderate-to-large ketones with your urine tests</detail><detail>Vomiting or diarrhea for more than 4 hours</detail><detail>Any severe pain or chest pain</detail><detail>A fever of 100°F (37.7°C) or higher</detail><detail>Trouble moving your arms or legs</detail><detail>Vision, speech, or balance problems</detail><detail>Confusion or new memory problems </detail><text>If your provider does not call back right away, you may need to go to the emergency room.

<item><title>Diabetes - taking care of your feet</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000081.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>Diabetes can damage the nerves and blood vessels in your feet. This damage can cause numbness and reduce feeling in your feet. As a result, your feet may not heal well if they are injured. If you get a blister, you may not notice and it may get worse. Even small sores or blisters can become big problems if infection develops or they don't heal. A diabetic foot ulcer can result. Foot ulcers are a common reason for hospital stays for people with diabetes. Taking good care of your feet can help prevent diabetic foot ulcers.</text></h2><h2 title="Self-care"><text>Follow your health care provider's instructions on how to take care of your feet. Use the information below as a reminder.</text><text>Check your feet every day. Inspect the tops, sides, soles, heels, and between your toes. Look for:</text><detail>Dry and cracked skin</detail><detail>Blisters or sores</detail><detail>Bruises or cuts</detail><detail>Redness, warmth, or tenderness</detail><detail>Firm or hard spots </detail><text>If you cannot see well, ask someone else to check your feet.</text><text>Wash your feet every day with lukewarm water and mild soap. Strong soaps may damage the skin.</text><detail>Check the temperature of the water with your hand or elbow first.</detail><detail>Gently dry your feet, especially between the toes.</detail><detail>Use lotion, petroleum jelly, lanolin, or oil on dry skin. DO NOT put lotion, oil, or cream between your toes. </detail><text>Ask your provider to show you how to trim your toenails.</text><detail>Soak your feet in lukewarm water to soften your toenails before trimming.</detail><detail>Cut the nails straight across. Curved nails are more likely to become ingrown.</detail><detail>Make sure the edge of each nail does not press into the skin of the next toe. </detail><text>Your foot doctor (podiatrist) can trim your toenails if you are unable to. If your toenails are thick and discolored (fungal infection) do not trim the nails yourself. If your vision is poor or you have decreased sensation in your feet, you should see a podiatrist to trim your toenails.</text><text>Most people with diabetes should have corns or calluses treated by a foot doctor. If your doctor has given you permission to treat corns or calluses on your own:</text><detail>Gently use a pumice stone to remove corns and calluses after a shower or bath, when your skin is soft.</detail><detail>Don't use medicated pads or try to shave or cut corns and calluses away at home. </detail><text>If you smoke, stop. Smoking decreases blood flow to your feet. Talk to your provider or nurse if you need help quitting.</text><text>Do not use a heating pad or hot water bottle on your feet. Don't walk barefoot, particularly on hot pavement or hot, sandy beaches. Remove your shoes and socks during visits to your provider so that they can check your feet.</text></h2><h2 title="Shoes and Socks"><text>Wear shoes at all times to protect your feet from injury. Before you put them on, always check the inside of your shoes for stones, nails, or rough areas that may hurt your feet.</text><text>Wear shoes that are comfortable and fit well when you buy them. Never buy shoes that are tight, not even it you think they will stretch as you wear them. You may not feel pressure from shoes that DO NOT fit well. Blisters and sores can develop when your foot presses against your shoe.</text><text>Ask your provider about special shoes that can give your feet more room. When you get new shoes, break them in slowly. Wear them 1 or 2 hours a day for the first 1 or 2 weeks.</text><text>Change your broken-in shoes after 5 hours during the day to change the pressure points on your feet. DO NOT wear flip-flop sandals or stockings with seams. Both can cause pressure points.</text><text>To protect your feet, wear clean, dry socks or non-binding panty hose every day. Holes in socks or stockings can put damaging pressure on your toes.</text><text>You may want special socks with extra padding. Socks that move moisture away from your feet will keep your feet drier. In cold weather, wear warm socks, and DO NOT stay out in the cold for very long. Wear clean, dry socks to bed if your feet are cold.</text></h2><h2 title="When to Call the Doctor"><text>Call your provider right way about any foot problems you have. Do not try to treat these problems yourself. Call your provider if you have any of the following changes to any part of your foot:</text><detail>Redness, increased warmth, or swelling</detail><detail>Sores or cracks</detail><detail>Tingling or burning feeling</detail><detail>Pain</detail></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>Diabetes - foot care - self-care; Diabetic foot ulcer - foot care; Diabetic neuropathy - foot care</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 5/17/2018"><text>Updated by: Brent Wisse, MD, Associate Professor of Medicine, Division of Metabolism, Endocrinology &amp;amp; Nutrition, University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle, WA.

<item><title>Diabetes - preventing heart attack and stroke</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000080.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>People with diabetes have a higher chance of having heart attacks and strokes than those without diabetes. Smoking and having high blood pressure and high cholesterol increase these risks even more. Controlling blood sugar, blood pressure, and cholesterol levels are very important for preventing heart attacks and strokes.</text><text>See your doctor who treats your diabetes as often as instructed. During these visits, health care providers will check your cholesterol, blood sugar, and blood pressure. You may also be instructed to take medicines.</text></h2><h2 title="Lower Your Risks"><text>You can lower your chance of having a heart attack or a stroke by being active or exercising every day. For instance, a daily 30-minute walk each day can help lower your risks.</text><text>Other things you can do to lower your risks are:</text><detail>Follow your meal plan and watch how much you eat. This can help you lose weight if you are overweight or obese.</detail><detail>DO NOT smoke cigarettes. Talk with your doctor if you need help quitting. Also avoid exposure to cigarette smoke.</detail><detail>Take your medicines the way your providers recommend.</detail><detail>Don't miss doctor appointments. </detail></h2><h2 title="Blood Sugar"><text>Good control of blood sugar can lower your risk of heart disease and stroke. Some diabetes medicines may have a better effect than others in reducing the risk of heart attacks and strokes.</text><text>If you have had a heart attack or stroke, you are at high risk of having another heart attack or stroke. Talk to your provider to see if you are on the diabetes medicines that offer the best protection from heart attack and stroke.</text></h2><h2 title="Cholesterol "><text>When you have extra cholesterol in your blood, it can build up inside the walls of your heart's arteries (blood vessels). This buildup is called plaque. It can narrow your arteries and reduces or stops blood flow. The plaque is also unstable and can suddenly rupture and cause a blood clot. This is what causes a heart attack, stroke, or other serious heart disease.</text><text>Most people with diabetes are prescribed a medicine to reduce their LDL cholesterol levels. Medicines called statins are often used. You should learn how to take your statin medicine and how to watch for side effects. Your doctor will tell you if there is a target LDL level you need to aim for.</text><text>If you have other risk factors for heart disease or stroke, your doctor may prescribe higher doses of a statin drug.</text><text>Your doctor should check your cholesterol levels at least once a year.</text><text>Eat foods that are low in fat and learn how to shop for and cook foods that are healthy for your heart.</text><text>Get plenty of exercise, as well. Talk with your doctor about what kinds of exercises are right for you.</text></h2><h2 title="Blood Pressure "><text>Have your blood pressure checked often. Your provider should check your blood pressure at every visit. For most people with diabetes, a good blood pressure goal is a systolic (top number) blood pressure between 130 to 140 mm Hg, and a diastolic blood pressure (bottom number) less than 90 mm Hg. Ask your doctor what is best for you.</text><text>Exercising, eating low-salt foods, and losing weight (if you are overweight or obese) can lower your blood pressure. If your blood pressure is too high, your doctor will prescribe medicines to lower it.</text></h2><h2 title="Before You Exercise"><text>Getting exercise will help you control your diabetes and make your heart stronger. Always talk with your doctor before you start a new exercise program or before you increase the amount of exercise you are doing. Some people with diabetes may have heart problems and not know it because they do not have symptoms.</text></h2><h2 title="Taking Aspirin May Help"><text>Taking aspirin every day may lower your chance of having a heart attack. The recommended dose is 81 milligrams (mg) a day. DO NOT take aspirin without talking to your doctor first.

<item><title>Diabetes - keeping active </title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000084.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>If you have diabetes, you may think that only vigorous exercise is helpful. But this is not true. Increasing your daily activity by any amount can help improve your health. And there are a lot of ways to add more activity to your day.</text></h2><h2 title="Introduction"><text>There are many benefits to being active. Staying active can:</text><detail>Help control your blood sugar</detail><detail>Help control your weight</detail><detail>Keep your heart, lungs, and blood vessels healthy </detail></h2><h2 title="Staying Active at Home"><text>One of the best things you can do is get up and start moving. Any activity is better than no activity.</text><text>Clean the house. Walk around when you are on the phone. Take frequent, short breaks at least every 30 minutes to get up and walk around when using the computer.</text><text>Get outside of your house and do chores, such as gardening, raking leaves, or washing the car. Play outside with your kids or grandchildren. Take the dog for a walk.</text></h2><h2 title="Staying Active Outside the Home"><text>For many people with diabetes, an activity program outside the home is a great option.</text><detail>Talk to your health care provider about your plans and discuss what activities are right for you.</detail><detail>Visit the gym or a fitness facility and have an instructor show you how to use the equipment. Pick a gym that has an atmosphere you enjoy and gives you a number of options in terms of activities and locations.</detail><detail>When the weather is cold or wet, stay active by walking around in places like a mall.</detail><detail>Make sure you are using the right shoes and equipment.</detail><detail>Start slowly. A common mistake is to try and do too much too quickly. This can result in muscle and joint injury.</detail><detail>Involve friends or family. Activity in a group or with partners is usually more fun and motivating.</detail></h2><h2 title="Shopping, Running Errands, and Working"><text>When you run errands:</text><detail>Walk as much as you can.</detail><detail>If you do drive, park your car in the farthest part of the parking lot.</detail><detail>DO NOT use drive-up windows. Get out of your car and walk inside the restaurant or retailer.</detail><text>At work:</text><detail>Walk over to your co-workers instead of calling, texting, or sending them emails.</detail><detail>Take the stairs instead of the elevator -- start with 1 floor up or 2 floors down and try to increase over time.</detail><detail>Stand up and move around while making phone calls.</detail><detail>Stretch or walk around instead of taking a coffee break or snacking.</detail><detail>During lunch, walk to the bank or post office, or do other errands that allow you to move around.</detail><text>At the end of your commute, get off the train or bus one stop earlier and walk the rest of the way to work or home.</text><text>If you want to find out how much activity you are getting during the day, use a wearable activity monitor or a step counting device, called a pedometer. Once you know how many steps you average in a day, try to take more steps each day. Your goal for better health should be around 10,000 steps a day, or progressively more steps than you took the day before.</text></h2><h2 title="Health Risks"><text>There are some health risks to beginning new activity programs. Always check with your provider before getting started.</text><text>People with diabetes are at increased risk of having heart problems. They don't always sense the warning signs of a heart attack. Ask your doctor if you need to be screened for heart disease, particularly if you:</text><detail>Also have high blood pressure</detail><detail>Also have high cholesterol</detail><detail>Smoke</detail><detail>Have a history of heart disease in your family </detail><text>People with diabetes who are overweight or obese are at higher risk of having arthritis or other joint problems. Talk to your provider if you have had joint pain with activity in the past.</text><text>Some people who are obese may develop skin rashes when they start new exercises. These can often be prevented by choosing the right clothing. If you develop a skin infection or rash, often in skin folds, talk to your provider and make sure it is treated before you continue being active.</text><text>People with diabetes and nerve damage in their feet need to be extra careful when starting new activities. Check your feet daily for redness, blisters, or calluses that are starting to form. Always wear socks. Check your socks and shoes for rough spots, which can cause blisters or ulcers. Make sure your toenails are trimmed.</text><text>Some types of vigorous exercise can damage your eyes if you already have diabetic eye disease. Get an eye exam before starting a new exercise program.</text></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>Physical activity - diabetes; Exercise - diabetes</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 5/17/2018"><text>Updated by: Brent Wisse, MD, Associate Professor of Medicine, Division of Metabolism, Endocrinology &amp;amp; Nutrition, University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle, WA.

<item><title>Diabetes - foot ulcers</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000077.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>If you have diabetes, you have an increased chance of developing foot sores, or ulcers, also called diabetic ulcers.</text><text>Foot ulcers are a common reason for hospital stays for people with diabetes. It may take weeks or even several months for foot ulcers to heal. Diabetic ulcers are often painless.</text><text>Whether or not you have a foot ulcer, you will need to learn more about taking care of your feet.</text></h2><h2 title="What to Expect at Home"><text>Diabetes can damage the nerves and blood vessels in your feet. This damage can cause numbness and reduce feeling in your feet. As a result, your feet may not heal well if they are injured. If you get a blister, you may not notice and it may get worse.</text><text>If you have developed an ulcer, follow your health care provider's instructions on how to treat the ulcer. Also follow instructions on how to take care of your feet to prevent ulcers in the future. Use the information below as a reminder.</text></h2><h2 title="Debridement"><text>One way to treat an ulcer is debridement. This treatment removes dead skin and tissue. A provider, such as a podiatrist, will need to do this to be able to see your foot ulcer. There are many ways to do this. One way is to use a scalpel and special scissors. </text><detail>The skin surrounding the wound is cleaned and disinfected. </detail><detail>The wound is probed with a metal instrument to see how deep it is and to see if there is any foreign material or object in the ulcer.</detail><detail>The provider cuts away the dead tissue, then washes out the ulcer.</detail><detail>Afterward, the sore may seem bigger and deeper. The ulcer should be red or pink and look like fresh meat. </detail><text>Other ways the provider may use to remove dead or infected tissue are:</text><detail>Put your foot in a whirlpool bath.</detail><detail>Use a syringe and catheter (tube) to wash away dead tissue.</detail><detail>Apply wet to dry dressings to the area to pull off dead tissue.</detail><detail>Put special chemicals, called enzymes, on your ulcer. These dissolve dead tissue from the wound.</detail><detail>Put special maggots on the ulcer. The maggots eat only the dead skin and produce chemicals that help the ulcer heal. </detail></h2><h2 title="Taking Pressure Off Your Foot Ulcer"><text>Foot ulcers are partly caused by too much pressure on one part of your foot.</text><text>Your provider may ask you to wear special shoes, or a brace or a special cast. You may need to use a wheelchair or crutches until the ulcer has healed. These devices will take the pressure off of the ulcer area. This will help speed healing.</text><text>Be sure to wear shoes that do not put a lot of pressure on only one part of your foot.</text><detail>Wear shoes made of canvas, leather, or suede. Don't wear shoes made of plastic or other materials that do not allow air to pass in and out of the shoe.</detail><detail>Wear shoes you can adjust easily. They should have laces, Velcro, or buckles.</detail><detail>Wear shoes that fit properly and are not too tight. You may need a special shoe made to fit your foot.</detail><detail>Don't wear shoes with pointed or open toes, such as high heels, flip-flops, or sandals. </detail></h2><h2 title="Wound Care and Dressings"><text>Care for your wound as instructed by your provider. You'll likely be told to:</text><detail>Keep your blood sugar level under good control. This helps you heal faster and helps your body fight infections.</detail><detail>Keep the ulcer clean and bandaged.</detail><detail>Cleanse the wound daily, using a wound dressing or bandage.</detail><detail>Try to reduce pressure on the healing ulcer.</detail><detail>Don't walk barefoot unless your provider tells you it is OK. </detail><text>Your provider may use different kinds of dressings to treat your ulcer.</text><text>Wet-to-dry dressings are often used first. This process involves applying a wet dressing to your wound. As the dressing dries, it absorbs wound material. When the dressing is removed, some of the tissue comes off with it.</text><detail>Your provider will tell you how often you need to change the dressing.</detail><detail>You may be able to change your own dressing, or family members may be able to help.</detail><detail>A visiting nurse may also help you. </detail><text>Other types of dressings are:</text><detail>Dressing that contains medicine</detail><detail>Skin substitutes </detail><text>Keep your dressing and the skin around it dry. Try not to get healthy tissue around your wound too wet from your dressings. This can soften the healthy tissue and cause more foot problems.</text></h2><h2 title="When to Call the Doctor"><text>Call your provider if you have any of these signs and symptoms of infection:</text><detail>Redness, increased warmth, or swelling around the wound</detail><detail>Extra drainage</detail><detail>Pus</detail><detail>Odor</detail><detail>Fever or chills</detail><detail>Increased pain</detail><detail>Increased firmness around the wound </detail><text>Also call if your foot ulcer is very white, blue, or black.</text></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>Diabetic foot ulcer; Ulcer - foot</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 5/17/2018"><text>Updated by: Brent Wisse, MD, Associate Professor of Medicine, Division of Metabolism, Endocrinology &amp;amp; Nutrition, University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle, WA.

<item><title>Devices for hearing loss</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000359.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>If you are living with hearing loss, you know that it takes extra effort to communicate with others.</text><text>There are many different devices that can improve your ability to communicate. This can help reduce stress for you and those around you. These devices can improve your life in numerous ways.</text><detail>You can avoid becoming socially isolated.</detail><detail>You can remain more independent.</detail><detail>You can be safer wherever you are. </detail></h2><h2 title="Hearing aids"><text>A hearing aid is a small electronic device that fits in your ear or behind it. It amplifies sounds so that you are better able to communicate and participate in everyday activities. A hearing aid has three parts. The sounds is received through a microphone which converts the sound waves into electric signals that are sent to an amplifier. The amplifier increases the strength of the signals and transmits them into the ear through a speaker. </text><text>There are three styles of hearing aids:</text><detail>Behind-the-ear (BTE). The electronic components of the hearing aid are contained in a hard plastic case that is worn behind the ear. It is connected to an ear mold that fits into the outer ear. The earmold projects sound from the hearing aid into the ear. In the newer style open-fit hearing aids, the behind-the-ear unit doesn't use an earmold. Instead it is connected to a narrow tube that fits into the ear canal.</detail><detail>In-the-ear (ITE). With this type of hearing aid, the hard plastic case holding the electronics fits completely inside the outer ear. ITE hearing aids may use an electronic coil called a telecoil to receive sound rather than a microphone. This makes hearing over the telephone easier.</detail><detail>Canal hearing aids. These hearing aids are made to fit the size and shape of the person's ear. Completely-in-canal (CIC) devices are mostly hidden in the ear canal. </detail><text>An audiologist will help you choose the proper device for your hearing needs and lifestyle.</text></h2><h2 title="Assistive Listening Devices"><text>When many sounds are all mixed together in a room, it is harder to pick up the sounds you want to hear. Assistive technology helps people with hearing loss understand what is being said and communicate more easily. These devices bring certain sounds directly to your ears. This can improve your hearing in one-on-one conversations or in classrooms or theaters. Many listening devices now work through a wireless link and can connect directly to your hearing aid or cochlear implant.</text><text>Types of assistive listening devices include:</text><detail>Hearing loop. This technology involves a thin loop of wire that circles a room. A sound source such as a microphone, public address system, or home TV or telephone transmits amplified sound through the loop. The electromagnetic energy from the loop is picked up by a receiving device in the hearing loop receiver or a telecoil in a hearing aid.</detail><detail>FM systems. This technology is often used in classroom. It uses radio signals to send amplified sounds from a small microphone worn by the instructor, which is picked up by a receiver the student wears. The sound can also be transmitted to a telecoil in a hearing aid or cochlear implant by way of a neck loop the person wears.</detail><detail>Infrared systems. Sound is converted in to light signals which are sent to a receiver that the listener wears. As with FM stems, people who have hearing aids or an implant with a telecoil can pick up the signal via a neck loop.</detail><detail>Personal amplifiers. These units consist of a small box about the size of a cell phone that amplifies sound and reduces background noise for the listener. Some have microphones that can be placed near the sound source. The enhanced sound is picked up by a receiver such as a headset or ear buds. </detail></h2><h2 title="Alerting Devices"><text>Alerting devices help make you aware of sounds, such as the doorbell or a ringing phone. They can also alert you to things happening nearby, such as a fire, someone entering your home, or your baby's activity. These devices send you a signal that you can recognize. The signal may be a flashing light, a horn, or a vibration.</text></h2><h2 title="Devices for the Telephone"><text>There are many tools that can help you listen and talk on the telephone. Devices called amplifiers make sound louder. Some phones have amplifiers built-in. You can also attach an amplifier to your phone. Some can be carried with you, so you can use them with any phone.</text><text>Some amplifiers are held next to the ear. Many hearing aids work with these devices but may require special settings.</text><text>Other devices make it easier to use your hearing aid with a digital phone line. This helps prevent some distortion.</text><text>Telecommunication relay services (TRS) allow people with severe hearing loss to place calls to standard telephones. Text telephones, called TTYs or TTDs, allow the typing of messages through a phone line rather than using voice. If the person on the other end can hear, the typed message is relayed as a voice message.</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 4/3/2017"><text>Updated by: Josef Shargorodsky, MD, MPH, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD.

Sealants are applied to help prevent cavities.</text></h2><h2 title="Why Sealants are Used"><text>The grooves on the top of molars and premolars are deep and hard to clean with a toothbrush. Bacteria can build up in the grooves and cause cavities.</text><text>Dental sealants can help:</text><detail>Keep food, acids, and plaque from sitting in the grooves of the molars and premolars</detail><detail>Prevent decay and cavities</detail><detail>Save time, money, and the discomfort of getting a filling</detail><text>Children are most at risk for cavities on molars. Sealants can help protect permanent molars. Permanent molars come in when children are about 6 years old and then again when they are 12 years old. Getting sealants soon after the molars have come in will help protect them from cavities.</text><text>Adults who do not have cavities or decay on their molars can also get sealants.</text><text>Sealants last about 5 to 10 years. Your dentist should check them at each visit in case a sealant needs to be replaced.</text></h2><h2 title="How Dental Sealants are Applied"><text>Your dentist applies sealants on the molars in a few quick steps. There is no drilling or scraping of the molars. Your dentist will:</text><detail>Clean the tops of the molars and premolars.</detail><detail>Put a conditioning acid gel on the top of the molar for a few seconds.</detail><detail>Rinse and dry the tooth surface.</detail><detail>Paint the sealant into the grooves of the tooth.</detail><detail>Shine a light on the sealant to help it dry and harden. This takes about 10 to 30 seconds.</detail></h2><h2 title="Cost and Insurance Coverage"><text>Ask your dental office about the cost of dental sealants. The cost of dental sealants is usually priced per tooth.</text><detail>Check with your insurance plan to see if the cost of sealants is covered.

Keep your planner or calendar in an obvious place, like beside your bed.</detail><detail>Posting messages around your home where you will see them, such as the bathroom mirror, next to the coffee pot, or on the phone.</detail><detail>Keeping a list of important phone numbers next to every phone.</detail><detail>Having clocks and calendars around the house so you stay aware of the date and what time it is.</detail><detail>Labeling important items.</detail><detail>Developing habits and routines that are easy to follow.</detail><detail>Planning activities that improve your thinking, such as puzzles, games, baking, or indoor gardening. Have someone nearby for any tasks that may have a risk of injury. </detail></h2><h2 title="Eating and Nutrition"><text>Some people who have dementia may refuse food or not eat enough to stay healthy on their own.</text><detail>Help the person get enough exercise. Ask them to go outside with you for a walk.</detail><detail>Have someone the person likes, such as a friend or relative, prepare and serve them food.</detail><detail>Reduce distractions around the eating area, such as the radio or TV.</detail><detail>Do not give them foods that are too hot or too cold.</detail><detail>Give the person finger foods if they have problems using utensils.</detail><detail>Try different foods. It is common for people who have dementia to have decreased smell and taste. This will affect their enjoyment of food. </detail><text>In later stages of dementia, the person may have trouble chewing or swallowing. Talk with the person's health care provider about a proper diet. At some point, the person may need a diet of only liquid or soft foods, to prevent choking.</text></h2><h2 title="Tips for Talking With Someone With Dementia"><text>Keep distractions and noise down:</text><detail>Turn off the radio or TV</detail><detail>Close the curtains</detail><detail>Move to a quieter room</detail><text>To avoid surprising the person, try to make eye contact before touching or speaking to them.</text><text>Use simple words and sentences, and speak slowly. Speak in a quiet voice. Talking loudly, as if the person is hard of hearing, will not help. Repeat your words, if needed. Use names and places the person knows. Try not to use pronouns, such as "he," "she," and "them." This can confuse someone with dementia. Tell them when you are going to change the subject.</text><text>Talk to people who have dementia as adults. Don't make them feel as if they are children. And don't pretend to understand them if you do not.</text><text>Ask questions so they can answer with "yes" or "no." Give the person clear choices, and a visual cue, such as pointing to something, if possible. Don't give them too many options.</text><text>When giving instructions:</text><detail>Break directions down into small and simple steps.</detail><detail>Allow time for the person to understand.</detail><detail>If they get frustrated, consider switching to another activity.</detail><text>Try to get them talking about something they enjoy. Many people with dementia like to talk about the past, and many can remember the distant past better than recent events. Even if they remember something wrong, do not insist on correcting them.</text></h2><h2 title="Personal Grooming"><text>People with dementia may need help with personal care and grooming.</text><text>Their bathroom should be nearby and easy to find. Consider leaving the bathroom door open, so they can see it. Suggest that they visit the bathroom several times a day.</text><text>Make sure their bathroom is warm. Get them undergarments made for urine or stool leakage. Make sure they are cleaned well after going to the bathroom. Be gentle when helping. Try to respect their dignity.</text><text>Make sure the bathroom is safe. Common safety devices are:</text><detail>A tub or shower seat</detail><detail>Handrails</detail><detail>Anti-skid mats</detail><text>Do not let them use razors with blades. Electric razors are best for shaving. Remind the person to brush their teeth at least 2 times a day.</text><text>A person with dementia should have clothing that is easy to put on and take off.</text><detail>Do not give them too many choices about what to wear.</detail><detail>Velcro is much easier than buttons and zippers to use. If they still wear clothes with buttons and zippers, they should be in the front.</detail><detail>Get them pullover clothes and slip on shoes, as their dementia gets worse.</detail></h2><h2 title="Review Date 4/30/2018"><text>Updated by: Amit M.

If you are using a hospital bed that has guard rails in the home, putting the rails up may help keep the person from wandering at night.</text><text>Always talk with the person's health care provider before giving them store-bought sleep medicines. Many sleep aids can make confusion worse.</text><text>If the person with dementia has hallucinations (sees things that are not there):</text><detail>Try to decrease the stimulation around them. Help them avoid things with bright colors or bold patterns.</detail><detail>Make sure there is enough light so that there are no shadows in the room. But DO NOT make rooms so bright that there is a glare.</detail><detail>Help them avoid movies or television shows that are violent or action-packed. </detail><text>Take the person to places where they can move around and exercise during the day, such as shopping malls.</text><text>If the person who has dementia has an angry outburst, try not to touch or restrain them -- only do so if you need to for safety. If possible, try to stay calm and distract the person during outbursts. Do not take their behavior personally. Call 911 if you or the person with dementia is in danger.</text><text>Try to prevent them from getting hurt if they start wandering.</text><text>Also, try to keep the person's home stress-free.</text><detail>Keep lighting low, but not so low that there are shadows.</detail><detail>Take down mirrors or cover them.</detail><detail>DO NOT use bare light bulbs. </detail></h2><h2 title="When to Call the Doctor"><text>Call the person's provider if:</text><detail>You think medicines may be the cause of changes in the behavior of the person who has dementia.</detail><detail>You think the person may not be safe at home. </detail></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>Sundowning - care</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 4/30/2018"><text>Updated by: Amit M.

<item><title>Delivery presentations</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000621.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>Delivery presentation describes the way the baby is positioned to come down the birth canal for delivery.</text><text>Your baby must pass through your pelvic bones to reach the vaginal opening. The ease at which this passage will take place depends on how your baby is positioned during delivery. The best position for the baby to be in to pass through the pelvis is with the head down and the body facing towards the mother's back. This position is called occiput anterior (OA).</text><text>In breech position, the baby's bottom is facing down instead of the head. Your health care provider will most often detect this in an office visit before your labor begins. Most babies will be in the head-down position by about 34 weeks.</text><text>Part of your prenatal care after 34 weeks will involve making sure your baby is in the head-down position.</text><text>If your baby is breech, it is not safe to deliver vaginally. If your baby is not in a head-down position after your 36th week, your provider can explain your choices and their risks to help you decide what steps to take next.</text></h2><h2 title="Occiput Posterior (OP)"><text>In occiput posterior position, your baby's head is down, but it is facing the mother's front instead of her back.</text><text>It is safe to deliver a baby facing this way. But it is harder for the baby to get through the pelvis. If a baby is in this position, sometimes it will rotate around during labor so that the head stays down and the body faces the mother's back (OA position).</text><text>The mother can walk, rock, and try different delivery positions during labor to help encourage the baby to turn. If the baby does not turn, labor can take longer. Sometimes, the provider may use forceps or a vacuum device to help get the baby out.</text></h2><h2 title="Transverse Position"><text>A baby in the transverse position is sideways. Often, the shoulders or back are over the mother's cervix. This is also called the shoulder, or oblique, position.</text><text>The risk for having a baby in the transverse position increases if you:</text><detail>Go into labor early</detail><detail>Have given birth 5 or more times</detail><detail>Have placenta previa</detail><text>Unless your baby can be turned into head-down position, a vaginal birth will be too risky for you and your baby. A doctor will deliver your baby by cesarean birth (C-section). </text></h2><h2 title="Less Common Presentations "><text>With the brow-first position, the baby's head extends backward (like looking up), and the forehead leads the way. This position may be more common if this is not your first pregnancy.</text><detail>Your provider rarely detects this position before labor. An ultrasound may be able to confirm a brow presentation.</detail><detail>More likely, your provider will detect this position while you are in labor during an internal exam. </detail><text>With face-first position, the baby's head is extended backwards even more than with brow first position.</text><detail>Most of the time, the force of contractions causes the baby to be in face-first position.</detail><detail>It is also detected when labor does not progress. </detail><text>In some of these presentations, a vaginal birth is possible, but labor will generally take longer. After delivery, the baby's face or brow will be swollen and may appear bruised. These changes will go away over the next few days. </text></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>Pregnancy - delivery presentation; Labor - delivery presentation; Occiput posterior; Occiput anterior; Brow presentation</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 11/11/2016"><text>Updated by: Irina Burd, MD, PhD, Associate Professor of Gynecology and Obstetrics at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD.

Only careful thought can help you make a decision.</text></h2><h2 title="Who Benefits From Knee or hip Replacement Surgery?"><text>The most common reason to have a knee or hip replaced is to provide relief from severe arthritis pain that limits your activities. Your provider may recommend replacement surgery when:</text><detail>Pain prevents you from sleeping or doing normal activities.</detail><detail>You cannot move around by yourself and have to use a cane or walker.</detail><detail>Your pain has not improved with other treatment.</detail><detail>You understand the surgery and recovery involved. </detail><text>Some people are more willing to accept the limits knee or hip pain places on them.

Others will want to have joint replacement surgery in order to continue with sports and other activities they enjoy.</text><text>Knee or hip replacements are most often done in people who are 60 and older. However, many people who have this surgery are younger. When a knee or hip replacement is done, the new joint may wear out over time. This is more likely to occur in people with more active lifestyles or in those who will likely live longer after surgery. Unfortunately, if a second joint replacement is needed in the future, it may not work as well as the first.</text></h2><h2 title="Is There any Harm in Waiting?"><text>For the most part, knee and hip replacement are elective procedures. This means these surgeries are done when you are ready to seek relief for your pain, not for emergency medical reason.</text><text>In most cases, delaying surgery should not make joint replacement less effective if you choose to have it in the future. In some cases, the provider may strongly recommend surgery if deformity or extreme wear and tear on the joint affects other parts of your body.</text><text>Also, if pain is preventing you from moving around well, the muscles around your joints may become weaker and your bones may become thinner. This may affect your recovery time if you have surgery at a later date.</text></h2><h2 title="Why you may not be Able to Have Replacement Surgery"><text>Your provider may recommend against knee or hip replacement surgery if you have any of the following:</text><detail>Extreme obesity (weighing over 300 pounds or 135 kilograms)</detail><detail>Weak quadriceps, the muscles in the front of your thighs, that can make it very hard for you to walk and use your knee</detail><detail>Unhealthy skin around the joint</detail><detail>Previous infection of your knee or hip</detail><detail>Previous surgery or injuries that do not allow for a successful joint replacement</detail><detail>Heart or lung problems, which make major surgery more risky</detail><detail>Other health conditions that may not allow you to recover well from joint replacement surgery </detail></h2><h2 title="Review Date 9/7/2017"><text>Updated by: C.

When considering HT, learn about how it can help you. </text></h2><h2 title="Benefits of Hormone Therapy"><text>When taking hormones, hot flashes and night sweats tend to occur less often and can even go away over time. Slowly reducing HT may make these symptoms less bothersome.</text><text>Hormone therapy can also be very helpful in relieving:</text><detail>Problems sleeping</detail><detail>Vaginal dryness</detail><detail>Anxiety</detail><detail>Moodiness and irritability </detail><text>At one time, HT was used to help prevent thinning bones (osteoporosis). That is no longer the case. Your doctor can prescribe other medicines to treat osteoporosis.</text><text>Studies show that HT does not help treat:</text><detail>Heart disease</detail><detail>Urinary incontinence</detail><detail>Alzheimer disease</detail><detail>Dementia </detail></h2><h2 title="Risks of Hormone Therapy"><text>Be sure to talk with your doctor about the risks for HT. These risks may be different depending on your age, medical history, and other factors.</text><text>BLOOD CLOTS</text><text>Taking HT may increase your risk for blood clots. Your risk for blood clots is also higher if you are obese or if you smoke. </text><text>Your risk for blood clots may be lower if you use estrogen skin patches instead of pills. </text><text>Your risk is lower if you use vaginal creams and tablets and the low-dose estrogen ring. </text><text>BREAST CANCER</text><detail>Most experts believe that taking HT for up to 5 years does not increase your risk for breast cancer.</detail><detail>Taking estrogen and progestin together for longer than 3 to 5 years may increase your risk for breast cancer, depending on the type of progestin you are prescribed.</detail><detail>Taking HT can make the mammogram image of your breasts look cloudy. This can make it hard to find breast cancer early.</detail><detail>Taking estrogen alone does not carry as high a risk for breast cancer as estrogen and progestin together. </detail><text>ENDOMETRIAL (UTERINE) CANCER</text><detail>Taking estrogen alone increases your risk for endometrial cancer.</detail><detail>Taking progestin with estrogen protects against this cancer. If you have a uterus, you should take HT with both estrogen and progestin.</detail><detail>You cannot get endometrial cancer if you do not have a uterus. It is safe and recommended to use estrogen alone in this case. </detail><text>HEART DISEASE</text><text>HT is safest when taken before age 60 or within 10 years after starting menopause. </text><detail>HT may increase the risk of developing heart disease in older women.</detail><detail>HT may increase the risk in women who began using estrogen more than 10 years after their last period. </detail><text>STROKE</text><text>Women who take only estrogen and who take estrogen with progestin have an increased risk for stroke. Using the estrogen patch instead of an oral pill decreases this risk. However, risk may still be increased compared to not taking any hormones at all. Lower HT dosage also reduces the risk for stroke.</text><text>GALLSTONES</text><text>Taking HT may increase your risk of developing gallstones.</text><text>RISK OF DYING (MORTALITY)</text><text>Overall mortality is reduced in women who begin HT in their 50s. The protection lasts for about 10 years.</text></h2><h2 title="Making a Decision"><text>Every woman is different. Some women aren't bothered by menopause symptoms. For others, symptoms are severe and affect their lives significantly.</text><text>If menopause symptoms bother you, talk to your doctor about the benefits and risks for HT. You and your doctor can decide if HT is right for you. Your doctor should know your medical history before prescribing HT.</text><text>You should not take HT if you:</text><detail>Have had a stroke or heart attack</detail><detail>Have a history of blood clots in your veins or lungs</detail><detail>Have had breast or endometrial cancer</detail><detail>Have liver disease</detail><text>Certain lifestyle changes can help you adjust to the changes of menopause without taking hormones. They can also help protect your bones, improve your heart health, and help you stay fit.</text><text>However, for many women, taking HT is a safe way to treat menopause symptoms.</text><text>Currently, experts are unclear on how long you should take HT. Some professional groups suggest that you can take HT for menopause symptoms for longer periods if there is no medical reason to discontinue the medicine. For many women, low doses of HT may be enough to control troublesome symptoms. Low doses of HT tend to have few side effects.</text><text>These are all issues to discuss with your health care provider.</text></h2><h2 title="When to Call the Doctor"><text>If you have vaginal bleeding or other unusual symptoms during HT, call your doctor.</text><text>Be sure to continue seeing your doctor for regular checkups.</text></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>HRT - deciding; Estrogen replacement therapy - deciding; ERT- deciding; Hormone replacement therapy - deciding; Menopause - deciding; HT - deciding; Menopausal hormone therapy - deciding; MHT - deciding</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 1/14/2018"><text>Updated by: John D.

<item><title>Dealing with chronic cancer</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000933.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>Sometimes cancer cannot be fully treated. This means there is no way to get rid of the cancer completely, yet the cancer also may not progress rapidly.</text><text>It may be possible to control the cancer for months or years. Doing so requires ongoing treatment to help keep the cancer from progressing for as long as possible. Therefore, it becomes more like a chronic illness.</text></h2><h2 title="Cancer That Won't Go Away"><text>Certain types of cancer are more likely to become chronic and never completely go away:</text><detail>Chronic leukemia</detail><detail>Some types of lymphoma</detail><detail>Ovarian cancer</detail><detail>Breast cancer </detail><text>Often, these cancers have spread to other parts of the body (metastasized). They cannot be cured, but can often be controlled for a period of time. </text></h2><h2 title="Controlling Chronic Cancer"><text>When you have a chronic cancer, the focus is on keeping it under control, not to cure the cancer. This means keeping the tumor from getting larger or spreading to other areas. Treatment for chronic cancer can also help manage symptoms. </text><text>When cancer is not growing, it is called being in remission or having stable disease. Your health care provider will keep a close watch on the cancer to look for any growth. You may need ongoing treatment to help keep the cancer under control. This is called maintenance treatment. </text><text>If your cancer starts to grow or spread, you may need a different treatment to try to make it shrink or stop growing. Your cancer may go through several rounds of growing and shrinking. Or your cancer may not grow at all for many years. </text><text>Since each person and each cancer is different, your provider may not be able to tell you exactly how long your cancer can be controlled. </text></h2><h2 title="Treatment for Chronic Cancer"><text>Chemotherapy (chemo) or biologic therapy may be used for chronic cancers. There are many types of drugs from which to chose. If one kind does not work, or stops working, your provider may suggest using another one. </text><text>Sometimes, cancer can become resistant to all of the treatments approved to treat it. If this happens, talk with your doctor provider about your options. You may want to try another treatment, join a clinical trial, or you may decide to stop treatment. </text><text>Whatever treatment you receive, it is very important to follow your provider's instructions for taking the drug. Got to your doctor appointments as scheduled. If you have any side effects, tell your provider. There may be ways to lessen side effects. DO NOT stop taking any drug without first talking with your provider. </text></h2><h2 title="How Long to Continue Treatment"><text>There is no limit on how long you can continue treatment for chronic cancer. It is a personal decision you need to make with the help of your provider and loved ones. Your decision may depend on:</text><detail>The type of cancer you have</detail><detail>Your age</detail><detail>Your overall health</detail><detail>How you feel after treatment</detail><detail>How well the treatment works to control your cancer</detail><detail>The side effects you have with treatment </detail><text>If you do decide to stop treatment that is no longer working, you can still get palliative care or hospice care to treat the symptoms of your cancer. This will not help treat the cancer, but it can help you feel your best for the time you have left. </text></h2><h2 title="Living with Cancer"><text>It is not easy to live with a cancer you know will not go away. You may feel sad, angry, or afraid. These suggestions may help you cope:</text><detail>Do things you enjoy. This might include going to see music or theater, traveling, or fishing. Whatever it is, make time to do it.</detail><detail>Enjoy the present. Try to focus on enjoying the present instead of worrying about the future. Focus on the small things that bring you joy every day, such as spending time with family, reading a good book, or walking in the woods.</detail><detail>Share your feelings. Sharing your feelings with others may help you feel better. You can talk with a close family member or friend, join a support group, or meet with a counselor or clergy member.</detail><detail>Let go of worry. Feeling worried is normal, but try not to these thoughts take over. Acknowledge these fears and then practice letting them go. </detail></h2><h2 title="Review Date 1/31/2018"><text>Updated by: Todd Gersten, MD, Hematology/Oncology, Florida Cancer Specialists &amp;amp; Research Institute, Wellington, FL.

Ask about support groups and other stop-smoking strategies.</text><text>Even secondhand smoke can cause further damage. So ask other people not to smoke around you.</text><text>You should also avoid other forms of pollution like car exhaust and dust. On days when air pollution is high, close the windows and stay inside if you can.</text><text>Also, stay inside when it is too hot or too cold.</text></h2><h2 title="Eat Well"><text>Your diet affects COPD in several ways. Food gives you fuel to breathe. Moving air in and out of your lungs takes more work and burns more calories when you have COPD.</text><text>Your weight also affects COPD. Being overweight makes it harder to breathe. But if you are too thin, your body will have a hard time fighting illnesses.</text><text>Tips for eating well with COPD include:</text><detail>Eat small meals and snacks that give you energy, but do not leave you feeling stuffed. Large meals may make it harder for you to breathe.</detail><detail>Drink water or other liquids throughout the day. About 6 to 8 cups (1.5 to 2 liters) a day is a good goal. Drinking plenty of fluids helps thin mucus so it is easier to get rid of it.</detail><detail>Eat healthy proteins like low-fat milk and cheese, eggs, meat, fish, and nuts.</detail><detail>Eat healthy fats like olive or canola oils and soft margarine.

Being active can build your strength so you can breathe easier. It can also help you stay healthier for longer.</text><text>Talk to your provider about what kind of exercise is right for you. Then start slow. You may only be able to walk a short distance at first. Over time, you should be able to go longer.</text><text>Ask your provider about pulmonary rehabilitation. This is a formal program where specialists teach you to breathe, exercise, and live well with COPD.</text><text>Try to exercise for at least 15 minutes, 3 times a week.</text><text>If you become winded, slow down and rest.</text><text>Stop exercising and call your provider if you feel:</text><detail>Pain in your chest, neck, arm or jaw</detail><detail>Sick to your stomach</detail><detail>Dizzy or lightheaded </detail></h2><h2 title="Sleep"><text>A good night's sleep can make you feel better and keep you healthier.

The DASH diet can help lower high blood pressure and cholesterol and other fats in your blood. It can help lower your risk for heart attack and stroke and help you lose weight. This diet is low in sodium (salt) and rich in nutrients.</text></h2><h2 title="How DASH Works"><text>The DASH diet reduces high blood pressure by lowering the amount of sodium in your diet to 2300 milligrams (mg) a day. Lowering sodium to 1500 mg a day reduces blood pressure even more. It also includes variety of foods rich in nutrients that help lower blood pressure, such as potassium, calcium, and magnesium.</text><text>On the DASH diet, you will:</text><detail>Get plenty of vegetables, fruits, and fat-free or low-fat dairy</detail><detail>Include whole grains, beans, seeds, nuts, and vegetable oils</detail><detail>Eat lean meats, poultry, and fish</detail><detail>Cut back on salt, red meat, sweets, and sugary drinks</detail><detail>Limit alcoholic beverages </detail><text>You should also get at least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise most days of the week. Examples include brisk walking or riding a bike. Aim to get 2 hours and 30 minutes of exercise per week.</text><text>You can follow the DASH diet if you want to prevent high blood pressure. It can also help you lose extra weight. Most people can benefit from lowering sodium intake to 2300 milligrams (mg) a day.</text><text>Your health care provider may suggest cutting back to 1500 mg a day if you:</text><detail>Already have high blood pressure</detail><detail>Have diabetes or chronic kidney disease</detail><detail>Are African American</detail><detail>Are age 51 or older </detail><text>If you take medicine to treat high blood pressure, do not stop taking your medicine while on the DASH diet. Be sure to tell your provider you are following the DASH diet.</text></h2><h2 title="How to get Started"><text>On the DASH diet, you can eat foods from all food groups. But you eat more of the foods that are naturally low in salt, cholesterol, and saturated fats. You will also include foods that are high in potassium, calcium, magnesium, and fiber.</text><text>Here's a list of the food groups and how many servings of each you should have per day. For a diet that has 2000 calories per day, you should eat:</text><detail>Vegetables (4 to 5 servings a day)</detail><detail>Fruits (4 to 5 servings a day)</detail><detail>Low-fat or fat-free dairy products, such as milk and yogurt (2 to 3 servings a day)</detail><detail>Whole grains (7 to 8 servings a day, and 3 should be whole grains)</detail><detail>Fish, lean meats, and poultry (2 servings or less a day)</detail><detail>Beans, seeds, and nuts (4 to 5 servings a week)</detail><detail>Fats and oils (2 to 3 servings a day)</detail><detail>Sweets or added sugars, such as jelly, hard candy, maple syrup, sorbet, and sugar (fewer than 5 servings a week) </detail><text>The number of servings you have each day depends on how many calories you need.</text><detail>If you're trying to lose weight, you may need fewer servings than listed.</detail><detail>If you are not very active, aim for the lower number of servings listed.</detail><detail>If you are moderately active, have the higher number of servings.</detail><detail>If you are very active, you may need more servings than listed.</detail><text>Your provider can help find the right number of servings a day for you.</text></h2><h2 title="Know your Serving Sizes"><text>To know how much to eat, you need to know serving sizes. Below are sample servings for each food group.</text><text>Vegetables:</text><detail>1 cup (70 grams) raw leafy vegetables</detail><detail>½ cup (90 grams) chopped raw or cooked vegetables </detail><text>Fruits:</text><detail>1 medium fruit (6 ounces or 168 grams)</detail><detail>½ cup (70 grams) fresh, frozen, or canned fruit</detail><detail>¼ cup (25 grams) dried fruit </detail><text>Fat-free or low-fat dairy products:</text><detail>1 cup (240 milliliters) milk or yogurt</detail><detail>1½ ounce (oz) or 50 grams (g) cheese </detail><text>Whole grains (Aim to make all of your grain choices whole grain. Whole grain products contain more fiber and protein than "refined" grain products.):</text><detail>1 slice bread</detail><detail>½ cup (80 grams) cooked rice, pasta, or cereal </detail><text>Lean meats, poultry, and fish:</text><detail>3 oz (85 g) of cooked fish, lean meat, or poultry </detail><text>Nuts, seeds, and legumes:</text><detail>½ cup (90 grams) cooked legumes (dried beans, peas)</detail><detail>1/3 cup (45 grams) nuts</detail><detail>1 tablespoon (10 grams) seeds </detail><text>Fats and oils:</text><detail>1 teaspoon (5 milliliters) vegetable oil</detail><detail>2 tablespoons (30 grams) low-fat salad dressing</detail><detail>1 teaspoon (5 grams) soft margarine </detail><text>Sweets and added sugars:</text><detail>1 tablespoon (15 grams) sugar</detail><detail>1 tablespoon (15 grams) jelly or jam</detail><detail>½ cup (70 grams) sorbet, gelatin dessert </detail></h2><h2 title="Tips for Following DASH"><text>It's easy to follow the DASH diet. But it might mean making some changes to how you currently eat. To get started:</text><detail>DO NOT try to make changes all at once. It's fine to change your eating habits gradually.</detail><detail>To add vegetables to your diet, try having a salad at lunch. Or, add cucumber, lettuce, shredded carrots, or tomatoes to your sandwiches.</detail><detail>There should always been something green on your plate. It's fine to use frozen vegetables instead of fresh. Just make sure the package does not contain added salt or fat.</detail><detail>Add sliced fruit to your cereal or oatmeal for breakfast.</detail><detail>For dessert, choose fresh fruit or low-fat frozen yogurt instead of high-calorie sweets, such as cakes or pies.</detail><detail>Choose healthy snacks, such as unsalted rice cakes or popcorn, raw vegetables, or yogurt. Dried fruits, seeds, and nuts also make great snack choices. Just keep these portions small.</detail><detail>Think of meat as part of your meal, instead of the main course. Limit your servings of lean meat to 6 ounces (170 grams) a day. You can have two 3-ounce (85 grams) servings during the day.</detail><detail>Try cooking without meat at least twice each week. Instead, eat beans, nuts, tofu, or eggs for your protein.</detail></h2><h2 title="Tips to Lower Your Salt"><text>To lower the amount of salt in your diet:</text><detail>Take the saltshaker off the table.</detail><detail>Flavor your food with herbs and spices instead of salt. Lemon, lime, and vinegar also add flavor.</detail><detail>Avoid canned foods and frozen entrees. They are often high in salt.

<item><title>Dance your way to fitness</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000809.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>Do you think you can dance? If you are not sure, why not give it a try? Dancing is an exciting and social way to work out your body. From ballroom to salsa, dancing works your heart and helps build strong bones and muscles. Because dancing is so much fun, you may forget you are exercising.</text></h2><h2 title="Health Benefits of Dance"><text>Dancing combines the benefits of aerobic plus weight-bearing exercise. When you dance, you get many physical and mental health benefits, including:</text><detail>Better heart health</detail><detail>Stronger muscles</detail><detail>Better balance and coordination</detail><detail>Stronger bones</detail><detail>Lower risk of dementia</detail><detail>Improved memory</detail><detail>Reduced stress</detail><detail>More energy</detail><detail>Improved mood</detail></h2><h2 title="Types of Dance"><text>There are dance styles to fit almost anyone and any mood. The kind you choose may depend on what is available in your area and your own taste in dance or music. If you have danced before, you can pick up where you left off. Or you may decide to choose something new.</text><text>Here are some types of dance you may want to try:</text><detail>Salsa</detail><detail>Flamenco</detail><detail>Ballroom</detail><detail>Tap</detail><detail>Swing</detail><detail>Square dancing</detail><detail>Contra dancing</detail><detail>Belly dancing</detail><detail>Line dancing</detail><detail>Tango</detail><detail>Jazz dancing</detail><detail>Ballet</detail><detail>Modern dance</detail><detail>Hip-hop</detail><detail>Folk</detail><detail>Clogging </detail></h2><h2 title="Other Ways to Dance"><text>If traditional dance does not appeal to you, there are other ways to get moving to rhythm and music. Many health clubs and fitness centers offer dance workout classes, such as Zumba. These classes mix moves from many styles of dance into a fun, vigorous program for people of all ability and fitness levels.</text><text>Dance video games and DVDs are also a way to get dancing in the privacy of your own home. You can buy them or borrow them from your local library. Or, just turn up the music at home and dance in your living room.</text></h2><h2 title="How Dancing Compares to Other Exercise"><text>The workout you get from dance depends on the type of dancing you do and for how long you do it. For example, ballroom dancing will give you a moderate workout. This is about the same level of exercise you would get from walking briskly or doing water aerobics. Most types of ballroom dancing burn about 260 calories in an hour.</text><text>More intense types of dance, such as salsa or aerobic dancing, will give you a more vigorous workout that is similar to jogging or swimming laps. You can burn up to 500 calories an hour with these types of dance.</text></h2><h2 title="How to get Started"><text>Look for classes at dance schools, health clubs, or community centers. DO NOT worry if you do not have a partner. Many classes will find you a partner if you do not have one. Some types of dancing, such as tap and line dancing, do not require a partner.</text><text>If you are new to dance or you have been inactive, start with a beginner class. A beginner class will be easier to follow and will reduce your risk for injury. As you build your skill and fitness, you can try more advanced classes. You may even want to add new types of dance.</text><text>Not sure what type of dance to choose? Ask if you can watch a few classes first. Once you start a class, be patient. It can take some time to learn how to move your body and feet together with the music.</text></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>Exercise - dance; Wellness - dance</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 8/3/2018"><text>Updated by: Linda J.

Old nylons or tights make great substitutes for resistance bands.</detail><detail>Use chairs and stools. Chairs can work as props for doing certain exercises, such as leg lifts. A low, sturdy stool can be used for step training.</detail><detail>Hit the stairs. Who needs a stair machine when you have the old-fashioned kind in your house? You can create your own stair workout by walking up and down your stairs. Play some music to keep you going, and increase your workout by a song each time.</detail><detail>Get fitness DVDs or video games. Look for used copies or borrow them from your local library.</detail><detail>Look for used equipment. If you have a little money to spend, you can find deals on used fitness equipment at yard sales and thrift shops.</detail><detail>Invest in cheaper fitness items. Buying a few small fitness tools can help you vary your workout. A fitness ball can help strengthen your abs and improve your balance. Use a jump rope for a great cardio workout.</detail><detail>Use technology. Need a little help planning your workouts or staying motivated?

Older adults may find inexpensive classes at a local senior center.</detail><detail>Use local courts. Most communities have public basketball and tennis courts.</detail><detail>Go swimming. Find a local pool or lake and go for a swim.</detail><detail>Try other low-cost options. Try ice-skating, jogging, hiking, volleyball, or in-line skating.

<item><title>Exercise clothing and shoes</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000817.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>When exercising, what you wear can be just as important as what you do. Having the right footwear and clothing for your sport can give you both comfort and safety.</text><text>Thinking about where and how you exercise can help you choose the best clothing and shoes for your workouts. You can find many of the items you need at your local sporting goods, department, or discount stores.</text></h2><h2 title="Exercise Clothing Basics"><text>When choosing exercise clothing, consider both fabric and fit.</text><text>FABRICS</text><text>You can enjoy longer workouts and avoid overheating or getting too cold by choosing the right fabrics.</text><text>To help you stay comfortable and dry, choose fabrics that pull sweat away from your skin and dry quickly. Many quick-drying fabrics are synthetic, made of polyester or polypropylene. Look for terms like moisture-wicking, Dri-fit, Coolmax, or Supplex. Wool is also a good choice to keep you cool, dry, and naturally odor-free. Some workout clothing is made with special antimicrobial solutions to combat odor from sweat.</text><text>Socks also come in quick-drying fabrics that absorb sweat. They can help you stay cool and dry, and avoid blisters. Choose socks made with a polyester blend or other special fabric.</text><text>In general, it is best to avoid cotton. Cotton absorbs sweat and does not dry quickly. And because it stays wet, it can make you cold in cooler weather. In warm weather, it is not as good as synthetic fabrics at keeping you cool and dry if you sweat a lot.</text><text>FIT</text><text>In general, make sure your clothing does not get in the way of your activity. You want to be able to move easily. Clothing should not catch on equipment or slow you down.</text><text>You can wear loose-fitting clothing for activities like:</text><detail>Walking</detail><detail>Gentle yoga</detail><detail>Strength training</detail><detail>Basketball </detail><text>You may want to wear form-fitting, stretchy clothing for activities like:</text><detail>Running</detail><detail>Biking</detail><detail>Advanced yoga/Pilates</detail><detail>Swimming </detail><text>You may be able to wear a combination of loose and form-fitting clothing. For example, you might wear a moisture-wicking loose t-shirt or tank with form-fitting workout shorts. You can choose what is comfortable to you. Just make sure the material you choose helps pull sweat away from your skin.</text></h2><h2 title="Shoes to Match Your Activity"><text>The right shoes can make all the difference between feeling refreshed and having aching feet after your workout. It is worth the extra money you may need to spend for a good quality athletic shoe. </text><text>Make sure your shoes fit your activity.</text><detail>For running, buy running shoes. They are light, flexible, and supportive for simple forward strides. Make sure they have good arch support and cushioning for impact. For walking, choose stiffer shoes with good support and thick soles.</detail><detail>For strength or CrossFit training, choose training sneakers with good support and rubber soles that are not too bulky.</detail><detail>If you are playing a sport like basketball or soccer, get shoes that match your activity. </detail><text>Every foot is different. You may have wide or narrow feet, low arches, trouble areas, or flat feet. Even in adults, foot size can change, so get fitted every year. Also, you will need to replace shoes when they start to feel uncomfortable or the soles look worn. </text><text>Your shoe salesperson can help size and fit you for the right athletic shoes. Many stores will allow you to return shoes if you find they do not work for you.</text></h2><h2 title="When Exercising Outside"><text>If it is cold, dress in layers. Wear a fitted layer that wicks sweat away. Add a warmer layer, like a fleece jacket, on top. Wear gloves, a hat, and ear coverings if you need them. Take off the layers as you warm up. If you will be out running or walking, you may want to add a backpack. Then you can take off layers as you heat up, as well as carry a water bottle.</text><text>In the rain or wind, wear an outer layer that protects you, like a windbreaker or nylon shell. Look for the words "waterproof" or "water-resistant" on the label. Ideally, this layer should also be breathable.</text><text>In the hot sun, wear light-colored clothing that dries fast. You can also buy clothing made to block out the harmful rays of the sun. These clothes come with a sun protection factor (SPF) label.</text><text>When exercising in the evening or early morning, make sure your clothing has reflective parts so drivers can see you. You can also wear a reflective belt or vest.</text><text>Protect yourself from Lyme disease if you exercise in wooded areas. Wear long sleeves and pants and tuck your pants into your socks.

<item><title>Exercise and activity for weight loss</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000385.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>An active lifestyle and exercise routine, along with eating healthy foods, is the best way to lose weight.</text></h2><h2 title="The Weight-loss Formula"><text>Calories used in exercise &amp;gt; calories eaten = weight loss.</text><text>This means that to lose weight, the number of calories you burn by exercising needs to be greater than the number of calories from the foods you eat and drink. Even if you work out a lot, if you eat more calories than you burn, you will gain weight.</text><text>Another way to look at this is that a woman ages 30 to 50 years who does not exercise needs about 1,800 calories a day to maintain her normal weight. A man ages 30 to 50 years who does not exercise needs about 2,200 calories to maintain his normal weight.</text><text>For every hour of exercise they do, they would burn:</text><detail>240 to 300 calories doing light activity such as cleaning house or playing baseball or golf.</detail><detail>370 to 460 calories doing activity such as a brisk walk (3.5 mph), gardening, biking (5.5 mph), or dancing.</detail><detail>580 to 730 calories doing activity such as jogging at a pace of 9 minutes per mile, playing football, or swimming laps.</detail><detail>740 to 920 calories doing activity such as running at a pace of 7 minutes per mile, playing racquetball, and skiing. </detail><text>Even if you don't change the amount of calories in your diet, but you do add activity to your daily life, you'll lose weight or gain less weight.</text></h2><h2 title="Benefits of Weight Loss"><text>An exercise weight-loss program that works needs to be fun and keep you motivated. It helps to have a specific goal. Your goal might be managing a health condition, reducing stress, improving your stamina, or being able to buy clothes in a smaller size. Your exercise program may also be a way for you to be with other people. Exercise classes or exercising with a buddy are both good social outlets.</text><text>You may have a hard time starting an exercise routine, but once you do, you will begin to notice other benefits. Improved sleep and self-esteem might be a couple of them. Other benefits you may not notice include increased bone and muscle strength and a lower risk for heart disease and type 2 diabetes.</text></h2><h2 title="Getting Started"><text>You do not need to join a gym to get exercise. If you have not exercised or been active in a long time, be sure to start off slowly to prevent injuries. Taking a brisk 10-minute walk twice a week is a good start.</text><text>You can also try joining a dance, yoga, or karate class. You could also join a baseball or bowling team, or even a mall-walking group. The social aspects of these groups can be rewarding and motivating.</text><text>The most important thing is that you do exercises that you enjoy.</text></h2><h2 title="Build Physical Activity into Your Regular Routine"><text>Simple lifestyle changes can make a big difference over time.</text><detail>At work, try taking the stairs instead of the elevator, walking down the hall to talk with a co-worker instead of sending an e-mail, or adding a 10- to 20-minute walk during lunch.</detail><detail>When you are running errands, try parking at the far end of the parking lot or down the street. Even better, try walking to the store.</detail><detail>At home, try taking on common chores such as vacuuming, washing a car, gardening, raking leaves, or shoveling snow.</detail><detail>If you ride the bus, get off the bus one stop before your usual stop and walk the rest of the way. </detail></h2><h2 title="Reduce Your Screen Time"><text>Sedentary behaviors are things you do while you are sitting still. Decreasing your sedentary behaviors can help you lose weight. For most people, the best way to decrease sedentary behavior is to reduce the time they spend watching TV and using a computer and other electronic devices. All of these activities are called "screen time."</text><text>Some ways to decrease the harm of too much screen time are:</text><detail>Choose one or two TV programs to watch, and turn off the TV when they are over.</detail><detail>DO NOT keep the TV on all the time for background noise -- you might end up sitting down and watching it. Turn on the radio instead. You can be up doing things around the house and still listen to the radio.</detail><detail>DO NOT eat while you are watching TV.</detail><detail>Before you turn on the TV, take your dog for a walk. If you are going to miss your favorite show, record it.</detail><detail>Find activities to replace TV-watching. Read a book, play a board game with family or friends, or take an evening class.</detail><detail>Work out on an exercise mat while you watch TV. You will burn calories.</detail><detail>Ride a stationary bike or use a treadmill while you watch TV. </detail><text>If you like playing video games, try games that require you to move your whole body, not just your thumbs.</text></h2><h2 title="How Much Exercise Do You Need?"><text>Aim to exercise about 2.5 hours a week. Do moderate-intensity aerobic and muscle-strengthening activities. Depending on your schedule, you could exercise 30 minutes 5 days a week or 45 to 60 minutes 3 days a week.</text><text>You do not have to do your total daily exercise all at once. If your goal is to exercise for 30 minutes, you can break that up into shorter time periods that add up to 30 minutes.</text><text>As you become more fit, you can challenge yourself by increasing the intensity of your exercise by going from light activity to moderate activity. You can also increase the amount of time you exercise.</text></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>Weight loss - activity; Weight loss - exercise; Obesity - activity</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 8/22/2016"><text>Updated by: Laura J.

<item><title>Exercise and activity - children</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000353.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>Children should have many chances to play, run, bike, and play sports during the day. They should get 60 minutes of moderate activity every day.</text><text>Moderate activity makes your breathing and heartbeat speed up. Some examples are:</text><detail>Walking fast</detail><detail>Playing chase or tag</detail><detail>Playing basketball and most other organized sports (such as soccer, swimming, and dancing) </detail><text>Younger children cannot stick with the same activity as long as an older child.

Others would rather stay inside and play video games or watch TV. If your child does not like sports or physical activity, look for ways to motivate him. These ideas may help children become more active.</text><detail>Let children know that being active will give them more energy, make their bodies stronger, and make them feel better about themselves.</detail><detail>Give encouragement for physical activity and help children believe they can do it.</detail><detail>Be their role model. Start being more active if you are not already active yourself.</detail><detail>Make walking a part of your family's daily routine. Get good walking shoes and rain jackets for the wet days. DO NOT let rain stop you.</detail><detail>Go for walks together after dinner, before turning on the TV or playing computer games.</detail><detail>Take your family to community centers or parks where there are playgrounds, ball fields, basketball courts, and walking paths. It is easier to be active when people around you are active. </detail><detail>Encourage indoor activities such as dancing to your child's favorite music.</detail></h2><h2 title="Find a Good Match"><text>Organized sports and daily activities are good ways for your child to get exercise. You will have better success if you select activities that fit your child's preferences and abilities.</text><detail>Individual activities include swimming, running, skiing, or biking.</detail><detail>Group sports are another option, such as soccer, football, basketball, karate, or tennis.</detail><detail>Choose an exercise that works well for your child's age. A 6-year-old may play outside with other kids, while a 16-year-old may prefer to run at a track. </detail><text>Daily activities can use as much, or more, energy than some organized sports. Some everyday things your child can do to be active include:</text><detail>Walk or bike to school.</detail><detail>Take the stairs instead of the elevator.</detail><detail>Ride a bike with family or friends.</detail><detail>Take the dog for a walk.</detail><detail>Play outside. Shoot a basketball or kick and throw a ball around, for instance.</detail><detail>Play in the water, at a local pool, in a water sprinkler, or splashing in puddles.</detail><detail>Dance to music.</detail><detail>Skate, ice-skate, skate-board, or roller-skate.</detail><detail>Do household chores.

<item><title>Esophagectomy - discharge </title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000241.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>You had surgery to remove part, or all, of your esophagus (food tube). The remaining part of your esophagus and your stomach were rejoined.</text></h2><h2 title="When You're in the Hospital"><text>If you had surgery that used a laparoscope, several small cuts (incisions) were made in your upper belly, chest, or neck. If you had open surgery, larger cuts were made in your belly, chest, or neck.</text></h2><h2 title="What to Expect at Home"><text>You may be sent home with a drainage tube in your neck. This will be removed by your surgeon during an office visit.</text><text>You may have a feeding tube for 1 to 2 months after surgery. This will help you get enough calories to help you gain weight. You will also be on a special diet when you first get home.</text><text>Your stools may be looser and you may have bowel movements more often than before surgery.</text></h2><h2 title="Activity"><text>Ask your surgeon how much weight is safe for you to lift. You may be told not to lift or carry anything heavier than 10 pounds (4.5 kilograms).</text><text>You may walk 2 or 3 times a day, go up or down stairs, or ride in a car. Be sure to rest after being active. If it hurts when you do something, stop doing that activity. </text><text>Make sure your home is safe as you are recovering. For example, remove throw rugs to prevent tripping and falling. In the bathroom, install safety bars to help you get in and out of the tub or shower.</text><text>Your doctor will give you a prescription for pain medicines. Get it filled on your way home from the hospital so you have it when you need it. Take the medicine when you start having pain. Waiting too long will allow your pain to get worse than it should.</text></h2><h2 title="Wound Care"><text>Change your dressings (bandages) every day until your surgeon says you no longer need to keep your incisions bandaged. </text><text>Follow instructions for when you can start bathing. Your surgeon may say it is ok to remove the wound dressings and take a shower if sutures (stitches), staples, or glue were used to close your skin. DO NOT try to wash off the thin strips of tape or glue. They will come off on their own in about a week.</text><text>DO NOT soak in a bathtub, hot tub, or swimming pool until your surgeon tells you it is ok.</text><text>If you have large incisions, you may need to press a pillow over them when you cough or sneeze. This helps ease the pain. </text></h2><h2 title="Other Self-care"><text>You may be using a feeding tube after you go home. You will likely use it only at nighttime. The feeding tube will not interfere with your normal daytime activities. Follow your surgeon's instructions on diet and eating. </text><text>Follow instructions for doing deep-breathing exercises after you get home.</text><text>If you are a smoker and are having trouble quitting, talk with your doctor about medicines that you can help you quit smoking. Joining a stop-smoking program can help, too.</text><text>You may have some skin soreness around your feeding tube. Follow instructions on how to take care of the tube and the surrounding skin.</text></h2><h2 title="Follow-up"><text>After surgery, you will need close follow-up:</text><detail>You will see your surgeon 2 or 3 weeks after getting home. Your surgeon will check your wounds and see how you are doing with your diet.</detail><detail>You will have an x-ray to make sure the new connection between your esophagus and stomach is ok.</detail><detail>You will meet with a dietitian to go over your tube feedings and your diet.</detail><detail>You will see your oncologist, the doctor who treats your cancer. </detail></h2><h2 title="When to Call the Doctor"><text>Call your surgeon if you have any of the following:</text><detail>Fever of 101°F (38.3°C) or higher</detail><detail>Incisions are bleeding, red, warm to the touch, or have a thick, yellow, green, or milky drainage</detail><detail>Your pain medicines do not help ease your pain</detail><detail>It is hard to breathe</detail><detail>Cough that does not go away</detail><detail>Cannot drink or eat</detail><detail>Skin or the white part of your eyes turns yellow</detail><detail>Loose stools are loose or diarrhea</detail><detail>Vomiting after eating.</detail><detail>Severe pain or swelling in your legs</detail><detail>Burning sensation in your throat when you sleep or lay down </detail></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>Trans-hiatal esophagectomy - discharge; Trans-thoracic esophagectomy - discharge; Minimally invasive esophagectomy - discharge; En bloc esophagectomy - discharge; Removal of the esophagus - discharge</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 1/31/2017"><text>Updated by: Mary C.

<item><title>Erection problems - aftercare</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000396.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>You have seen your health care provider for erection problems. You may be unable to get an erection at all. Or you may prematurely lose the erection during intercourse. If the condition persists, the medical term for this problem is erectile dysfunction (ED).</text><text>Erection problems are common in adult men. In fact, almost all men have a problem getting or maintaining an erection at times.</text></h2><h2 title="Lifestyle"><text>For many men, lifestyle changes can help with ED. For example, alcohol and illegal drugs may make you feel more relaxed. But they can cause ED or make it worse. Avoid illegal drugs, and consider limiting the amount of alcohol you drink.</text><text>Smoking and smokeless tobacco can cause narrowing of blood vessels all over the body, including those that supply blood to the penis. Talk to your provider about quitting.</text><text>Other lifestyle tips include:</text><detail>Get plenty of rest and take time to relax.</detail><detail>Exercise and eat healthy foods to maintain good circulation.</detail><detail>Use safe sex practices. Reducing your worry about STDs may help prevent negative emotions that can affect your erection.</detail><detail>Talk with your provider and review your daily prescription medicine list. Many prescription medicines can cause or worsen ED. Some medicines you need to take for other medical conditions could add to ED, like medicines for high blood pressure or migraine medicines.</detail></h2><h2 title="Talking With Your Partner"><text>Having ED can make you feel bad about yourself. This can make it even more difficult to seek treatment and enjoy sexual activity.</text><text>ED can be a troubling issue for couples, because it can be difficult for you or your partner to discuss the problem with each other. Couples who do not openly talk to each other are more likely to have problems with sexual intimacy. Likewise, men who have trouble talking about their feelings may be unable to share their sexual concerns with their partners.</text><text>If you have trouble communicating, counseling can be very helpful for you and your partner. Finding a way for both of you to express your feelings and desires, and then work on the issues together, can make a big difference.</text></h2><h2 title="Medicines, Herbs, and Supplements"><text>Sildenafil (Viagra), vardenafil (Levitra, Staxyn), tadalafil (Cialis), and avanafil (Stendra) are oral medicines prescribed for ED. They cause erections only when you are sexually aroused.</text><detail>The effect is most often seen within 15 to 45 minutes. The effects of these drugs may last for several hours. Tadalafil (Cialis) may last for up to 36 hours.</detail><detail>Sildenafil (Viagra) should be taken on an empty stomach. (Levitra) and tadalafil (Cialis) may be taken with or without food.</detail><detail>These drugs should not be used more than once a day.</detail><detail>Common side effects of these medicines include flushing, upset stomach, headache, nasal congestion, back pain, and dizziness. </detail><text>Other ED medicines include drugs that are injected into the penis and tablets that can be inserted into the opening of the urethra. Your provider will teach you how to use these treatments if they are prescribed.</text><text>If you have heart disease, talk with your provider before using these medicines. Men who take nitrates for heart disease should not take ED medicines.</text><text>Many herbs and dietary supplements are marketed to help sexual performance or desire. None of these remedies have been proven effective for treating ED. Talk to your provider to see if any of these treatments is right for you. Treatment options other than medicines are available if medicines do not work for you. Talk to your provider about these treatments.</text></h2><h2 title="When to Call the Doctor"><text>Call your provider right away or go to an emergency room if any ED medicine gives you an erection that lasts more than 4 hours. If this problem is not treated, you may suffer lasting damage to your penis.</text><text>To end an erection you may try to repeat climax and apply a cold pack to your genitalia (wrap the pack in a cloth first). Never go to sleep with an erection.</text></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>Erectile dysfunction - self-care</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 8/26/2017"><text>Updated by: Jennifer Sobol, DO, urologist with the Michigan Institute of Urology, West Bloomfield, MI.

<item><title>Episiotomy - aftercare</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000483.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>An episiotomy is a minor incision made during childbirth to widen the opening of the vagina.</text><text>A perineal tear or laceration often forms on its own during a vaginal birth. Rarely, this tear will also involve the muscle around the anus or the rectum. (The last two problems are not discussed here.)</text><text>Both episiotomies and perineal lacerations require stitches to repair and ensure the best healing. Both are similar in recovery time and discomfort during healing.</text></h2><h2 title="What to Expect"><text>Most women heal without problems, although it may take many weeks. </text><text>Your stitches DO NOT need to be removed. Your body will absorb them. You can return to normal activities when you feel ready, such as light office work or house cleaning. Wait 6 weeks before you: </text><detail>Use tampons</detail><detail>Have sex</detail><detail>Do any other activity that might rupture (break) the stitches </detail></h2><h2 title="Self-care"><text>To relieve pain or discomfort: </text><detail>Ask your nurse to apply ice packs right after the birth. Using ice packs in the first 24 hours after birth decreases the swelling and helps with pain.</detail><detail>Take warm baths but wait until 24 hours after you have given birth. Make sure that the bathtub is cleaned with a disinfectant before every bath.</detail><detail>Take medicine like ibuprofen to relieve pain. </detail><text>You can do many other things to help speed up the healing process, such as: </text><detail>Use sitz baths (sit in water that covers your vulvar area) a few times a day. Wait until 24 hours after you have given birth to take a sitz bath as well. You can buy tubs in any drug store that will fit on the rim of the toilet. If you prefer, you can sit in this kind of tub instead of climbing into the bathtub.</detail><detail>Change your pads every 2 to 4 hours.</detail><detail>Keep the area around the stitches clean and dry. Pat the area dry with a clean towel after you bathe.</detail><detail>After you urinate or have a bowel movement, spray warm water over the area and pat dry with a clean towel or baby wipe. DO NOT use toilet paper. </detail><text>Take stool softeners and drink lots of water. This will prevent constipation. Eating lots of fiber will also help. Your health care provider can suggest foods with plenty of fiber. </text><text>Do Kegel exercises. Squeeze the muscles that you use to hold in urine for 5 minutes. Do this 10 times a day throughout the day. </text></h2><h2 title="When to Call the Doctor"><text>Call your provider if:</text><detail>Your pain gets worse.</detail><detail>You go for 4 or more days without a bowel movement.</detail><detail>You pass a blood clot larger than a walnut.</detail><detail>You have a discharge with a bad odor.</detail><detail>The wound seems to break open.</detail></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>Perineal laceration - aftercare; Vaginal birth perineal tear - aftercare; Postpartum care - episiotomy - aftercare; Labor - episiotomy aftercare; Vaginal delivery - episiotomy aftercare</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 4/19/2018"><text>Updated by: John D.

<item><title>Episiotomy</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000482.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>An episiotomy is a minor surgery that widens the opening of the vagina during childbirth. It is a cut to the perineum -- the skin and muscles between the vaginal opening and anus.</text></h2><h2 title="What are the Risks?"><text>There are some risks to having an episiotomy. Because of the risks, episiotomies are not as common as they used to be. The risks include: </text><detail>The cut may tear and become larger during the delivery. The tear may reach into the muscle around the rectum, or even into the rectum itself.</detail><detail>There may be more blood loss.</detail><detail>The cut and the stitches may get infected.</detail><detail>Sex may be painful for the first few months after birth. </detail><text>Sometimes, an episiotomy can be helpful even with the risks. </text></h2><h2 title="Will I Need an Episiotomy?"><text>Many women get through childbirth without tearing on their own, and without needing an episiotomy. In fact, recent studies show that not having an episiotomy is best for most women in labor.</text><text>Episiotomies don't heal better than tears. They often take longer to heal since the cut is often deeper than a natural tear. In both cases, the cut or tear must be stitched and properly cared for after childbirth. At times, an episiotomy may be needed to ensure the best outcome for you and your baby.</text><detail>Labor is stressful for the baby and the pushing phase needs to be shortened to decrease problems for the baby.</detail><detail>The baby's head or shoulders are too big for the mother's vaginal opening.</detail><detail>The baby is in a breech position (feet or buttocks coming first) and there is a problem during delivery.</detail><detail>Instruments (forceps or vacuum extractor) are needed to help get the baby out.</detail><text>You are pushing as the baby's head is close to coming out, and a tear forms toward the urethral area.</text></h2><h2 title="What Happens if I Need an Episiotomy?"><text>Just before your baby is born and as the head is about to crown, your doctor or midwife will give you a shot to numb the area (if you have not already had an epidural).</text><text>Next, a small incision (cut) is made. There are 2 types of cuts: median and mediolateral.</text><detail>A median incision is the most common type. It is a straight cut in the middle of the area between the vagina and anus (perineum).</detail><detail>The mediolateral incision is made at an angle. It is less likely to tear through to the anus, but it takes longer to heal than the median cut.</detail><text>Your health care provider will then deliver the baby through the enlarged opening.</text><text>Next, your provider will deliver the placenta (afterbirth). Then the cut will be stitched closed.</text></h2><h2 title="How can I Avoid an Episiotomy? "><text>You can do things to strengthen your body for labor that may lower your chances of needing an episiotomy.</text><detail>Practice Kegel exercises.</detail><detail>Perform perineal massage during the 4 to 6 weeks before birth.</detail><detail>Practice the techniques you learned in childbirth class to control your breathing and your urge to push. </detail><text>Keep in mind, even if you do these things, you may still need an episiotomy.

People with epilepsy have seizures. A seizure is a sudden brief change in the electrical and chemical activity in the brain. The doctor gave you a physical and a nervous system examination and did some tests to find out the cause of your seizures.</text></h2><h2 title="What to Expect at Home"><text>Your doctor sent you home with medicines to help keep you from having more seizures. This is because the doctor concluded you were at risk of having more seizures. After you get home, your doctor may still need to change the dosage of your seizure drugs or add new medicines. This may be because your seizures are not controlled, or you are having side effects.</text></h2><h2 title="Activity and Lifestyle"><text>You should get plenty of sleep and try to keep as regular a schedule as possible. Try to avoid too much stress.</text><text>Make sure your home is safe to help prevent injuries if a seizure takes place:</text><detail>Keep your bathroom and bedroom doors unlocked. Keep these doors from being blocked.</detail><detail>Take showers only. DO NOT take baths because of the risk of drowning during a seizure.</detail><detail>When cooking, turn pot and pan handles toward the back of the stove.</detail><detail>Fill your plate or bowl near the stove instead of taking all of the food to the table.</detail><detail>If possible, replace all glass doors either with safety glass or plastic.</detail><text>Most people with seizures can have a very active lifestyle. You should still plan ahead for the possible dangers of a certain activity. DO NOT do any activity during which loss of consciousness would be dangerous. Wait until it is clear that seizures are unlikely to occur. Safe activities include:</text><detail>Jogging</detail><detail>Aerobics</detail><detail>Cross-country skiing</detail><detail>Tennis</detail><detail>Golf</detail><detail>Hiking</detail><detail>Bowling</detail><text>There should always be a lifeguard or buddy present when you go swimming. Wear a helmet during bike riding, skiing, and similar activities. Ask your doctor if it is OK for you to play contact sports. Avoid activities during which having a seizure would put you or someone else in danger. </text><text>Wear a medical alert bracelet. Tell family, friends, and the people you work with about your seizure disorder.</text><text>Driving your own car is generally safe and legal once the seizures are controlled. State laws vary.

DO NOT stop taking your seizure medicines just because your seizures have stopped.</text><text>Tips for taking your seizure medicines:</text><detail>DO NOT skip a dose.</detail><detail>Get refills before you run out.</detail><detail>Keep seizure medicines in a safe place, away from children.</detail><detail>Store medicines in a dry place, in the bottle that they came in. Throw away all old bottles. </detail><text>If you miss a dose:</text><detail>Take it as soon as you remember.</detail><detail>Check with your doctor about what to do if you miss a dose for more than a few hours. There are many seizure medicines with different dosing schedules.</detail><detail>If you miss more than one dose, talk with your doctor or nurse. Mistakes are unavoidable and you may miss several doses at some point. So it may be useful to have this discussion ahead of time rather than when it happens. </detail><text>Drinking alcohol or doing illegal drugs can cause seizures.</text><detail>DO NOT drink alcohol if you take seizure medicines.</detail><detail>Using alcohol or illegal drugs will change the way your seizure medicines work in your body. This may increase the risk of seizures or side effects. </detail><text>Your health care provider will tell you when you need to check the blood level of your seizure drug. Seizure drugs have side effects. If you started taking a new drug recently, or your doctor changed the dosage of your seizure drug, these side effects may go away. Always ask your doctor about the side effects you may have and how to manage them.</text><text>Many seizure medicines can weaken the strength of your bones (osteoporosis). Ask your doctor about how to reduce the risk of osteoporosis through exercise and vitamin and mineral supplements.</text><text>For women during childbearing years:</text><detail>If you are planning on becoming pregnant, talk to your doctor about your seizure medicines beforehand.</detail><detail>If you get pregnant while taking seizure medicines, talk to your doctor right away. Ask your doctor if there are certain vitamins and supplements you should take in addition to your prenatal vitamin to prevent birth defects.</detail><detail>Never stop taking your seizure medicines without talking to your doctor first. </detail></h2><h2 title="How to Respond to a Seizure"><text>Once a seizure starts, there is no way to stop it.

<item><title>Epilepsy in children - discharge</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000127.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>Your child has epilepsy. People with epilepsy have seizures. A seizure is a sudden brief change in the electrical and chemical activity in the brain. The doctor gave your child a physical and nervous system examination and did some tests to find out the cause of your child's seizures.</text></h2><h2 title="What to Expect at Home"><text>If the doctor sent your child home with medicines, it is to help prevent more seizures occurring in your child. The medicine can help your child avoid having seizures, but it does not guarantee that seizures will not occur. The doctor may need to change the dosage of your child's seizure drugs or use different medicines if seizures persist despite your child taking the medicines, or because your child is having side effects. </text></h2><h2 title="Activity and Lifestyle"><text>Your child should get plenty of sleep and try to have as regular schedule as possible. Try to avoid too much stress. You should still set rules and limits, along with consequences, for a child with epilepsy.</text><text>Make sure your home is safe to help prevent injuries when a seizure takes place:</text><detail>Keep bathroom and bedroom doors unlocked. Keep these doors from being blocked.</detail><detail>Make sure your child stays safe in the bathroom. Younger children should not take a bath without someone present. DO NOT leave the bathroom without taking your child with you. Older children should only take showers.</detail><detail>Put pads on sharp corners of furniture.</detail><detail>Place a screen in front of the fireplace.</detail><detail>Use nonslip flooring or cushioned floor covers.</detail><detail>DO NOT use freestanding heaters.</detail><detail>Avoid letting a child with epilepsy sleep on the top bunk.</detail><detail>Replace all glass doors and any windows near the ground with either safety glass or plastic.</detail><detail>Plastic cups should be used instead of glassware.</detail><detail>The use of knives and scissors should be supervised.</detail><detail>Supervise your child in the kitchen. </detail><text>Most children with seizures can lead an active lifestyle. You should still plan ahead for the possible dangers of certain activities. These activities should be avoided if a loss of consciousness or control would result in an injury.</text><detail>Safe activities include jogging, aerobics, moderate cross-country skiing, dancing, tennis, golf, hiking, and bowling. Games and playing in gym class or on the playground are generally OK.</detail><detail>Supervise your child when swimming.</detail><detail>To prevent head injury, your child should wear a helmet during bike riding, skateboarding, and similar activities.</detail><detail>Children should have someone to help them climb on a jungle gym or perform gymnastics.</detail><detail>Ask your child's doctor about your child participating in contact sports. </detail><text>Have your child carry and take seizure medicines at school. Teachers and others at schools should know about your child's seizures and seizure medicines.</text><text>Your child should wear a medical alert bracelet. Tell family members, friends, teachers, school nurses, babysitters, swimming instructors, lifeguards, and coaches about your child's seizure disorder.</text></h2><h2 title="Seizure Medicines"><text>DO NOT stop giving your child seizure medicines without talking with your child's doctor. </text><text>DO NOT stop giving your child seizure medicines just because the seizures have stopped.</text><text>Tips for taking seizure medicines:</text><detail>DO NOT skip a dose.</detail><detail>Get refills before the medicine runs out.</detail><detail>Keep seizure medicines in a safe place, away from young children.</detail><detail>Store medicines in a dry place, in the bottle that they came in. Throw away all old bottles. </detail><text>If your child misses a dose:</text><detail>Have them take it as soon as you remember.</detail><detail>If it is already time for the next dose, skip the dose that you forgot to give your child and go back to the schedule. DO NOT give a double dose.</detail><detail>If your child misses more than one dose, talk with the child's health care provider. </detail><text>Drinking alcohol and taking illegal drugs can change the way seizure medicines work. Be aware of this possible problem in teenagers.</text><text>The provider may need to check your child's blood level of the seizure drug on a regular basis.</text><text>Seizure medicines have side effects. If your child started taking a new drug recently, or the doctor changed your child's dose, these side effects may go away. Always ask the child's doctor about any possible side effects. Also talk to your child's doctor about foods or other medicines that can change the blood level of an anti-seizure drug.</text></h2><h2 title="How to Respond to a Seizure"><text>Once a seizure starts, family members and caregivers can help make sure the child is safe from further injury and call for help, if needed. Your doctor may have prescribed a medicine that can be given during a prolonged seizure to make it stop sooner. Follow instructions on how to give the medicine to the child.</text><text>When a seizure occurs, the main goal is to protect the child from injury and make sure the child can breathe well. Try to prevent a fall. Help the child to the ground in a safe area. Clear the area of furniture or other sharp objects. Turn the child on their side to make sure the child's airway does not get obstructed during the seizure.</text><detail>Cushion the child's head.</detail><detail>Loosen tight clothing, especially around the child's neck.</detail><detail>Turn the child on their side. If vomiting occurs, turning the child on their side helps make sure that they do not inhale vomit into their lungs.</detail><detail>Stay with the child until they recover, or medical help arrives.

<item><title>Epidural block - pregnancy</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000484.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>An epidural block is a numbing medicine given by injection (shot) in the back. It numbs or causes a loss of feeling in the lower half your body. This lessens the pain of contractions during childbirth. An epidural block may also be used to reduce pain during surgery on the lower extremities. This article focuses on epidural blocks during childbirth.</text></h2><h2 title="How is the Epidural Given? "><text>The block or shot is given into an area over your lower back or spine.</text><detail>You may be asked to lie on your side, or you may sit up.</detail><detail>Either way, you will be asked to pull your stomach inward and hunch your back outward. </detail><text>Your health care provider will wash the area of your back and inject a little medicine to numb the spot where the epidural needle is placed:</text><detail>The provider inserts a needle into your lower back.</detail><detail>The needle is placed into a small space outside your spinal cord.</detail><detail>A small soft tube (catheter) is placed into your back, next to your spine.</detail><detail>The needle is removed. </detail><text>The numbing medicine is given through the tube for as long as it is needed.</text><text>In most cases, you will receive a low dose because it is safer for you and baby. Once the medicine takes effect (10 to 20 minutes), you should feel better. You may still feel some back or rectal pressure during contractions.</text><text>You may shiver after an epidural, but this is common. Many women shiver during labor even without an epidural.</text><picname>Epidural - Series</picname><picurl>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/images/ency/fullsize/19168.jpg</picurl></h2><h2 title="Is an Epidural Safe?"><text>Many studies have shown that an epidural is a safe way to manage pain during childbirth. While rare, there are some risks.</text><text>Your blood pressure may drop for a short while. This might cause the baby's heart rate to slow down.</text><detail>To avoid this, you will receive fluids through an intravenous (IV) line to help keep your blood pressure stable.</detail><detail>If your blood pressure shows a drop, you may need to lie on your side to keep the blood moving throughout your body.</detail><detail>Your provider may also give you medicine to raise your blood pressure.</detail><text>An epidural block may change or alter labor and delivery.</text><detail>If you are very numb from the block, you may have a harder time bearing down to push your baby through the birth canal.</detail><detail>Contractions may lessen or slow down for a little while, but labor will still move along as it should. In some cases, it may even go faster. If your labor slows down, your doctor can give you medicine to speed up your contractions. It is best to wait until you are in active labor to have the epidural placed.</detail><text>Other rare side effects are:</text><detail>You may get a headache after your epidural but this is rare.</detail><detail>Medicine could enter your spinal fluid. For a short while, it could make you feel dizzy, or you might have a hard time breathing. You could also have a seizure. This is also rare.</detail></h2><h2 title="What Types of Epidurals are There?"><text>There are 2 types:</text><detail>"Walking" epidural block. This type of epidural will lessen your pain, but you will still be able to move your legs. Most women are not really able to walk around, but they can move their legs.</detail><detail>Combined spinal epidural block. This combines both a spinal and epidural block. It provides pain relief much faster. The combined block is used when women are in very active labor and want relief right away. </detail></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>Delivery - epidural; Labor - epidural</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 4/19/2018"><text>Updated by: John D.

<item><title>Enterovirus D68</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000782.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>Enterovirus D68 (EV-D68) is a virus that causes flu-like symptoms that range from mild to severe. </text><text>EV-D68 was first discovered in 1962. Until 2014, this virus was not common in the United States. In 2014, an outbreak occurred across the country in nearly every state. Many more cases have occurred than in years past. Nearly all have been in children. </text><text>To learn more about the 2014 outbreak, visit the CDC web page -- www.cdc.gov/non-polio-enterovirus/about/EV-D68.html.</text></h2><h2 title="Who Gets the Virus?"><text>Infants and children are most at risk for EV-D68. This is because most adults are already immune to the virus because of past exposure. Adults may have mild symptoms or none at all. Children are more likely to have severe symptoms. Children with asthma are at higher risk for severe illness. They often have to go to the hospital.</text></h2><h2 title="Symptoms"><text>Symptoms can be mild or severe.</text><text>Mild symptoms include:</text><detail>Fever</detail><detail>Runny nose</detail><detail>Sneezing</detail><detail>Cough</detail><detail>Body and muscle aches</detail><text>Severe symptoms include:</text><detail>Wheezing</detail><detail>Difficulty Breathing</detail></h2><h2 title="How the Virus Spreads"><text>EV-D68 is spread through fluids in the respiratory track such as:</text><detail>Saliva</detail><detail>Nasal fluids</detail><detail>Phlegm </detail><text>The virus can be spread when:</text><detail>Someone sneezes or coughs.</detail><detail>Someone touches something a sick person has touched and then touches his own eyes, nose, or mouth.</detail><detail>Someone has close contact such as kissing, hugging, or shaking hands with someone who has the virus. </detail></h2><h2 title="Diagnosis"><text>EV-D68 can be diagnosed by testing fluid samples taken from the throat or nose. Samples must be sent to a special lab for testing. Tests often aren't done unless someone has severe illness with unknown cause.</text></h2><h2 title="Treatment"><text>There is no specific treatment for EV-D68. In most cases, the illness will go away on its own. You can treat symptoms with over-the-counter medicines for pain and fever. DO NOT give aspirin to children under the age of 18.</text><text>People with severe breathing problems may need to go to the hospital. They will receive treatment to help relieve symptoms.</text></h2><h2 title="How to Prevent the Virus from Spreading"><text>There is no vaccine to prevent EV-D68 infection. But you can take steps to prevent spreading the virus.</text><detail>Wash your hands often with soap. Teach your children to do the same.</detail><detail>Do not put unwashed hands around your eyes, mouth, or nose.</detail><detail>Do not share cups or eating utensils with someone who is sick.</detail><detail>Avoid close contact such as shaking hands, kissing, and hugging people who are sick.</detail><detail>Cover coughs and sneezes with your sleeve or a tissue.</detail><detail>Clean touched surfaces such as toys or doorknobs often.</detail><detail>Stay home when you are sick, and keep your children home if they are sick. </detail></h2><h2 title="Protecting Children with Asthma"><text>Children with asthma are at increased risk for severe illness from EV-D68. The CDC makes the following recommendations to help keep your child safe:</text><detail>Be sure your child's asthma action plan is up to date and that you and your child both understand it.</detail><detail>Make sure your child continues to take asthma medicines.</detail><detail>Always be sure your child has reliever medicines.</detail><detail>Make sure your child gets a flu shot.</detail><detail>If asthma symptoms worsen, follow the steps in the asthma action plan.</detail><detail>Call your health care provider right away if the symptoms do not go away.</detail><detail>Be sure your child's teachers and caretakers know about your child's asthma and what to do to help. </detail></h2><h2 title="When to Call the Doctor"><text>If you or your child with a cold has a hard time breathing, contact your provider right away or get emergency care.</text><text>Also, contact your provider if your symptoms or your child's symptoms are getting worse.</text></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>Non-polio enterovirus</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 9/27/2017"><text>Updated by: Jatin M.

<item><title>Enlarged prostate - after care</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000398.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>The prostate is a gland that produces the fluid that carries sperm during ejaculation. It surrounds the tube through which urine passes out of the body (the urethra).</text><text>An enlarged prostate means the gland has grown bigger. As the gland grows, it can block the urethra and cause problems, such as:</text><detail>Not being able to fully empty your bladder</detail><detail>Needing to urinate two or more times per night</detail><detail>Slowed or delayed start of the urinary stream and dribbling at the end</detail><detail>Straining to urinate and weak urine stream</detail><detail>Strong and sudden urge to urinate or a loss of urinary control</detail></h2><h2 title="Lifestyle Changes "><text>The following changes may help you control symptoms:</text><detail>Urinate when you first get the urge. Also, go to the bathroom on a timed schedule, even if you do not feel a need to urinate.</detail><detail>Avoid alcohol and caffeine, especially after dinner.</detail><detail>DO NOT drink a lot of fluid all at once. Spread out fluids over the day. Avoid drinking fluids within 2 hours of bedtime.</detail><detail>Keep warm and exercise regularly. Cold weather and lack of physical activity may worsen symptoms.</detail><detail>Reduce stress. Nervousness and tension can lead to more frequent urination. </detail><text>Learn about exercises (Kegel exercises) that strengthen the pelvic floor muscles. Doing these exercise may help with leaking or losing control of your urine. Once you have learned how to do these, you should perform them 3 times a day.</text></h2><h2 title="Medicines, Herbs, and Supplements"><text>Your health care provider may have you take a medicine called alpha-1- blocker. Most people find that these drugs help their symptoms. Symptoms often get better soon after starting on the medicine. You must take this medicine every day. There are several medicines in this category, including terazosin (Hytrin), doxazosin (Cardura), tamsulosin (Flomax), alfusozin (Uroxatrol), and silodosin (Rapaflow).</text><detail>Common side effects include nasal stuffiness, headaches, lightheadedness when you stand up, and weakness. You may also notice less semen when you ejaculate. This is not a medical problem but some men don't like how it feels.</detail><detail>Ask your provider before taking Sildenafil (Viagra), vardenafil (Levitra), and tadalafil (Cialis) with alpha-1- blockers because there can sometimes be an interaction. </detail><text>Other drugs such as finasteride or dutasteride may also be prescribed. These medicines help shrink the prostate over time and help with symptoms.</text><detail>You will need to take these drugs every day for 3 to 6 months before your symptoms begin to improve.</detail><detail>Side effects include less interest in sex and less semen when you ejaculate. </detail><text>Watch out for drugs that may make your symptoms worse:</text><detail>Try NOT to take over-the-counter cold and sinus medicines that contain decongestants or antihistamines. They can make your symptoms worse.</detail><detail>Men who are taking water pills or diuretics may want to talk to their provider about reducing the dosage or switching to another type of drug.</detail><detail>Other drugs that may worsen symptoms are certain antidepressants and drugs used to treat spasticity. </detail><text>Many herbs and supplements have been tried for treating an enlarged prostate.</text><detail>Saw palmetto has been used by millions of men to ease BPH symptoms. It is unclear whether this herb is effective in relieving the signs and symptoms of BPH.</detail><detail>Talk with your provider about any herbs or supplements you are taking.</detail><detail>Often, makers or herbal remedies and dietary supplements do not need approval from the FDA to sell their products. </detail></h2><h2 title="When to Call the Doctor"><text>Call your provider right away if you have:</text><detail>Less urine than usual</detail><detail>Fever or chills</detail><detail>Back, side, or abdominal pain</detail><detail>Blood or pus in your urine </detail><text>Also call if:</text><detail>Your bladder does not feel completely empty after you urinate.</detail><detail>You take medicines that may cause urinary problems. These may include diuretics, antihistamines, antidepressants, or sedatives. DO NOT stop or change your medicines without first talking to your doctor.</detail><detail>You have taken tried self-care steps and your symptoms have not gotten better. </detail></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>BPH - self-care; Benign prostatic hypertrophy - self-care; Benign prostatic hyperplasia - self-care</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 8/26/2017"><text>Updated by: Jennifer Sobol, DO, urologist with the Michigan Institute of Urology, West Bloomfield, MI.

<item><title>Ending pregnancy with medicines</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000835.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>More About Medical Abortion</text><text>Some women prefer medical abortions because:</text><detail>You can use it with an early pregnancy.</detail><detail>You can do it at home.</detail><detail>It feels more natural, like a miscarriage.</detail><detail>It is less invasive than an in-clinic abortion. </detail><text>Medicines can be used to end an early pregnancy. In many cases, the first day of your last period has to be less than 9 weeks ago. If you are over 9 weeks pregnant, you can have an in-clinic abortion. Some clinics will go beyond 9 weeks for a medicine abortion.</text><text>Be very certain that you want to end your pregnancy. It is not safe to stop the medicines once you have started taking them. Doing so creates a very high risk for severe birth defects.</text><text>Who Should Not Have a Medical Abortion</text><text>You should NOT have a medicine abortion if you:</text><detail>Are over 9 weeks pregnant (time since the start of your last period).</detail><detail>Have a blood clotting disorder or adrenal failure.</detail><detail>Have an IUD. It must be removed first.</detail><detail>Are allergic to the medicines that are used to end pregnancy.</detail><detail>Take any medicines that should not be used with a medical abortion.</detail><detail>Do not have access to a doctor or an emergency room. </detail><text>Getting Ready for a Medical Abortion</text><text>The health care provider will:</text><detail>Do a physical exam and ultrasound</detail><detail>Go over your medical history</detail><detail>Do blood and urine tests</detail><detail>Explain how the abortion medicines work</detail><detail>Have you sign forms </detail><text>What Happens During a Medical Abortion</text><text>You will take 2 medicines for the abortion:</text><detail>Mifepristone - this is called the abortion pill or RU-486</detail><detail>Misoprostol</detail><detail>You will also take antibiotics to prevent infection </detail><text>You will take mifepristone in the provider's office or clinic. This stops the hormone progesterone from working. The lining of the uterus breaks down so the pregnancy cannot continue.</text><text>The provider will tell you when and how to take the misoprostol. It will be about 6 to 72 hours after taking mifepristone. Misoprostol causes the uterus to contract and empty.</text><text>After taking the second medicine, you will feel a lot of pain and cramping. You will have heavy bleeding and see blood clots and tissue come out of your vagina. This most often takes 3 to 5 hours. The amount will be more than you have with your period. This means the medicines are working.</text><text>You may also have nausea, and you may vomit, have a fever, chills, diarrhea, and a headache.</text><text>You can take pain relievers such as ibuprofen (Motrin, Advil) or acetaminophen (Tylenol) to help with the pain. Do not take aspirin. Expect to have light bleeding for up to 4 weeks after a medical abortion. You will need to have pads to wear. Plan to take it easy for a few weeks.</text><text>You should avoid vaginal intercourse for about a week after a medical abortion. You can get pregnant soon after an abortion, so talk with your health care provider about what birth control to use. Make sure you are using an effective contraception before you resume sexual activity. You should get your regular period in about 4 to 8 weeks.</text><text>Follow up with Your Health Care Provider</text><text>Make a follow-up appointment with your provider. You need to be checked to make sure the abortion was complete and that you are not having any problems. In case it did not work, you will need to have an in-clinic abortion.</text><text>Risks to Ending Pregnancy with Medicine</text><text>Most women have a medical abortion safely. There are a few risks, but most can be treated easily:</text><detail>An incomplete abortion is when part of the pregnancy does not come out. You will need to have an in-clinic abortion to complete the abortion.</detail><detail>Heavy bleeding</detail><detail>Infection</detail><detail>Blood clots in your uterus </detail><text>Medical abortions are typically very safe. In most cases, it does not affect your ability to have children unless you have a serious complication.</text><text>When to Call the Doctor</text><text>Serious problems must be treated right away for your safety. Call your provider if you have:</text><detail>Heavy bleeding - you are soaking through 2 pads every hour for 2 hours</detail><detail>Blood clots for 2 hours or more, or if the clots are larger than a lemon</detail><detail>Signs that you are still pregnant </detail><text>You should also call your doctor if you have signs of infection:</text><detail>Bad pain in your stomach or back</detail><detail>A fever over 100.4°F (38°C) or any fever for 24 hours</detail><detail>Vomiting or diarrhea for more than 24 hours after taking the pills</detail><detail>Bad smelling vaginal discharge </detail></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>Abortion pill</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 7/17/2017"><text>Updated by: Cynthia D.

<item><title>Elbow sprain - aftercare</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000679.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>A sprain is an injury to the ligaments around a joint. A ligament is a band of tissue that connects bone to bone. The ligaments in your elbow help connect the bones of your upper and lower arm around your elbow joint. When you sprain your elbow, you have pulled or torn one or more of the ligaments in your elbow joint.</text></h2><h2 title="More About Your Injury"><text>An elbow sprain can occur when your arm is quickly bent or twisted in an unnatural position. It can also happen when the ligaments are overloaded during regular movement. Elbow sprains can happen when:</text><detail>You fall with your arm stretched out, such as when playing sports</detail><detail>Your elbow is hit very hard, such as during a car accident </detail></h2><h2 title="What to Expect"><text>You may notice:</text><detail>Elbow pain and swelling</detail><detail>Bruising, redness, or warmth around your elbow</detail><detail>Pain when you move your elbow </detail><text>Tell your doctor if you heard a "pop" when you injured your elbow. This could be a sign that the ligament was torn.</text><text>After examining your elbow, your doctor may order an x-ray to see if there are any breaks (fractures) to the bones in your elbow. You may also have an MRI of the elbow. The MRI pictures will show whether tissues around your elbow have been stretched or torn. </text><text>If you have an elbow sprain, you may need:</text><detail>A sling to keep your arm and elbow from moving</detail><detail>A cast or splint if you have severe sprain </detail></h2><h2 title="Self-care at Home"><text>Your health care provider will likely instruct you to follow RICE to help reduce pain and swelling:</text><detail>Rest your elbow. Avoid lifting anything with your arm and elbow. Don't move the elbow unless you're instructed to do so.</detail><detail>Ice your elbow for 15 to 20 minutes at a time, 3 to 4 times a day. Wrap the ice in cloth. DO NOT place ice directly on the skin. Cold from the ice can damage your skin.</detail><detail>Compress the area by wrapping it with an elastic bandage or compression wrap.</detail><detail>Elevate your elbow by raising it above the level of your heart. You can prop it up with pillows. </detail><text>You can take ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), or naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn) to reduce pain and swelling. Acetaminophen (Tylenol) helps with pain, but not swelling. You can buy these pain medicines at the store.</text><detail>Talk with your provider before using these medicines if you have heart disease, high blood pressure, kidney or liver disease, or have had stomach ulcers or internal bleeding in the past.</detail><detail>DO NOT take more than the amount recommended on the bottle or by your provider. </detail></h2><h2 title="Activity"><text>You may need to wear a sling, splint, or cast for about 2 to 3 weeks while your elbow heals. Depending on how badly it is sprained, you may need to work with a physical therapist who will show you stretching and strengthening exercises.</text><text>Most people recover completely from a simple elbow sprain in about 4 weeks.</text></h2><h2 title="When to Call the Doctor"><text>Call your doctor if:</text><detail>You have increased swelling or pain</detail><detail>Self-care does not seem to help </detail></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>Elbow injury - aftercare; Sprained elbow - aftercare</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 9/7/2017"><text>Updated by: C.

<item><title>Elbow replacement - discharge </title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000195.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>You had surgery to replace your elbow joint with artificial joint parts (prosthetics).</text><text>The surgeon made a cut (incision) in the back of your upper or lower arm and removed damaged tissue and parts of the bones. The surgeon then put the artificial joint in place and closed the skin with sutures (stitches).</text><text>Now that you're going home, be sure to follow your surgeon's instructions on how to take care of your new elbow.</text></h2><h2 title="When You're in the Hospital"><text>While in the hospital, you should have received pain medicine. You also learned how to manage swelling around your new joint.</text><text>Your doctor or physical therapist may have taught you exercises to do at home.</text></h2><h2 title="What to Expect at Home"><text>Your elbow area may feel warm and tender for 2 to 4 weeks after surgery. The swelling should go down during this time.</text><text>For the first week after surgery, you may have a soft splint on your arm to hold your elbow in place. Some people need to use a harder splint or brace that has a hinge when the incision has healed</text><text>You will need help with chores such as shopping, bathing, making meals, and housework for up to 6 weeks. You may want to make some changes around your home so it is easier for you to take care of yourself.</text><text>You will need to wait 4 to 6 weeks before you can drive. Your surgeon or physical therapist will tell you when it is ok.</text><text>You may be able to start using your elbow as soon as 12 weeks after surgery. Full recovery can take up to a year.</text></h2><h2 title="Activity "><text>How much you can use your arm and when you can start using it will depend on the condition of your elbow. Be sure to ask the surgeon what limits you may have.</text><text>The surgeon will have you go to physical therapy to help you gain strength and use of your arm: </text><detail>If you have a splint, you may need to wait a few weeks to start therapy.</detail><detail>Before starting physical therapy, ask your surgeon if you should begin to increase movement in your elbow by gently bending it back and forth. If you have pain or problems with your incision when you do this, you may be bending the elbow too much and need to stop.</detail><detail>Reduce soreness after physical therapy by putting ice on the joint for 15 minutes. Wrap the ice in cloth. DO NOT put ice directly on the skin because this can cause frostbite. </detail><text>After the first week, you may be able to use your splint only while sleeping. Ask your surgeon if this is ok.

Ask your surgeon or physical therapist what other activities you can do at this point.</text><text>Make sure you know the proper way to use your elbow before you start any activity or move your arm for any reason. Ask your surgeon or physical therapist if you can:</text><detail>Lift things heavier than 5 to 15 pounds (2.5 to 6.8 kg) for the rest of your life.</detail><detail>Play golf or tennis, or throw objects (such as a ball) for the rest of your life.</detail><detail>Do any activities that make you lift your elbow over and over, such as shoveling or shooting basketballs.</detail><detail>Do jamming or pounding activities, such as hammering.</detail><detail>Do impact sports, such as boxing or football.</detail><detail>Do physical activities that need quick stop and start motions or twisting with your elbow.</detail><detail>Push or pull heavy objects. </detail></h2><h2 title="Wound Care"><text>The stitches on your wound will be removed about 1 week after surgery. Keep the dressing (bandage) over your wound clean and dry. You may change the dressing every day if you like.</text><detail>DO NOT shower until after your follow-up appointment with your doctor. Your doctor will tell you when you can begin taking showers. When you do start showering again, let the water run over the incision, but do not let the water beat down on it. DO NOT scrub.</detail><detail>DO NOT soak the wound in a bathtub, hot tub, or swimming pool for at least the first 3 weeks.</detail></h2><h2 title="Pain"><text>Pain is normal after elbow replacement surgery. It should get better over time.</text><text>Your doctor will give you a prescription for pain medicine. Get it filled when you go home so that you have it when you need it. Take the pain medicine when you start having pain. Waiting too long to take it allows the pain to get worse than it should.</text><text>Ibuprofen or another anti-inflammatory medicine may also help. Ask your doctor what other medicines are safe to take with your pain medicine. Follow instructions exactly on how to take your medicines.</text><text>Narcotic pain medicine (codeine, hydrocodone, and oxycodone) can make you constipated.

<item><title>Eight ways to cut your health care costs</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000870.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>The cost of health care continues to rise. That is why it helps to learn how to take steps to limit your out-of-pocket health care costs.</text><text>Learn how to save money and still receive the care you need. Start by looking at your plan information so you know what services are available. Try the tips below to help you get the most from your benefits and save money on your care.</text><text>1. Save Money on Medicines</text><text>There are a few ways to cut costs on your medicines.</text><detail>Ask your health care provider if you can switch to generic medicines. They have the same active ingredient, but cost less than brand name drugs.</detail><detail>Ask your provider if there is a less expensive medicine that treats the same condition.</detail><detail>See if you can order your medicine through the mail.</detail><detail>Take all of your medicines as directed. Not taking your medicine or not taking enough medicine may lead to further health problems.</detail><text>2. Use Your Benefits</text><detail>Get routine health screenings. These tests can catch health problems early, when they may be more easily treated. And you often do not have to pay a copay for health screenings, vaccines, and annual well visits.</detail><detail>Get prenatal care if you are pregnant. This is the best way to ensure you and your baby will be healthy.</detail><detail>Some health plans offer health advocates or case managers. A health advocate can help you get the most of your benefits. A case manager can help you to manage complex health problems such as diabetes or asthma.</detail><detail>Use free and discounted services. Many health plans offer discounts on things like gym memberships or eyewear.</detail><text>3. Plan Ahead for Urgent and Emergency Care</text><text>When an illness or injury occurs, you need to decide how serious it is and how soon to get medical care. This will help you choose whether to call your provider, go to an urgent care clinic, or get emergency care.</text><text>You can decide where to get care by thinking about how quickly you need care.</text><detail>If a person or unborn baby could die or have permanent harm, it is an emergency. Examples include chest pain, trouble breathing, or severe pain or bleeding.</detail><detail>If you need care that cannot wait until the next day to see your provider, you need urgent care. Examples of urgent care include strep throat, bladder infection, or a dog bite.</detail><text>You will save both time and money if you use an urgent care center or see your provider rather than going to the emergency department. Plan ahead by knowing which urgent care center is near you. Also, learn how to recognize an emergency in adults and in a child.</text><text>4. Ask About Outpatient Facilities</text><text>If you need a procedure or surgery, ask your provider if you can have it done at an outpatient clinic. Often, getting care at a clinic is cheaper than having the same procedure in a hospital.</text><text>5. Choose In-Network Health Care Providers</text><text>Depending on your health coverage, you may have the choice to see providers who are in-network or out-of-network. You pay less to see providers who are in-network, because they have a contract with your health plan. This means they charge lower rates.</text><text>6. Take Care of Your Health</text><text>A simple way to save money on health care is to stay healthy. Of course, that is sometimes easier said than done. But staying at a healthy weight, getting regular exercise, and not smoking lowers your risk for health problems. Staying healthy helps you avoid costly tests and treatments for ongoing conditions such as diabetes or heart disease.</text><text>7. Choose a Health Plan That is Right for You.</text><text>When choosing a plan, think about the health needs of you and your family. If you pick a plan with higher premiums, more of your health costs will be covered. This may be a good idea if you have a health problem, such as diabetes, and need regular care. If you rarely need medical care, then you may want to choose a plan with a higher deductible. You will pay lower monthly premiums and likely save money overall. Also compare prescription drug coverage.</text><text>8. Use a Health Care Savings Account (HSA) or Flexible Spending Account (FSA)</text><text>Many employers offer an HSA or FSA. These are savings accounts that allow you to set aside pre-tax money for health care expenses. This can help you save several hundred dollars per year. HSAs are owned by you, earn interest, and can be transferred to a new employer. FSAs are owned by your employer, do not earn interest, and must be used within the calendar year.</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 8/3/2018"><text>Updated by: Linda J.

It also prevents anemia in the mother.</detail><detail>Folic acid, for reducing the risk for spina bifida (incomplete closing of the spinal column), anencephaly (defect of the brain), and other birth defects. </detail></h2><h2 title="What to Eat"><text>Eating a well-rounded diet with all of the right nutrients and getting at least 30 minutes of exercise per day is important for a healthy pregnancy. For most normal-weight pregnant women, the right amount of calories is:</text><detail>About 1,800 calories per day during the first trimester</detail><detail>About 2,200 calories per day during the second trimester</detail><detail>About 2,400 calories per day during the third trimester</detail><text>Bread, cereal, rice, and pasta:</text><detail>Eat 9 to 11 servings a day.</detail><detail>These foods give you carbohydrates. They turn into energy for your body and for your baby's growth.</detail><detail>Whole-grain and fortified products have folic acid and iron.</detail><text>Vegetables:</text><detail>Vegetables are a good source of vitamins A and C, folic acid, iron, and magnesium.</detail><detail>Eat 4 to 5 servings a day.</detail><detail>Try to get at least 2 of your daily servings from green, leafy vegetables.</detail><text>Fruit:</text><detail>Eat 3 to 4 servings a day.</detail><detail>Fruit gives you vitamins A and C, potassium, and fiber. Choose fresh fruits and juices. They are better for you than frozen or canned fruits. Eat plenty of vitamin C-rich foods, like citrus fruits, melons, and berries. Try to avoid juices that have sugar or sweeteners added. </detail><text>Milk, yogurt, and cheese:</text><detail>Eat 3 servings a day.</detail><detail>Dairy products are a great source of protein, calcium, and phosphorus. If you need to limit calories and cholesterol, choose nonfat dairy products. </detail><text>Meat, poultry, fish, dry beans, eggs, and nuts:</text><detail>Eat 3 servings a day.</detail><detail>Foods from this group are good sources of B vitamins, protein, iron, and zinc. </detail><text>Fats and oils</text><text>You need moderate amounts of fat in your diet for you and your growing baby. Fats provide long-term energy for growth and are needed for brain development. Women with special diet needs should plan their meals carefully to make sure they get the nutrition they need. Talk to your provider or a dietitian if you have a special diet, such as:</text><detail>Vegetarian or vegan</detail><detail>Lactose intolerant</detail><detail>Gluten-free </detail></h2><h2 title="Fluids and Vitamins"><text>Pregnant women should also drink plenty of fluids. Avoid drinks with caffeine and sugar. Ask your provider how much fluid you should get each day.</text><text>You should also take a prenatal vitamin that has folic acid, iron, and the other vitamins and minerals that all women need. Your provider may give you a prescription for vitamins. You can also get prenatal vitamins over the counter.</text></h2><h2 title="Food Cravings"><text>Though no one knows why, many pregnant women have cravings for certain foods. It may be because of hormone changes. These cravings will often pass after the first 3 months.</text><text>As long as you are getting all the nutrients you need for you and your baby, it is fine to have some of the foods you crave every now and then.</text><text>Sometimes, pregnant women will get strange cravings for things that are not food, such as dirt, clay, laundry detergent, or ice chips. This is called pica, and it may be caused by too little iron in the blood, which leads to anemia. Let your provider know if you have these cravings.</text></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>Prenatal care - eating right</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 10/4/2016"><text>Updated by: John D.

<item><title>Eating out</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000339.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>Eating out is a part of our busy modern lives. Even though you need to be careful to not eat too much, it is possible to go out and enjoy yourself while staying healthy.</text><text>If you know how to pick the right foods, and the right amount of foods, you can go to almost any type of restaurant. </text><text>Be aware that the portion sizes at many restaurants are very large. Stay away from all-you-can-eat buffets. The temptation for overeating can be hard to resist at these places. Think and plan ahead:</text><detail>If you know you are going out, check out the menu online so you can make healthy choices ahead of time.</detail><detail>Avoid eating out when you are very hungry. Eat a small healthy snack, such as carrots or a small apple, shortly before going out. </detail><text>When ordering, do not be afraid to ask to have something cooked in a healthier manner such as baked or steamed instead of fried. Ask to have sauces served on the side.</text></h2><h2 title="Basic Ground Rules for Eating Out"><text>Look for and choose:</text><detail>Salads and other vegetable side dishes</detail><detail>Foods that are broiled, grilled, steamed, poached, roasted, or baked</detail><detail>Chicken, turkey, seafood, or lean meats </detail><text>Treat yourself only once in a while to:</text><detail>Anything creamy, fried, crispy, breaded, battered, or au gratin</detail><detail>Sauces or soups with lots of butter, cream, or cheese</detail><detail>Thick or creamy salad dressings</detail><detail>Most casserole dishes </detail><text>A few easy tips to keep the calorie count down include:</text><detail>If you were serving yourself a healthy meal at home half of your plate would be covered in green vegetables; if your entrée does not come with a vegetable order one on the side so you can still make a healthy plate.</detail><detail>Choose carefully. Avoid eating foods such as rolls and bread just because they are on the table.</detail><detail>Split a meal with someone, or ask for a take-out box and take half of your meal home.</detail><detail>Order the "lunch size" of any food rather than the "dinner size."</detail><detail>Order appetizers rather than an entrée.</detail><detail>Start with a small salad or broth-based soup as an appetizer.</detail><detail>Order the dressing for your salad on the side so you can control how much of it you use.</detail><detail>Drink water or low-fat milk. Limit fluids that have empty calories, such as sodas.</detail><detail>Limit how much alcohol you have with meals. Wine is better than frozen drinks or mixed cocktails that have juice in them.</detail><detail>Skip your dessert, or share it with someone. </detail></h2><h2 title="Fast Food"><text>Try these tips to limit calories when eating in fast food restaurants:</text><detail>Choose a place that broils or grills hamburgers, fish, and chicken for their sandwiches.</detail><detail>Order your sandwich without mayo or "special sauce."</detail><detail>Order only a sandwich. Avoid ordering the value or combo meal unless the restaurant offers healthy sides such as apple slices or a side salad.</detail><detail>Whether it is a sandwich, milkshake, or French fries, stay away from large sizes.</detail><detail>Order a salad instead of French fries.</detail><detail>Pizza is OK, but limit yourself to only one or two slices. Replace some of the cheese with extra sauce. Add a salad to your meal. </detail></h2><h2 title="Healthy Eating at All Types of Restaurants"><text>Sandwich restaurants or deli counters allow you to better manage what you eat:</text><detail>Choose low- fat turkey, chicken, or ham. Most cold-cuts are high in sodium.</detail><detail>Avoid tuna and chicken salads which are often made with lots of mayonnaise.</detail><detail>Replace extra meat and cheese with vegetables, such as peppers, cucumbers, tomatoes, and spinach.</detail><detail>Ask for an open-faced sandwich. Ask for whole-grain bread rather than white bread.</detail><detail>Replace high calorie condiments like mayonnaise or creamy salad dressings with mustard or a small amount of olive oil and vinegar. Ask that your bread be grilled or toasted without added butter. </detail><text>Chinese restaurants offer healthy choices if you are careful:</text><detail>Most deep fried options are high in calories. Instead, choose dishes that are steamed without added oil or sugar.</detail><detail>Limit dishes made with sweet and sour, hoisin, gravy, or other heavy sauces.</detail><detail>Choose low-fat dishes that are lightly stir-fried, such as brown rice and Chinese vegetables with seafood, chicken, or bean curd (tofu).</detail><detail>Order a side of steamed vegetables to pair with your noodle or rice dish.</detail><detail>Some healthy choices include wonton soup, chicken skewer, and moo goo gai pan. </detail><text>Indian restaurants:</text><detail>Select foods that have chickpeas or lentils, vegetables, and sauces made from yogurt.</detail><detail>Good choices include mulligatawny soup, tandoori chicken, chicken tikka, kebabs, whole-wheat naan bread, and lassi.</detail><detail>Avoid fried foods, creamy curry sauces, cream sauces such as Korma or Makhani, and foods made with coconut milk or a clarified butter call ghee. </detail><text>Italian restaurants:</text><detail>Pasta dishes with a red or marinara sauce are healthier than sauces made with cream, butter, or cheese, or pesto.</detail><detail>Look for the word primavera, which will not include creamy sauce. Order dishes with seafood, grilled meat, fish, chicken, or vegetables.</detail><detail>Avoid lasagna, antipasto, alfredo sauce, and garlic bread.</detail><detail>Avoid fried or breaded dishes like chicken and eggplant parmesan or parmigiana.</detail><detail>Watch out for large servings of pasta. Pair your pasta with a side salad so you're not tempted to overeat. </detail><text>Mexican or Southwestern restaurants:</text><detail>Choose foods that are not fried and have only a small amount of cheese.</detail><detail>Guacamole is a healthier choice than sour cream, but be careful to not eat too large of a portion.</detail><detail>Good choices include gazpacho, chicken with brown rice, rice and black beans, and items that are baked.</detail><detail>Avoid nachos, chips, and quesadillas. </detail><text>Family restaurants and pub food:</text><detail>Stick with grilled chicken and meats, or a pot roast or meatloaf.</detail><detail>Stay away from foods, even vegetables, that are fried, breaded, au gratin, or creamy. Order a small or medium-sized baked potato with a touch of butter or low-fat sour cream rather than French fries or mashed potatoes.</detail><detail>Salads are a great idea, but avoid creamy dressings, along with toppings such as cheese or bacon. Ask for your dressing on the side so you can control how much you eat.</detail><detail>Clear broth soups are most often best. Avoid thicker soups with cream or cheese in them.</detail><detail>Review the tips above in the section about sandwich restaurants and deli counters.</detail><detail>Watch out for larger portion sizes. </detail></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>Weight-loss - eating out; Healthy diet - eating out; Obesity - eating out</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 8/14/2016"><text>Updated by: Emily Wax, RD, The Brooklyn Hospital Center, Brooklyn, NY.

<item><title>Eating habits and behaviors</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000349.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>Food gives our bodies the energy we need to function. Food is also a part of traditions and culture. This can mean that eating has an emotional component as well. For many people, changing eating habits is very hard.</text><text>You may have had certain eating habits for so long that you do not realize they are unhealthy. Or, your habits have become part of your daily life, so you do not think much about them.</text></h2><h2 title="Keep a Journal"><text>A food journal is a good tool to help you learn about your eating habits. Keep a food journal for 1 week.</text><detail>Write down what you eat, how much, and what times of the day you are eating.</detail><detail>Include notes about what else you were doing and how you were feeling, such as being hungry, stressed, tired, or bored. For example, maybe you were at work and were bored, so you got a snack from a vending machine down the hall from your desk.</detail><detail>At the end of the week, review your journal and look at your eating patterns. Decide which habits you want to change. </detail><text>Remember, small steps toward change lead to more success in making long-term changes. Try not to overwhelm yourself with too many goals. It is a good idea to limit your focus to no more than 2 to 3 goals at one time.</text><text>Also, take a look at the healthy habits you have and be proud of yourself about them. Try not to judge your behaviors too harshly. It is easy to focus only on your poor habits. This can make you feel stressed and give up trying to change.</text><text>Taking on new, healthier habits may mean that you:</text><detail>Drink skim or low-fat (1%) milk instead of 2% or whole milk.</detail><detail>Drink more water throughout the day.</detail><detail>Eat fruit for dessert instead of cookies.</detail><detail>Plan and prepare healthy meals and snacks to increase your chance of success.</detail><detail>Keep healthy snacks at work. Pack healthy lunches that you make at home.</detail><detail>Pay attention to your feelings of hunger. Learn the difference between physical hunger and habitual eating or eating as a response to stress or boredom. </detail></h2><h2 title="Now Reflect"><text>Think about what triggers or prompts may be causing some of your eating habits.</text><detail>Is there something around you that makes you eat when you are not hungry or choose unhealthy snacks often?</detail><detail>Does the way you feel make you want to eat? </detail><text>Look at your journal and circle any regular or repetitive triggers. Some of these might be:</text><detail>You see your favorite snack in the pantry or vending machine</detail><detail>When you watch television</detail><detail>You feel stressed by something at work or in another area of your life</detail><detail>You have no plan for dinner after a long day</detail><detail>You go to work events where food is served</detail><detail>You stop at fast-food restaurants for breakfast and choose high fat, high calorie foods</detail><detail>You need a pick-me-up toward the end of your workday </detail><text>Start by focusing on one or two triggers that occur most often during your week. Think about what you can do to avoid those triggers, such as:</text><detail>DO NOT walk past the vending machine to get to your desk, if possible.</detail><detail>Decide what you will have for dinner early in the day so that you have a plan after work.</detail><detail>Keep unhealthy snacks out of your house. If someone else in your household buys these snacks, devise a plan to keep them out of sight.</detail><detail>Suggest having fruits and vegetables during workplace meetings, instead of sweets. Or bring healthier selections in for yourself.</detail><detail>Swap out juice or soda for sparkling water. </detail></h2><h2 title="Replace Your old Habits with New, Healthy Ones"><text>Find healthy choices for snacks and plan ahead:</text><detail>If you are in the habit of eating candy at the end of the day for energy, try having a cup (240 milliliters) of herbal tea and a small handful of almonds. Or, take a quick walk when you're feeling an energy low.</detail><detail>Eat fruit and yogurt in the mid-afternoon about 3 or 4 hours after lunch. </detail><text>Control your portion sizes. It is hard to eat only a few chips or other tempting foods when there is a lot in front of you. Take only a small portion and put the rest away. Eat on a plate or in a bowl instead of straight out of a bag.</text><text>Eat slowly: </text><detail>Put down your fork between bites.</detail><detail>Wait until you have swallowed your mouthful of food before taking the next bite. </detail><text>Eating too quickly leads to overeating when the food you have eaten has not yet reached your stomach and told your brain you are full. You will know you are eating too quickly if you feel stuffed about 20 minutes after you stop eating.</text><text>Eat only when you are hungry:</text><detail>Eating when you feel worried, tense, or bored also leads to overeating. Instead, call a friend or go for a walk to help you feel better.</detail><detail>Give your body and your brain time to relax from the stress of daily life. Take a mental or physical break to help you feel better without turning to food as a reward. </detail><text>Get rid of unhealthy foods:</text><detail>Replace your candy dish with a bowl of fruit or nuts.</detail><detail>When you do have unhealthy foods in your house, put them in a place that is hard for you to reach rather than out on the counter. </detail><text>Plan your meals: </text><detail>Know what you will eat ahead of time so you can avoid buying unhealthy foods (impulse buying) or eating at fast-food restaurants.</detail><detail>Plan your dinners at the beginning of the week so you can prepare healthy, well-balanced meals each evening.</detail><detail>Prepare some dinner components ahead of time (such as chopping vegetables.) This will allow you to put together a healthy meal more quickly at the end of the day. </detail><text>Breakfast sets the tone for the day. A hearty, healthy breakfast will give your body the energy it needs to get you to lunch. If you are not hungry when you wake up, you could try a glass of milk or a small fruit and dairy-based smoothie.</text><text>Plan a good lunch that will satisfy you, and a healthy afternoon snack that will keep you from becoming too hungry before dinner time. </text><text>Avoid skipping meals. Missing a regular meal or snack often leads to overeating or making unhealthy choices.</text><text>Once you have changed 1 or 2 old unhealthy habits, try changing 1 or 2 more. </text></h2><h2 title="Practice Helps"><text>It may take a while before you can turn your unhealthy habits into new, healthy ones. Remember, it took you a while to form your habits. And it may take just as long to change them. DO NOT give up.</text><text>If you start an old habit again, think about why you went back to it. Try again to replace it with a new habit. One slip does not mean you are a failure. Keep trying!</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 5/7/2017"><text>Updated by: Emily Wax, RD, The Brooklyn Hospital Center, Brooklyn, NY.

<item><title>E-cigarettes and E-hookahs</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000761.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>Electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) and electronic hookahs (e-hookahs) allow the user to inhale a vapor that may contain nicotine as well as other flavors and chemicals. Many e-cigarettes and e-hookahs look just like real cigarettes or pipes. But some look like pens or USB memory sticks. Not much is known yet about the benefits and risks of these products.</text></h2><h2 title="How They Work"><text>There are many types of e-cigarettes and e-hookahs. Most have a battery-operated heating device. When you inhale, the heater turns on and heats a liquid cartridge into a vapor. The cartridge may contain nicotine or other flavors or chemicals. It also contains glycerol or propylene glycol (PEG), which looks like smoke when you exhale. Each cartridge can be used a few times. Cartridges come in many flavors.</text></h2><h2 title="Uses"><text>The makers of e-cigarettes and e-hookahs market their products for several uses:</text><detail>To use as a safer alternative to tobacco products. The makers claim their products do not contain the harmful chemicals found in regular cigarettes. They say this makes their products safer choices for those who already smoke and don't want to quit.</detail><detail>To "smoke" without getting addicted. Consumers can choose cartridges that do not contain nicotine, the addictive substance found in tobacco.</detail><detail>To "smoke" in areas where smoking is banned. Since there are not yet bans against e-cigarettes in many places, these products allow smokers to "smoke" in smoke-free areas.</detail><detail>To use as a tool to help you quit smoking. Some companies tout their products as a way to quit smoking. More studies are needed to prove this claim. </detail><text>E-cigarettes have not been fully tested. So, it is not yet known if any of these claims are true.</text></h2><h2 title="Safety Concerns"><text>Health experts have many concerns about the safety of e-cigarettes and e-hookahs.</text><detail>There is no evidence that shows these products are safe to use over the long term.</detail><detail>There are chemicals that can cause cancer in some of the products they tested. One sample contained a toxic ingredient found in antifreeze.</detail><detail>The ingredients in e-cigarettes are not labeled, so it is not clear what's in them.</detail><detail>It is not known how much nicotine is in each cartridge. The FDA found nicotine in one sample that was labeled nicotine-free.</detail><detail>It is not known if these devices are a safe or effective way to quit smoking.</detail><detail>Non-smokers may start using e-cigarettes because they believe these devices are safe. </detail></h2><h2 title="E-cigarettes and Children"><text>Many experts also have concerns about the effects of these products on children.</text><detail>These products are sold in flavors that may appeal to children and teens, such as chocolate and key lime pie. This could lead to more nicotine addiction in children.</detail><detail>Teens who use e-cigarettes may be more likely to take up smoking regular cigarettes. </detail></h2><h2 title="More Studies are Needed"><text>There is not enough information about e-cigarettes to know if they are safe or harmful. Until more is known about their long-term effects, the FDA and the American Cancer Association recommend steering clear of these devices.</text><text>If you are trying to quit smoking, your best bet is to use FDA-approved smoking cessation aids. These include:</text><detail>Nicotine gum</detail><detail>Lozenges</detail><detail>Skin patches</detail><detail>Nasal spray and oral inhaled products </detail></h2><h2 title="When to Call the Doctor"><text>If you need more help quitting, talk with your health care provider.</text></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>Electronic cigarettes; Electronic hookahs; Vaping; Electronic nicotine delivery systems; Smoking - electronic cigarettes</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 4/15/2018"><text>Updated by: Linda J.

Stop any physical activity that causes pain, and keep your foot still when possible.</detail><detail>Ice your foot for 20 minutes 2 to 3 times a day. DO NOT apply ice directly to your skin.</detail><detail>Keep your foot raised to help keep swelling down.</detail><detail>Take pain medicine if you need it. </detail><text>For pain, you can use ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn), or acetaminophen (Tylenol). You can buy these pain medicines at the store.</text><detail>Talk with your provider before using these medicines if you have heart disease, high blood pressure, kidney disease, or have had stomach ulcers or internal bleeding in the past.</detail><detail>DO NOT take more than the amount recommended on the bottle or by your provider. </detail></h2><h2 title="Activity"><text>You can begin light activity once the pain has decreased and the swelling has gone down. Slowly increase the amount of walking or activity each day.</text><text>There may be some soreness and stiffness when you walk. This will go away once the muscles and ligaments in your foot begin to stretch and strengthen.</text><text>Your provider or physical therapist can give you exercises to help strengthen the muscles and ligaments in your foot. These exercises can also help prevent future injury.</text><text>Tips:</text><detail>During activity, you should wear a stable and protective shoe. A stiffer sole shoe can protect your foot. Walking bare foot or in flip flops can make your sprain worse.</detail><detail>If you feel any sharp pain, stop the activity.</detail><detail>Ice your foot after activity if you have any discomfort.</detail><detail>Wear a boot if your provider suggests it. This can protect your foot and allow your ligaments to heal better.</detail><detail>Talk to your provider before returning to any high impact activity or sport. </detail></h2><h2 title="Follow-up"><text>You may not need to see your provider again if your injury is healing as expected. You may need additional follow up visits if the injury is more severe. </text></h2><h2 title="When to Call the Doctor"><text>Call the health care provider if: </text><detail>You have sudden numbness or tingling.</detail><detail>You have sudden increase in pain or swelling.</detail><detail>The injury does not seem to be healing as expected.</detail></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>

<item><title>Foot amputation - discharge</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000013.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>You have had a foot amputation. You may have had an accident, or your foot may have had an infection or disease and doctors could not save it.</text></h2><h2 title="What to Expect at Home"><text>You may feel sad, angry, frustrated, or depressed. All of these feelings are normal and may arise in the hospital or when you get home.</text><text>It will take time for you to learn to use a walker and a wheelchair. It will also take time to learn to get in and out of the wheelchair. </text><text>You may be getting a prosthesis, a man-made part to replace your limb that was removed. You will have to wait for the prosthesis to be made. When you have it, getting used to it will take time.</text><text>You may have pain in your limb for several days after the surgery. You may also have a feeling that your limb is still there. This is called phantom sensation.</text></h2><h2 title="Self-care"><text>Family and friends can help. Talking with them about your feelings may make you feel better. They can also help you do things around your house and when you go out.</text><text>If you feel sad or depressed, ask your health care provider about seeing a mental health counselor for help with your feelings about your amputation.</text><text>If you have diabetes, keep your blood sugar under control.</text><text>If you have poor blood flow to your foot, follow your provider's instructions for diet and medicines.</text><text>You may eat your normal foods when you get home.</text><text>If you smoke before your injury, stop after your surgery. Smoking can affect blood flow and slow down healing. Ask your provider for help on how to quit.</text></h2><h2 title="Wound and Foot Care"><text>DO NOT use your limb until your provider tells you it is OK. This will be at least 2 weeks or longer after your surgery. DO NOT put any weight at all on your wound. DO NOT even touch it to the ground, unless your doctor says so. DO NOT drive.</text><text>Keep the wound clean and dry. DO NOT take a bath, soak your wound, or swim. If your doctor says you can, clean the wound gently with mild soap. DO NOT rub the wound. Only allow water to flow gently over it.</text><text>After your wound heals, keep it open to the air unless your doctor or nurse tells you something different. After dressings have been removed, wash your stump with mild soap and water every day. DO NOT soak it. Dry it well.</text><text>Inspect your limb every day. Use a mirror if it is hard for you to see all around it. Look for any red areas or dirt.</text><text>Wear your elastic bandage or shrinker sock on the stump all the time. If you are using an elastic bandage, rewrap it every 2 to 4 hours. Make sure there are no creases in it. Wear your stump protector whenever you are out of bed.</text><text>Ask your provider for help with pain. Two things that may help include:</text><detail>Tapping along the scar and in small circles along the stump, if it is not painful</detail><detail>Rubbing the scar and stump gently with linen or soft cotton </detail><text>Practice transfers with or without prosthesis at home.</text><detail>Go from your bed to your wheelchair, a chair, or the toilet.</detail><detail>Go from a chair to your wheelchair.</detail><detail>Go from your wheelchair to the toilet. </detail><text>If you use a walker, stay as active as you can with it.</text><text>Keep your stump at or above the level of your heart when you are lying down. When you are sitting, DO NOT cross your legs. It can stop the blood flow to your stump.</text></h2><h2 title="When to Call the Doctor"><text>Call your provider if:</text><detail>Your stump looks redder, or there are red streaks on your skin going up your leg</detail><detail>Your skin feels warmer to touch</detail><detail>There is swelling or bulging around the wound</detail><detail>There is new drainage or bleeding from the wound</detail><detail>There are new openings in the wound, or the skin around the wound is pulling away</detail><detail>Your temperature is above 101.5°F (38.6°C) more than once</detail><detail>Your skin around the stump or wound is dark or is turning black</detail><detail>Your pain is worse and your pain medicines are not controlling it</detail><detail>Your wound has gotten larger</detail><detail>A foul smell is coming from the wound </detail></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>Amputation - foot - discharge; Trans-metatarsal amputation - discharge</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 4/9/2018"><text>Updated by: C.

<item><title>Fire safety at home</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000390.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>Smoke alarms or detectors work even when you cannot smell smoke. Tips for proper use include:</text><detail>Install them in hallways, in or near all sleeping areas, the kitchen, and garage.</detail><detail>Test them once a month. Change the batteries regularly or at least once a year.</detail><detail>Dust or vacuum over the smoke alarm as needed. </detail><text>Using a fire extinguisher can put out a small fire to keep it from getting out of control. Tips for use include:</text><detail>Keep fire extinguishers in handy locations, at least one on each level of your home.</detail><detail>Be sure to have a fire extinguisher in your kitchen and one in your garage.</detail><detail>Know how to use a fire extinguisher. Teach everyone in your family how to use one, too. In an emergency, you must be able to act fast. </detail></h2><h2 title="Escaping Fires"><text>Fires can be loud, burn fast, and produce a lot of smoke. It is a good idea for everyone to know how to get out of their home quickly if one occurs.</text><text>Set up fire escape routes from every room in your house. It is best to have 2 ways to get out of each room, since one of the ways may be blocked by smoke or fire. Have twice-a-year fire drills to practice escaping.</text><text>Teach family members what to do in case of a fire. </text><detail>Smoke rises during a fire. So the safest place to be when escaping is down low to the ground.</detail><detail>Exiting through a door is best, when possible. Always feel the door starting at the bottom and work upward before opening it. If the door is hot, there may be fire on the other side.</detail><detail>Have a safe spot planned ahead of time for everyone to meet outside after escape.</detail><detail>Never go back inside for anything. Stay outside. </detail></h2><h2 title="Preventing Fires"><text>To prevent fires:</text><detail>DO NOT smoke in bed.</detail><detail>Keep matches and other flammable materials out of reach of children.</detail><detail>Never leave a burning candle or fireplace unattended. Do not stand too close to the fire.</detail><detail>Never put clothes or anything else over a lamp or heater.</detail><detail>Make sure household wiring is up-to-date.</detail><detail>Unplug appliances such as heating pads and electric blankets when they are not in use.</detail><detail>Store flammable materials away from heat sources, water heaters, and open-flame space heaters.</detail><detail>When cooking or grilling, do not leave the stove or grill unattended.</detail><detail>Be sure to close the valve on a propane cylinder tank when it is not in use. Know how to store the tank safely. </detail><text>Teach children about fires. Explain how they are accidentally started and how to prevent them. Children should understand the following:</text><detail>Do not touch or get close to radiators or heaters.</detail><detail>Never stand close to the fireplace or wood stove.</detail><detail>Do not touch matches, lighters, or candles. Tell an adult right away if you see any of these items.</detail><detail>Do not cook without asking an adult first.</detail><detail>Never play with electrical cords or stick anything into a socket.</detail><text>Children's sleepwear should be snug-fitting and specifically labeled as flame-resistant. Using other clothing, including loose-fitting garments, increases the risk for severe burns if these items catch fire.</text><text>DO NOT allow children to handle or play with fireworks. Many places in the United States do not permit lighting fireworks in residential areas. Go to public displays if your family wants to enjoy fireworks.</text><text>If oxygen therapy is being used in your home, teach everyone in the family about oxygen safety to prevent fires.</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 9/5/2017"><text>Updated by: Neil K.

<item><title>Femur fracture repair - discharge</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000166.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>You had a fracture (break) in the femur in your leg. It is also called the thigh bone. You may have needed surgery to repair the bone. You may have had surgery called an open reduction internal fixation. In this surgery, your surgeon will make a cut to open your fracture.</text><text>Your surgeon will then use special metal devices to hold your bones in place while they heal. These devices are called internal fixators. The complete name of this surgery is open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF).</text><text>In the most common surgery to repair a femur fracture, the surgeon inserts a rod or large nail into the center of the bone. This rod helps support the bone until it heals. The surgeon may also put a plate next to your bone that is attached by screws. Sometimes, fixation devices are attached to a frame outside your leg.</text></h2><h2 title="What to Expect at Home"><text>Recovery most often takes 4 to 6 months. The length of your recovery will depend on how severe your fracture is, whether you have skin wounds, and how severe they are. Recovery also depends on whether your nerves and blood vessels were injured, and what treatment you had.</text><text>Most of the time, the rods and plates used to help the bone heal will not need to be removed in a later surgery.</text></h2><h2 title="Wound Care"><text>You may be able to start showering again about 5 to 7 days after your surgery. Ask your health care provider when you can start.</text><text>Take special care when showering. Follow your provider's instructions closely.</text><detail>If you are wearing a leg brace or immobilizer, cover it with plastic to keep it dry while you shower.</detail><detail>If you are not wearing a leg brace or immobilizer, carefully wash your incision with soap and water when your provider says this is OK. Gently pat it dry. DO NOT rub the incision or put creams or lotions on it.</detail><detail>Sit on a shower stool to avoid falling while showering. </detail><text>DO NOT soak in a bathtub, swimming pool, or hot tub until your provider says it is OK.</text><text>Change your dressing (bandage) over your incision every day. Gently wash the wound with soap and water and pat it dry. </text><text>Check your incision for any signs of infection at least once a day. These signs include more redness, more drainage, or the wound is opening up.</text><text>Tell all of your providers, including your dentist, that you have a rod or pin in your leg. You may need to take antibiotics before dental work and other medical procedures to reduce your risk of getting an infection. This is more often needed early after the surgery.</text></h2><h2 title="Home Setup "><text>Have a bed that is low enough so that your feet touch the floor when you sit on the edge of the bed.</text><text>Keep tripping hazards out of your home.</text><detail>Learn how to prevent falls. Remove loose wires or cords from areas you walk through to get from one room to another. Remove loose throw rugs. DO NOT keep small pets in your home. Fix any uneven flooring in doorways. Have good lighting.</detail><detail>Make your bathroom safe. Put hand rails in the bathtub or shower and next to the toilet. Place a slip-proof mat in the bathtub or shower.</detail><detail>DO NOT carry anything when you are walking around. You may need your hands to help you balance.</detail><text>Put things where they are easy to reach. </text><text>Set up your home so that you do not have to climb steps. Some tips are:</text><detail>Set up a bed or use a bedroom on the first floor.</detail><detail>Have a bathroom or a portable commode on the same floor where you spend most of your day. </detail><text>If you do not have someone to help you at home for the first 1 to 2 weeks, ask your provider about having a trained caregiver come to your home to help you. This person can check the safety of your home and help you with your daily activities.</text><text>Follow the instructions your provider or physical therapist gave you about when you can start putting weight on your leg. You may not be able to put all, some, or any weight on your leg for a while. Make sure you know the correct way to use a cane, crutches, or walker.</text><text>Be sure to do the exercises you were taught to help build strength and flexibility as you recover.</text><text>Be careful not to stay in same position for too long.

Most of your baby's calories should still come from breast milk or formula.</detail><detail>Breast milk is not a good source of iron. So after 6 months, your baby will start to need more iron. Start solid feedings with iron-fortified baby cereal mixed with breast milk or formula. Mix it with enough milk so that the texture is very thin. Start by offering the cereal 2 times a day, in just a few spoonfuls.</detail><detail>You can make the mixture thicker as your baby learns to control it in their mouth.</detail><detail>You can also introduce iron-rich pureed meats, fruits, and vegetables. Try green peas, carrots, sweet potatoes, squash, applesauce, pears, bananas, and peaches.</detail><detail>Some dietitians recommend introducing a few vegetables before fruits. The sweetness of fruit may make some vegetables less appealing.</detail><detail>The amount your child eats will vary between 2 tablespoons (30 grams) and 2 cups (480 grams) of fruits and vegetables per day. How much your child eats depends on their size and how well they eat fruits and vegetables. </detail><text>There are several ways you can tell that your baby is ready to eat solid foods:</text><detail>Your baby's birth weight has doubled.</detail><detail>Your baby can control their head and neck movements.</detail><detail>Your baby can sit up with some support.</detail><detail>Your baby can show you they are full by turning their head away or by not opening their mouth.</detail><detail>Your baby begins showing interest in food when others are eating. </detail><text>You should also know:</text><detail>Never give honey to your baby. It may contain bacteria that can cause botulism, a rare, but serious illness.</detail><detail>Do not give your baby cow's milk until they are 1 year old. Babies under age 1 have a difficult time digesting cow's milk.</detail><detail>Never put your child to bed with a bottle. This can cause tooth decay. If your baby wants to suck, give them a pacifier.</detail><detail>Use a small spoon when feeding your baby.</detail><detail>It is fine to start to give your baby water between feedings.</detail><detail>Do not give your baby cereal in a bottle unless your pediatrician or dietitian recommends it, for example, for reflux.</detail><detail>Only offer your child new foods when they are hungry.</detail><detail>Introduce new foods one at a time, waiting 2 to 3 days between. That way you can watch for allergic reactions. Signs of an allergy include diarrhea, rash, or vomiting.</detail><detail>Avoid foods with added salt or sugar.</detail><detail>Feed your baby directly from the jar only if you use the entire jar contents. Otherwise, use a dish to prevent food-borne illness.</detail><detail>Opened containers of baby's food should be covered and stored in a refrigerator for no longer than 2 days. </detail><text>8 to 12 MONTHS OF AGE</text><text>At this age, you can offer finger foods in small amounts. Your baby will probably let you know they are ready to start feeding themselves by grabbing the food or spoon with their hand.</text><text>Good finger foods include:</text><detail>Soft cooked vegetables</detail><detail>Washed and peeled fruits</detail><detail>Graham crackers</detail><detail>Melba toast</detail><detail>Noodles </detail><text>You can also introduce teething foods, such as:</text><detail>Toast strips</detail><detail>Unsalted crackers and bagels</detail><detail>Teething biscuits </detail><text>Continue to offer your baby breast milk or formula 3 to 4 times per day at this age.</text><text>You should also know:</text><detail>Avoid foods that may cause choking, such as apple chunks or slices, grapes, berries, raisins, dry flake cereals, hot dogs, sausages, peanut butter, popcorn, nuts, seeds, round candies, and raw vegetables.</detail><detail>You can give your child egg yolks 3 to 4 times per week. Some babies are sensitive to egg whites. So do not offer them until after age 1.</detail><detail>You can offer small amounts of cheese, cottage cheese, and yogurt, but no cow's milk.</detail><detail>By age 1, most children are off the bottle. If your child still uses a bottle, it should contain water only. </detail><text>1 YEAR of AGE</text><detail>At this age, you may give your baby whole milk in place of breast milk or formula.</detail><detail>Most mothers in the United States wean their babies by this age. But it is also fine to continue to nurse if you and your baby want to.</detail><detail>Do not give your child low-fat milk (2%, 1%, or skim) until after age 2. Your baby needs the extra calories from fat to grow and develop.</detail><detail>At this age, your baby will get most of their nutrition from proteins, fruits and vegetables, breads and grains, and dairy. You can make sure your baby gets all the vitamins and minerals they need by offering a variety of foods.</detail><detail>Your child will start to crawl and walk and be much more active. They will eat smaller amounts at a time, but will eat more often (4 to 6 times a day). Having snacks on hand is a good idea.</detail><detail>At this age, their growing slows. They will not double in size like they did when they were an infant. </detail><text>You should also know:</text><detail>If your child dislikes a new food, try giving it again later. Often it takes several tries for children to take to new foods.</detail><detail>Do not give your child sweets or sweetened beverages. They can spoil their appetite and cause tooth decay.</detail><detail>Avoid salt, strong spices, and caffeine products, including soft drinks, coffee, tea, and chocolate.</detail><detail>If your baby is fussy, they may need attention, rather than food. </detail><text>2 YEARS of AGE</text><detail>After your child turns 2, your child's diet should be moderately low in fat. A high-fat diet can lead to heart disease, obesity, and other health problems later in life.</detail><detail>Your child should eat a variety of foods from each of the food groups: breads and grains, proteins, fruits and vegetables, and dairy.</detail><detail>If your water is not fluoridated, it is a good idea to use toothpaste or mouthwash with fluoride added. </detail><text>All children need plenty of calcium to support their growing bones. But not all kids get enough. Good sources of calcium include:</text><detail>Low-fat or nonfat milk, yogurt, and cheese</detail><detail>Cooked greens</detail><detail>Canned salmon (with bones) </detail><text>If your child's diet is balanced and healthy, they should not need a vitamin supplement. Some kids are picky eaters, but usually they still get all the nutrients they need. If you are concerned, ask your health care provider whether your child needs a children's multivitamin.</text></h2><h2 title="When to Call the Doctor"><text>Call the provider if you are concerned your child:</text><detail>Is not eating enough</detail><detail>Is eating too much</detail><detail>Is gaining too much or too little weight</detail><detail>Has an allergic reaction to food </detail></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>Feeding children 6 months to 2 years; Diet - age appropriate - children 6 months to 2 years; Babies - feeding solid food</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 9/5/2017"><text>Updated by: Neil K.

<item><title>Fecal immunochemical test (FIT)</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000704.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>The fecal immunochemical test (FIT) is a screening test for colon cancer. It tests for hidden blood in the stool, which can be an early sign of cancer. FIT only detects human blood from the lower intestines. Medicines and food do not interfere with the test. So it tends to be more accurate and have fewer false positive results than other tests. </text></h2><h2 title="How the Test is Performed"><text>You will be given the test to use at home. Be sure to follow the instructions provided. Most tests have the following steps:</text><detail>Flush the toilet before having a bowel movement.</detail><detail>Put the used toilet paper in the waste bag provided. Do not put it into the toilet bowl.</detail><detail>Use the brush from the kit to brush the surface of the stool and then dip the brush into the toilet water.</detail><detail>Touch the brush on the space indicated on the test card.</detail><detail>Add the brush to the waste bag and throw it away.</detail><detail>Send the sample to the lab for testing.</detail><detail>Your doctor may ask you to test more than one stool sample before sending it in. </detail></h2><h2 title="How to Prepare for the Test"><text>You do not need to do anything to prepare for the test.</text></h2><h2 title="How the Test will Feel"><text>Some people may be squeamish about collecting the sample. But you will not feel anything during the test.</text></h2><h2 title="Why the Test is Performed"><text>Blood in the stool may be an early sign of colon cancer. This test is performed to detect blood in the stool that you cannot see. This type of screening can detect problems that can be treated before cancer develops or spreads.</text><text>Talk with your doctor about when you should have colon screenings.</text></h2><h2 title="Normal Results"><text>A normal result means the test did not detect any blood in the stool. However, because cancers in the colon may not always bleed, you may need to do the test a few times to confirm that there is no blood in your stool.</text></h2><h2 title="What Abnormal Test Results Mean"><text>If the FIT results come back positive for blood in the stool, your doctor will want to perform other tests, usually including a colonoscopy. The FIT test does not diagnose cancer. Screening tests such as a sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy can also help detect cancer. Both the FIT test and other screenings can catch colon cancer early, when it is easier to treat. </text></h2><h2 title="Risks"><text>There are no risks from using the FIT.</text></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>Immunochemical fecal occult blood test; iFOBT; Colon cancer screening - FIT</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 8/1/2017"><text>Updated by: Subodh K.

<item><title>Fast food tips</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000105.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>Many fast foods are high in calories, fat, salt, and sugar. Use these tips to guide you in making healthier choices when eating in a fast food restaurant.</text></h2><h2 title="Can you eat Fast Food?"><text>Fast foods are quick and easy substitutes for home cooking. But fast foods are almost always high in calories, fat, sugar, and salt.</text><text>Some restaurants still use hydrogenated vegetable oils for frying. These oils contain trans fats. These fats increase your risk for heart disease. Some cities have banned or are trying to ban the use of these fats.</text><text>Now, many restaurants are preparing foods using other types of fat. Some offer low-calorie choices instead.</text><text>Even with these changes, it is hard to eat healthy when you eat out often. Many foods are still cooked with a lot of fat. Many restaurants do not offer any lower-fat foods. Large portions also make it easy to overeat. And few restaurants offer many fresh fruits and vegetables.</text><text>In general, people with high blood pressure, diabetes, and heart disease must be very careful about eating fast food.</text></h2><h2 title="When you go to a Fast Food Restaurant"><text>Knowing the amount of calories, fat, and salt in fast foods can help you eat healthier. Many restaurants now offer information about their food. This information is much like the nutrition labels on the food that you buy. If it is not posted in the restaurant, ask an employee for a copy.</text><text>In general, eat at places that offer salads, soups, and vegetables. In your salads, avoid high-fat items. Dressing, bacon bits, and shredded cheese all add fat and calories. Choose lettuce and assorted vegetables. Select low-fat or fat-free salad dressings, vinegar, or lemon juice. Ask for salad dressing on the side.</text><text>Healthier sandwiches include regular or junior size lean meats. Adding bacon, cheese, or mayo will increase the fat and calories. Ask for vegetables instead. Select whole-grain breads or bagels. Croissants and biscuits have a lot of fat.</text><text>If you want a hamburger, get a single meat patty without cheese and sauce. Ask for extra lettuce, tomatoes, and onions. Limit how many French fries you eat. Ketchup has a lot of calories from sugar. Ask if you can get a side salad instead of fries. </text><text>Look for meats, chicken, and fish that are roasted, grilled, baked, or broiled. Avoid meats that are breaded or fried. If the dish you order comes with a heavy sauce, ask for it on the side and use just a small amount.</text><text>With pizza, get less cheese. Also pick low-fat toppings, such as vegetables. You can dab the pizza with a paper napkin to get rid of a lot of the fat from the cheese.</text><text>Eat low-fat desserts. A rich dessert can add fun to a well-balanced diet. But eat them only on special occasions.</text><text>Order smaller servings when you can. Split some fast-food items to reduce calories and fat. Ask for a "doggy bag." You can also leave the extra food on your plate.</text><text>Your food choices can teach your children how to eat healthy, too. Choosing a variety of healthy foods and limiting portion size are key to a healthy diet for anyone.</text></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>Obesity - fast food; Weight loss - fast food; High blood pressure - fast food; Hypertension - fast food; Cholesterol - fast food; Hyperlipidemia - fast food</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 7/12/2018"><text>Updated by: Laura J.

Of all the fats, trans fat is the worst for your health. Too much trans fat in your diet increases your risk for heart disease and other health problems. </text><text>Trans fats are made when food makers turn liquid oils into solid fats, like shortening or margarine. Trans fats can be found in many fried, "fast", packaged, or processed foods, including:</text><detail>Anything fried and battered</detail><detail>Shortening and stick margarine</detail><detail>Cakes, cake mixes, pies, pie crust </detail><text>Animal foods, such as red meats and dairy, have small amounts of trans fats.

It may also increase your risk for type 2 diabetes. Staying at a healthy weight can reduce your risk for diabetes, heart disease, and other health problems.</detail></h2><h2 title="How Much you can eat"><text>Your body does not need trans fat. So you should eat as little as possible.</text><text>Here are recommendations from the 2010 Dietary Guidelines for Americans and the American Heart Association:</text><detail>You should get no more than 25% to 30% of your daily calories from fats.</detail><detail>You should limit saturated fat to less than 10% of your daily calories.</detail><detail>You should limit trans fat to less than 1% of your daily calories. For someone with a 2,000 calorie a day diet, this is about 20 calories or 2 grams per day. </detail></h2><h2 title="Reading Nutrition Labels"><text>All packaged foods have a nutrition label that includes fat content. Food makers are required to label trans fats on nutrition and some supplement labels. Reading food labels can help you keep track of how much trans fat you eat. </text><detail>Check the total fat in 1 serving.</detail><detail>Look closely at the amount of trans fat in a serving.</detail><detail>Look for the words "partially hydrogenated" in the ingredient list. It means oils have been turned to solids and trans fats. Manufacturers can show 0 grams of trans fat if there is less than 5 grams per serving, often a small serving size shows 0 grams of trans fat, but it still might be in there. If there are multiple servings in a package, then the whole package may contain several grams of trans fat.</detail><detail>When tracking trans fat, make sure you count the number of servings you eat in 1 sitting.</detail><detail>Many fast food restaurants use solid oils with trans fat for frying. Often they provide nutrition information on their menus. If you DO NOT see it posted, ask your server. You also may be able to find it on the restaurant's website. </detail><text>Trans fats are under review for their health effects. Experts are working to limit the amount of trans fats used in packaged foods and restaurants. </text></h2><h2 title="Making Healthy Food Choices"><text>Trans fats are found in many processed and packaged foods.

You are going home after a C-section. You should expect to need help caring for yourself and your newborn. Talk to your partner, parents, in-laws, or friends.

</text></h2><h2 title="What to Expect at Home"><text>You may have bleeding from your vagina for up to 6 weeks. It will slowly become less red, then pink, and then will have more of a yellow or white color. Bleeding and discharge after delivery is called lochia.</text><text>At first, your cut (incision) will be raised slightly and pinker than the rest of your skin. It will likely appear somewhat puffy.</text><detail>Any pain should decrease after 2 or 3 days, but your cut will remain tender for up to 3 weeks or more.</detail><detail>Most women need pain medicine for the first few days to 2 weeks. Ask your provider what is safe to take while breastfeeding.</detail><detail>Over time, your scar will become thinner and flatter and will turn either white or the color of your skin. </detail><text>You will need a checkup with your health care provider in 4 to 6 weeks.</text></h2><h2 title="Incision Care"><text>If you go home with a dressing (bandage), change the dressing over your cut once a day, or sooner if it gets dirty or wet.</text><detail>Your provider will tell you when to stop keeping your wound covered.</detail><detail>Keep the wound area clean by washing it with mild soap and water. You don't need to scrub it. Often, just letting the water run over your wound in the shower is enough.</detail><detail>You may remove your wound dressing and take showers if stitches, staples, or glue were used to close your skin.</detail><detail>DO NOT soak in a bathtub or hot tub, or go swimming, until your provider tells you it is OK. In most cases, this is not until 3 weeks after surgery. </detail><text>If strips (Steri-Strips) were used to close your incision:</text><detail>DO NOT try to wash off the Steri-Strips or glue. It is OK to shower and pat your incision dry with a clean towel.</detail><detail>They should fall off in about a week. If they are still there after 10 days, you can remove them, unless your provider tells you not to.</detail></h2><h2 title="Activity"><text>Getting up and walking around once you are home will help you heal faster and can help prevent blood clots.</text><text>You should be able to do most of your regular activities in 4 to 8 weeks. Before then:</text><detail>Do not lift anything heavier than your baby for the first 6 to 8 weeks.</detail><detail>Short walks are an excellent way to increase strength and stamina. Light housework is OK. Slowly increase how much you do.</detail><detail>Expect to tire easily. Listen to your body, and don't be active to the point of exhaustion.</detail><detail>Avoid heavy housecleaning, jogging, most exercises, and any activities that make you breathe hard or strain your muscles. Do not do sit-ups. </detail><text>Don't drive a car for at least 2 weeks. It is OK to ride in a car, but make sure you wear your seat belt. Don't drive if you are taking narcotic pain medicine or if you feel weak or unsafe driving.</text></h2><h2 title="Other Self-care"><text>Try eating smaller meals than normal and have healthy snacks in between. Eat plenty of fruits and vegetables, and drink 8 cups (2 liters) of water a day to keep from getting constipated.</text><text>Any hemorrhoids you develop should slowly decrease in size. Some may go away. Methods that may help the symptoms include:</text><detail>Warm tub baths (shallow enough to keep your incision above the water level).</detail><detail>Cold compresses over the area.</detail><detail>Over-the-counter pain relievers.</detail><detail>Over-the-counter hemorrhoid ointments or suppositories.</detail><detail>Bulk laxatives to prevent constipation. If necessary, ask your provider for recommendations. </detail><text>Sex can begin any time after 6 weeks. Also, be sure to talk with your provider about contraception after pregnancy. This decision should be made before you leave the hospital.</text><text>After C-sections that follow a difficult labor, some moms feel relieved. But others feel sad, disappointed, or even guilty about needing a C-section.</text><detail>Many of these feelings are normal, even for women who had a vaginal birth.</detail><detail>Try talking with your partner, family, or friends about your feelings.</detail><detail>Seek help from your provider if these feelings do not go away or become worse. </detail></h2><h2 title="When to Call the Doctor"><text>Call your provider if you have vaginal bleeding that:</text><detail>Is still very heavy (like your menstrual period flow) after more than 4 days</detail><detail>Is light but lasts beyond 4 weeks</detail><detail>Involves the passing of large clots </detail><text>Also call your provider if you have:</text><detail>Swelling in one of your legs (it will be red and warmer than the other leg)</detail><detail>Pain in your calf</detail><detail>Redness, warmth, swelling, or drainage from your incision site, or your incision breaks open</detail><detail>Fever more than 100°F (37.8°C) that persists (swollen breasts may cause a mild elevation of temperature)</detail><detail>Increased pain in your belly</detail><detail>Discharge from your vagina that becomes heavier or develops a foul odor</detail><detail>Become very sad, depressed, or withdrawn, are having feelings of harming yourself or your baby, or are having trouble caring for yourself or your baby</detail><detail>A tender, reddened, or warm area on one breast (this may be a sign of infection) </detail><text>Postpartum preeclampsia, while rare, can occur after delivery, even if you did not have preeclampsia during your pregnancy. Call your provider right away if you:</text><detail>Have swelling in your hands, face, or eyes (edema)</detail><detail>Suddenly gain weight over 1 or 2 days, or you gain more than 2 pounds (1 kilogram) in a week</detail><detail>Have a headache that does not go away or becomes worse</detail><detail>Have vision changes, such as you cannot see for a short time, see flashing lights or spots, are sensitive to light, or have blurry vision</detail><detail>Body pain and achiness (similar to body pain with a high fever) </detail></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>Cesarean - going home</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 8/16/2018"><text>Updated by: John D.

<item><title>Glycemic index and diabetes</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000941.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>Glycemic index (GI) is a measure of how quickly a food can make your blood sugar (glucose) rise. Only foods that contain carbohydrates have a GI index. Foods such as oils, fats, and meats do not have a GI index. </text><text>In general, low GI foods increase glucose slowly in your body. Foods with a high GI increase blood glucose quickly. </text><text>If you have diabetes, high GI foods can make it harder to control diabetes. </text></h2><h2 title="Information"><text>Not all carbohydrates work the same in the body. Some trigger a quick spike in blood sugar, while others work more slowly, keeping blood sugar more even. The glycemic index addresses these differences by assigning a number to foods that reflects how quickly they increase blood glucose compared to pure glucose (sugar). </text><text>The GI scale goes from 0 to 100. Pure glucose has the highest GI and is given a value of 100. </text><text>Eating low GI foods can help you gain tighter control over your blood sugar. Paying attention to the GI of foods can be another tool to help manage diabetes, along with carbohydrate counting. Following a low-GI diet also may help with weight loss.</text></h2><h2 title="Glycemic Index of Certain Foods"><text>Low GI foods (0 to 55):</text><detail>Bulgar, barley</detail><detail>Pasta, parboiled (converted) rice</detail><detail>Quinoa</detail><detail>High-fiber bran cereal, steel-cut or rolled oatmeal</detail><detail>Carrots, non-starchy vegetables, greens</detail><detail>Apples, oranges, grapefruit, and many other fruits</detail><detail>Most nuts, legumes, and beans</detail><detail>Milk and yogurt </detail><text>Moderate GI foods (56 to 69):</text><detail>Pita bread, rye bread</detail><detail>Couscous</detail><detail>Brown rice</detail><detail>Raisins </detail><text>High GI foods (70 and higher):</text><detail>White bread and bagels</detail><detail>Most processed cereals and instant oatmeal</detail><detail>Most snack foods</detail><detail>Potatoes</detail><detail>White rice</detail><detail>Watermelon </detail></h2><h2 title="Meal Planning with the Glycemic Index"><text>When planning your meals: </text><detail>Choose foods that have a low to medium GI.</detail><detail>When eating a high GI food, combine it with low GI foods to balance the effect on your glucose levels. The GI of a food changes when you combine it with other foods. </detail><text>The GI of a food is affected by certain factors, such as the ripeness of a piece of fruit. So you need to think about more than the GI of a food when making healthy choices. When choosing meals, it's a good idea to keep these issues in mind. </text><detail>Portion size still matters because calories still matter, and so do carbohydrates. You need to keep an eye on the portion size and number of carbs in the meal you are having, even if it has low GI foods.</detail><detail>In general, processed foods have a higher GI. For example, fruit juice and instant potatoes have a higher GI than whole fruit and whole baked potato.</detail><detail>Cooking can affect the GI of a food. For example, al dente pasta has lower GI than soft-cooked pasta.</detail><detail>Foods higher in fat or fiber tend to have a lower GI.</detail><detail>Certain foods from the same class of foods can have different GI values. For example, converted long-grain white rice has a lower GI than brown rice. And short-grain white rice has a higher GI than brown rice. Likewise, quick oats or grits have high a GI but whole oats and whole-grain breakfast cereals have a lower GI.</detail><detail>Choose a variety of healthy foods keeping in mind the nutritious value of the whole meal as well as the GI of foods.</detail><detail>Some high GI foods are high in nutrients. So balance these with lower GI foods. </detail><text>For many people with diabetes, carbohydrate counting along with choosing healthy foods and maintaining a healthy weight are enough to control diabetes and lower the risk for complications. But it you have trouble controlling your blood sugar or want tighter control, you may want to talk with your health care provider about using the glycemic index as part of your action plan.</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 11/6/2016"><text>Updated by: Emily Wax, RD, The Brooklyn Hospital Center, Brooklyn, NY.

<item><title>Gleason grading system</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000920.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>Prostate cancer is diagnosed after a biopsy. One or more tissue samples are taken from the prostate and examined under the microscope. </text><text>The Gleason grading system refers to how abnormal your prostate cancer cells look and how likely the cancer is to advance and spread. A lower Gleason grade means that the cancer is slower growing and not aggressive.</text></h2><h2 title="Gleason Score"><text>The first step in determining the Gleason grade is to determine the Gleason score.</text><detail>When looking at cells under the microscope, the doctor assigns a number (or grade) to the prostate cancer cells between 1 and 5.</detail><detail>This grade is based on how abnormal the cells appear. Grade 1 means that the cells look almost like normal prostate cells. Grade 5 means that the cells look very different from normal prostate cells.</detail><detail>Most prostate cancers contain cells that are different grades. So the two most common grades are used.</detail><detail>The Gleason score is determined by adding the two most common grades. For example, the most common grade of the cells in a tissue sample may be grade 3 cells, followed by grade 4 cells. The Gleason score for this sample would be 7.</detail><text>Higher numbers indicate a faster growing cancer that is more likely to spread.</text><text>Currently the lowest score assigned to a tumor is grade 6. Scores below a 6 show normal to near normal cells. Most cancers have a Gleason score of between 5 and 7.</text></h2><h2 title="Gleason Grading System"><text>Sometimes, it can be hard to predict how well people will do based just on their Gleason scores alone.</text><detail>For example, your tumor may be assigned a Gleason score of 7 if the two most common grades were 3 and 4.The 7 may come either from adding 3 + 4 or from adding 4 + 3.</detail><detail>Overall, someone with a Gleason score of 7 that comes from adding 3 + 4 is felt to have a less aggressive cancer than someone with a Gleason score of 7 that comes from adding 4 + 3. That is because the person with a 4 + 3 =7 grade has more grade 4 cells than grade 3 cells. Grade 4 cells are more abnormal and more likely to spread than grade 3 cells. </detail><text>A new 5 Grade Group System has recently been created. This system is a better way to describe how a cancer will behave and respond to treatment.</text><detail>Grade group 1: Gleason score 6 or lower (low-grade cancer)</detail><detail>Grade group 2: Gleason score 3 + 4 = 7 (medium-grade cancer)</detail><detail>Grade group 3: Gleason score 4 + 3 = 7 (medium-grade cancer)</detail><detail>Grade group 4: Gleason score 8 (high-grade cancer)</detail><detail>Grade group 5: Gleason score 9 to 10 (high-grade cancer) </detail><text>A lower group indicates a better chance for successful treatment than a higher group. A higher group means that more of the cancer cells look different from normal cells. A higher group also means that it is more likely that the tumor will spread aggressively.</text><text>Grading helps you and your doctor determine your treatment options, along with:</text><detail>Stage of the cancer, which shows how much the cancer has spread</detail><detail>PSA test result</detail><detail>Your overall health</detail><detail>Your desire to have surgery, radiation, or hormone medicines, or no treatment at all </detail></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>Prostate cancer - Gleason; Adenocarcinoma prostate - Gleason; Gleason score; Prostate cancer - 5 grade group</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 5/31/2018"><text>Updated by: Sovrin M.

<item><title>Giving an insulin injection</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000660.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>

 
To give an insulin injection, you need to fill the right syringe with the right amount of medicine, decide where to give the injection, and know how to give the injection.
</text></h2><h2 title="Getting Ready"><text>Your health care provider or a certified diabetes educator (CDE) will teach you all of these steps, watch you practice, and answer your questions. You may take notes to remember the details.</text><text>Know the name and dose of each medicine to give. The type of insulin should match the type of syringe: </text><detail>Standard insulin contains 100 units in 1 mL. This is also called U-100 insulin. Most insulin syringes are marked for giving you U-100 insulin. Every notch on a standard 1 mL insulin syringe is 1 unit of insulin.</detail><detail>More concentrated insulins are now available. These include U-500 and U-300. Because U-500 syringes may be difficult to find, your provider may give you instructions for using U-500 insulin with U-100 syringes. Insulin syringes or concentrated insulin are now widely available. DO NOT mix or dilute their concentrated insulin with any other insulin.</detail><detail>Some types of insulin can be mixed with each other in one syringe, but many cannot be mixed. Check with your provider or pharmacist about this. </detail><text>Other general tips:</text><detail>Always use the same brands and types of supplies. DO NOT use expired insulin.</detail><detail>Insulin should be given at room temperature. If you had it in the refrigerator or cooler bag, take it out 30 minutes before the injection. Once you have started using a vial of insulin, it can be kept at room temperature for a month.</detail><detail>Gather your supplies: insulin, needles, syringes, alcohol wipes, and a container for used needles and syringes. </detail></h2><h2 title="Filling the Syringe - One Type of Insulin"><text>To fill a syringe with one type of insulin:</text><detail>Wash your hands with soap and water. Dry them well.</detail><detail>Check the insulin bottle label. Make sure it is the right insulin. Make sure it is not expired.</detail><detail>The insulin should not have any clumps on the sides of the bottle. If it does, throw it out and get another bottle.</detail><detail>Intermediate-acting insulin (N or NPH) is cloudy, and must be rolled between your hands to mix it. DO NOT shake the bottle. This can make the insulin clump.</detail><detail>Clear insulin does not need to be mixed.</detail><detail>If the insulin vial has a plastic cover, take it off. Wipe the top of the bottle with an alcohol wipe. Let it dry. DO NOT blow on it.</detail><detail>Know the dose of insulin you are going to use. Take the cap off the needle, being careful not to touch the needle to keep it sterile. Pull back the plunger of the syringe to put as much air in the syringe as the dose of medicine you want.</detail><detail>Put the needle into and through the rubber top of the insulin bottle. Push the plunger so the air goes into the bottle.</detail><detail>Keep the needle in the bottle and turn the bottle upside down.</detail><detail>With the tip of the needle in the liquid, pull back on the plunger to get the right dose of insulin into the syringe.</detail><detail>Check the syringe for air bubbles. If there are bubbles, hold both the bottle and syringe in one hand, and tap the syringe with your other hand. The bubbles will float to the top. Push the bubbles back into the insulin bottle, then pull back to get the right dose.</detail><detail>When there are no bubbles, take the syringe out of the bottle. Put the syringe down carefully so the needle does not touch anything. </detail></h2><h2 title="Filling the Syringe - Two Types of Insulin"><text>To fill a syringe with two types of insulin:</text><detail>Never mix two types of insulin in one syringe unless you are told to do this. You will also be told which insulin to draw up first. Always do it in that order.</detail><detail>Your doctor will tell you how much of each insulin you will need. Add these two numbers together. This is the amount of insulin you should have in the syringe before injecting it.</detail><detail>Wash your hands with soap and water. Dry them well.</detail><detail>Check the insulin bottle label. Make sure it is the right insulin.</detail><detail>The insulin should not have any clumps on the sides of the bottle. If it does, throw it out and get another bottle.</detail><detail>Intermediate-acting insulin is cloudy, and must be rolled between your hands to mix it. DO NOT shake the bottle. This can make the insulin clump.</detail><detail>Clear insulin does not need to be mixed.</detail><detail>If the vial has a plastic cover, take it off. Wipe the top of the bottle with an alcohol wipe. Let it dry. DO NOT blow on it.</detail><detail>Know the dose of each insulin you are going to use. Take the cap off the needle, being careful not to touch the needle to keep it sterile. Pull back the plunger of the syringe to put as much air in the syringe as the dose of the longer-acting insulin.</detail><detail>Put the needle into the rubber top of that insulin bottle. Push the plunger so the air goes into the bottle. Remove the needle from the bottle.</detail><detail>Put the air in the short-acting insulin bottle the same way as the previous two steps above.</detail><detail>Keep the needle in the short-acting bottle and turn the bottle upside down.</detail><detail>With the tip of the needle in the liquid, pull back on the plunger to get the right dose of insulin into the syringe.</detail><detail>Check the syringe for air bubbles. If there are bubbles, hold both the bottle and syringe in one hand, and tap the syringe with your other hand. The bubbles will float to the top. Push the bubbles back into the insulin bottle, then pull back to get the right dose.</detail><detail>When there are no bubbles, take the syringe out of the bottle. Look at it again to make sure you have the right dose.</detail><detail>Put the needle into the rubber top of the longer-acting insulin bottle.</detail><detail>Turn the bottle upside down. With the tip of the needle in the liquid, slowly pull back on the plunger to exactly the right dose of long-acting insulin. DO NOT draw extra insulin in the syringe, since you should not push the mixed insulin back into the bottle.</detail><detail>Check the syringe for air bubbles. If there are bubbles, hold both the bottle and syringe in one hand, and tap the syringe with your other hand. The bubbles will float to the top. Remove the needle from the bottle before you push out the air.</detail><detail>Make sure you have the right total dose of insulin. Put the syringe down carefully so the needle does not touch anything. </detail></h2><h2 title="Giving the Injection"><text>Choose where to give the injection. Keep a chart of places you have used, so you do not put the insulin in the same place all the time. Ask your doctor for a chart.</text><detail>Keep your shots 1 inch ( 2.5 centimeters, cm) away from scars and 2 inches (5 cm) away from your navel.</detail><detail>DO NOT put a shot in a spot that is bruised, swollen, or tender. </detail><text>The site you choose for the injection should be clean and dry. If your skin is visibly dirty, clean it with soap and water. DO NOT use an alcohol wipe on your injection site.</text><text>The insulin needs to go into the fat layer under the skin.</text><detail>Pinch the skin and put the needle in at a 45º angle.</detail><detail>If your tissues are thick enough, you may be able to inject straight up and down (90º angle). Check with your provider before doing this.</detail><detail>Push the needle all the way into the skin. Let go of the pinched skin. Inject the insulin slowly and steadily until it is all in.</detail><detail>Leave the syringe in place for 5 seconds after injecting. </detail><text>Pull the needle out at the same angle it went in. Put the syringe down. There is no need to recap it. If insulin tends to leak from your injection site, press the injection site for a few seconds after the injection. If this happens often, check with your health care provider. You may change the site or the injection angle.</text><text>Place the needle and syringe in a safe hard container. Close the container, and keep it safely away from children and animals. Never reuse needles or syringes.</text><text>If you're injecting more than 50 to 90 units of insulin in one injection, your provider may tell you to split the doses either at different times or using different sites for the same injection. This is because bigger volumes of insulin may get weakened without being absorbed.</text></h2><h2 title="Storing Your Insulin and Supplies"><text>Ask your pharmacist how to store your insulin so it doesn't go bad. Never put insulin in the freezer. Don't store it in your car on warm days.</text></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>Diabetes - insulin injection; Diabetic - insulin shot</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 8/7/2016"><text>Updated by: Brent Wisse, MD, Associate Professor of Medicine, Division of Metabolism, Endocrinology &amp;amp; Nutrition, University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle, WA.

<item><title>Give your heart a workout</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000763.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>Being physically active is one of the best things you can do for your heart. Regular exercise helps reduce your risk for heart disease and adds years to your life.</text><text>You do not need to spend hours in the gym every day to see benefits. Moving your body just 30 minutes a day is enough to improve your heart health.</text><text>If you have diabetes or heart disease, talk to your health care provider before starting an exercise program.</text></h2><h2 title="The Benefits of Exercise"><text>Exercise helps your heart in several ways.</text><detail>Burns calories. This can help you lose extra pounds (kilograms) or stay at a healthy weight. Being overweight is a major risk factor for heart disease.</detail><detail>Lowers blood pressure. Doing some type of moderate aerobic exercise, for 30 to 60 minutes on most days of the week, can help lower blood pressure. High blood pressure is another major risk factor for heart disease.</detail><detail>Reduces stress. Regular exercise is a proven stress buster. Experts are not sure if stress plays a direct role in heart disease. But it may contribute to other risk factors.</detail><detail>Lowers cholesterol. Exercise can lower your LDL ("bad" cholesterol level). A high LDL level is a major risk factor for heart disease. </detail></h2><h2 title="The Best Activities for Your Heart"><text>When done properly, any kind of exercise can be good for your body. But aerobic exercise is the best type for your heart. Aerobic exercise is any activity that uses the large muscles in your body and gets your heart beating faster.</text><text>To benefit your heart, experts recommend getting at least 30 minutes of moderate aerobic exercise on most days. This is about 2.5 hours a week. You can also break this up into a few 10- or 15-minute sessions each day. Moderate aerobic exercises include:</text><detail>Dancing</detail><detail>Hiking on flat ground</detail><detail>Bicycling at less than 10 mph</detail><detail>Moderate walking (about 3.5 mph)</detail><detail>Golf (not using a cart)</detail><detail>Downhill skiing</detail><detail>Tennis (doubles)</detail><detail>Softball</detail><detail>Swimming</detail><detail>Gardening</detail><detail>Light yard work </detail><text>For even more heart benefits, consider adding some vigorous activity to your week. If all your exercise is vigorous, aim to get at least 75 minutes each week. Vigorous aerobic exercises include:</text><detail>Brisk walking (about 4.5 mph)</detail><detail>Bicycling at more than 10 mph</detail><detail>Hiking uphill</detail><detail>Cross-country skiing</detail><detail>Stair climbing</detail><detail>Soccer</detail><detail>Jogging</detail><detail>Jumping rope</detail><detail>Tennis (singles)</detail><detail>Basketball</detail><detail>Heavy yard work </detail></h2><h2 title="Track the Intensity of Your Workout"><text>You can tell if your workout is moderate or vigorous by paying attention to how your body feels while you exercise.</text><text>The Borg Rating of Perceived Exertion Scale ranks exertion from 6 to 20. During exercise, choose the number that best describes how hard you are working.</text><detail>6 = No exertion</detail><detail>7 = Extremely light</detail><detail>8</detail><detail>9 = Very light, such as slow walking or easy chores</detail><detail>10</detail><detail>11 = Light</detail><detail>12</detail><detail>13 = Somewhat hard, requires effort but doesn't make you out of breath</detail><detail>14</detail><detail>15 = Hard</detail><detail>16</detail><detail>17 = Very hard, you really have to push yourself</detail><detail>18</detail><detail>19 = Extremely hard, the highest level of exercise you can keep up</detail><detail>20 = Maximal exertion </detail><text>A moderate level of exercise is usually from 12 to 14. Vigorous exercise is usually a 15 or higher. You can adjust the level of your workout by slowing down or speeding up.</text></h2><h2 title="Track Your Target Heart Rate"><text>To see the direct effects of exercise on your heart, track your target heart rate, which is about 50% to 85% of your maximum heart rate, based on your age. This range gives your heart the most benefit.</text><text>To find your target heart rate:</text><detail>Take a brief break from exercising to take your pulse. To measure your pulse at the wrist, place your index and middle fingers on the inside of your opposite wrist, below the base of the thumb. To measure your pulse at the neck, place your index and middle fingers to the side of the Adam's apple.</detail><detail>Count the number of beats you feel for 10 seconds.</detail><detail>Multiply this number by 6 to give you the beats per minute. </detail><text>Find your age and target heart rate: </text><detail>20 years old -- 100 to 170 beats per minute</detail><detail>30 years old -- 95 to 162 beats per minute</detail><detail>35 years old -- 93 to 157 beats per minute</detail><detail>40 years old -- 90 to 153 beats per minute</detail><detail>45 years old -- 88 to 149 beats per minute</detail><detail>50 years old -- 85 to 145 beats per minute</detail><detail>55 years old -- 83 to 140 beats per minute</detail><detail>60 years old -- 80 to 136 beats per minute</detail><detail>65 years old -- 78 to 132 beats per minute</detail><detail>70 years old -- 75 to 128 beats per minute </detail><text>To find your approximate maximum heart rate, subtract your age from 220. </text><text>For moderate intensity exercise, your target heart rate should be 50% to 70% of your maximum heart rate.</text><text>For vigorous exercise, your target heart rate should be 70% to 85% of your maximum heart rate.</text><text>When you first start exercising, aim for the lower number for your age range. As you get fitter, you can slowly work towards the higher number.</text><text>If your heart rate is lower than your target heart rate, you may not be exercising hard enough to benefit your heart. If your heart rate is higher than your target, you may be exercising too hard.</text><text>Some blood pressure medicines can lower your target heart rate. If you take medicine for high blood pressure, ask your doctor what range is healthy for you.</text></h2><h2 title="When to Call the Doctor"><text>If it's been a while since you were active, you should check with your provider before starting any new activity. Also, to make sure you are healthy enough for exercise, check with your provider if you have: </text><detail>High blood pressure</detail><detail>Diabetes</detail><detail>A heart condition</detail><detail>Another health problem </detail></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>Exercise - heart workout; CAD prevention - workout; Cardiovascular disease prevention - workout</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 4/15/2018"><text>Updated by: Linda J.

This includes medicines you bought without a prescription and medicines you do not take every day. Include information on the dose and how often you take your medicines.</text><text>Also tell your providers about any vitamins, supplements, minerals, or natural medicines you are taking.</text><text>Two weeks before surgery, you may need to stop taking medicines that make put you at risk of bleeding during surgery. Medicines includes aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), naproxen (Naprosyn, Aleve), and other drugs.</text><text>Ask your doctor which medicines you should still take on the day of your surgery.</text></h2><h2 title="Manage Your Medical Problems"><text>If you have diabetes, heart disease, or other medical problems, your surgeon will have you see the doctors who treat you for these problems. Your risk for problems after surgery will be lower if your diabetes and other medical conditions are under control before surgery.</text><text>You may not be able to have dental work for 3 months after certain surgeries (joint replacement or heart valve surgery). So be sure to schedule your dental work before your surgery.</text><text>If you smoke, you need to stop. Ask your provider for help. Smoking will slow down your healing after surgery.</text><text>Tell all your providers that you are having surgery.

<item><title>Gestational diabetes - self-care</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000598.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>Gestational diabetes is high blood sugar (glucose) that starts during pregnancy. If you've been diagnosed with gestational diabetes, learn how to manage your blood sugar so that you and your baby stay healthy. </text></h2><h2 title="What is Gestational Diabetes?"><text>Insulin is a hormone produced in an organ called the pancreas. The pancreas is below and behind the stomach. Insulin is needed to move blood sugar into the body's cells. Inside the cells, glucose is stored and later used for energy. Pregnancy hormones can block insulin from doing its job. When this happens, glucose level may increase in a pregnant woman's blood.</text><text>With gestational diabetes:</text><detail>There are no symptoms in many cases.</detail><detail>Mild symptoms may include increased thirst or shakiness. These symptoms are most often not life threatening to the pregnant woman.</detail><detail>A woman may give birth to a large baby. This can increase the chance of problems with the delivery.</detail><detail>A woman has a higher risk for high blood pressure during pregnancy.</detail></h2><h2 title="How is It Managed?"><text>Becoming pregnant when you are at your ideal body weight can help lower your chance of getting gestational diabetes. If you are overweight, try to lose weight before pregnancy.</text><text>If you do develop gestational diabetes:</text><detail>A healthy diet can keep your blood sugar controlled and may keep you from needing medicine. Healthy eating can also keep you from gaining too much weight in your pregnancy. Too much weight gain can increase your risk for gestational diabetes.</detail><detail>Your doctor, nurse, or dietitian will create a diet just for you. Your health care provider may ask you to keep track of what you eat.</detail><detail>Exercise will help keep your blood sugar under control. A low-impact activity such as walking is a safe and effective type of exercise. Try walking 1 to 2 miles (1.6 to 3.2 kilometers) at a time, 3 or more times per week. Swimming or using an elliptical machine work just as well. Ask your provider what type of exercise, and how much, is best for you.</detail><detail>If changing your diet and exercising don't control your blood sugar level, you may need oral medicine (taken by mouth) or insulin therapy (shots). </detail></h2><h2 title="What are the Risks of Gestational Diabetes?"><text>Women who follow their treatment plan and keep their blood sugar normal or close to normal during their pregnancy should have a good outcome. </text><text>Blood sugar that is too high raises the risks for: </text><detail>Stillbirth</detail><detail>Very small baby (fetal growth restriction) or very large baby (macrosomia)</detail><detail>Difficult labor or cesarean birth (C-section)</detail><detail>Problems with blood sugar or electrolytes in the baby during the first few days after delivery </detail></h2><h2 title="Checking Your Blood Sugar"><text>You can see how well you are doing by testing your blood sugar level at home. Your provider may ask you to check your blood sugar several times each day.</text><text>The most common way to check is by pricking your finger and drawing a drop of blood. Then, you place the blood drop in a monitor (testing machine) that measures your blood glucose. If the result is too high or too low, you will need to closely monitor your blood sugar level.</text><text>Your providers will follow your blood sugar level with you. Make sure you know what your blood sugar level should be.</text><text>Managing your blood sugar can seem like a lot of work. But many women are motivated by their desire to make sure both they and their baby have the best possible outcome.</text></h2><h2 title="Visits and Tests for You and Your Baby"><text>Your provider will closely check both you and your baby throughout your pregnancy. This will include:</text><detail>Visits with your provider every week</detail><detail>Ultrasounds that show the size of your baby</detail><detail>A non-stress test that shows whether your baby is doing well </detail><text>If you need insulin or oral medicine to control your blood sugar, you may need to have labor induced 1 or 2 weeks before your due date.</text></h2><h2 title="After Your Delivery"><text>Women with gestational diabetes should be watched closely after giving birth. They should also continue to get checked at future clinic appointments for signs of diabetes.</text><text>High blood sugar levels often go back to normal after delivery. Still, many women with gestational diabetes develop diabetes within 5 to 10 years after giving birth. The risk is greater in obese women. </text></h2><h2 title="When to Call the Doctor"><text>Call your provider for the following diabetes-related problems:</text><detail>Your baby seems to be moving less in your belly</detail><detail>You have blurred vision</detail><detail>You're more thirsty than normal</detail><detail>You have nausea and vomiting that won't go away</detail><text>It's normal to feel stressed or down about being pregnant and having diabetes. But, if these emotions are overwhelming you, call your provider. Your health care team is there to help you.</text></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>Pregnancy - gestational diabetes; Prenatal care - gestational diabetes</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 4/26/2017"><text>Updated by: Irina Burd, MD, PhD, Associate Professor of Gynecology and Obstetrics at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD.

<item><title>Genital herpes - self-care</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000653.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>It is normal to be worried after finding out that you have genital herpes. But know that you are not alone. Millions of people carry the virus. Although there is no cure, genital herpes can be treated. Follow your health care provider's instructions for treatment and follow-up.</text></h2><h2 title="Future Outbreaks"><text>One type of herpes virus stays in the body by hiding within nerve cells. It can remain "asleep" (dormant) for a long time. The virus can "wake up" (reactivate) at any time. This can be triggered by:</text><detail>Fatigue</detail><detail>Genital irritation</detail><detail>Menstruation</detail><detail>Physical or emotional stress</detail><detail>Injury </detail><text>The pattern of outbreaks varies widely in people with herpes. Some people carry the virus even though they've never had symptoms. Others may have only one outbreak or outbreaks that occur rarely. Some people have regular outbreaks that occur every 1 to 4 weeks.</text></h2><h2 title="Self-care"><text>To ease symptoms:</text><detail>Take acetaminophen, ibuprofen, or aspirin to relieve pain.</detail><detail>Apply cool compresses to sores several times a day to relieve pain and itching.</detail><detail>Women with sores on the vaginal lips (labia) can try urinating in a tub of water to avoid pain. </detail><text>Doing the following may help sores heal:</text><detail>Wash sores gently with soap and water. Then pat dry.</detail><detail>DO NOT bandage sores. Air speeds healing.</detail><detail>DO NOT pick at sores. They can get infected, which slows healing.</detail><detail>DO NOT use ointment or lotion on sores unless your provider prescribes it. </detail><text>Wear loose-fitting cotton underwear. DO NOT wear nylon or other synthetic pantyhose or underwear. Also, DO NOT wear tight-fitting pants. </text></h2><h2 title="Medicine"><text>Genital herpes cannot be cured. Antiviral medicine (acyclovir and related drugs) may relieve pain and discomfort and help the outbreak go away faster. It may also reduce the number of outbreaks. Follow your provider's instructions about how to take this medicine if it has been prescribed. There are two ways to take it:</text><detail>One way is to take it for about 7 to 10 days only when symptoms occur. This typically shortens the time it takes for symptoms to clear up.</detail><detail>The other is to take it daily to prevent outbreaks. </detail><text>Generally, there are very few if any side effects from this medicine. If they occur, side effects may include:</text><detail>Fatigue</detail><detail>Headache</detail><detail>Nausea and vomiting</detail><detail>Rash</detail><detail>Seizures</detail><detail>Tremor </detail></h2><h2 title="Reducing Outbreaks"><text>Consider taking anti-viral medicine daily to keep outbreaks from developing. </text><text>Taking steps to keep yourself healthy can also minimize the risk of future outbreaks. Things you can do include:</text><detail>Get plenty of sleep. This helps keep your immune system strong.</detail><detail>Eat healthy foods. Good nutrition also helps your immune system stay strong.</detail><detail>Keep stress low. Constant stress can weaken your immune system.</detail><detail>Protect yourself from the sun, wind, and extreme cold and heat. Use sunscreen, especially on your lips. On windy, cold, or hot days, stay indoors or take steps to guard against the weather. </detail></h2><h2 title="Preventing the Spread of Herpes"><text>Even when you do not have sores, you can pass (shed) the virus to someone during sexual or other close contact. To protect others: </text><detail>Let any sexual partner know that you have herpes before having sex. Allow them to decide what to do.</detail><detail>Use latex or polyurethane condoms, and avoid sex during symptomatic outbreaks.</detail><detail>DO NOT have vaginal, anal, or oral sex when you have sores on or near the genitals, anus, or mouth.</detail><detail>DO NOT kiss or have oral sex when you have a sore on the lips or inside the mouth.</detail><detail>DO NOT share your towels, toothbrush, or lipstick. Make sure dishes and utensils you use are washed well with detergent before others use them.</detail><detail>Wash your hands well with soap and water after touching a sore.</detail><detail>Consider using daily anti-viral medicine to limit viral shedding and reduce the risk of passing the virus to your partner.</detail><detail>You may also want to consider getting your partner tested even if they have never had an outbreak. If you both have the herpes virus, there is no risk of transmission. </detail></h2><h2 title="When to Call the Doctor"><text>Call your health care provider if you have any of the following:</text><detail>Symptoms of an outbreak that worsen despite medicine and self-care</detail><detail>Symptoms that include severe pain and sores that do not heal</detail><detail>Frequent outbreaks</detail><detail>Outbreaks during pregnancy </detail></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>

<item><title>Genetic testing and your cancer risk</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000842.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>The genes in our cells play important roles. They affect hair and eye color and other traits passed on from parent to child. Genes also tell cells to make proteins to help the body function. </text><text>Cancer occurs when cells begin to act abnormally. Changes in genes (mutations) tell the cells to divide rapidly and stay active. This leads to cancer growth and tumors. Gene mutations may be the result of damage to the body or something passed down in the genes in your family.</text><text>Genetic testing can help you find out if you have a genetic mutation that may lead to cancer or that may affect other members in your family. Learn about which cancers have testing available, what the results mean, and other things to consider before you get tested. </text></h2><h2 title="Which Cancers may be Genetic"><text>Today, we know specific gene mutations that can cause over 50 cancers, and the knowledge is growing.</text><text>A single gene mutation may be tied to different types of cancer, not just one.</text><detail>For example, the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes are linked with breast cancer, ovarian cancer, and several other cancers, in men and women. Around one half of women who inherit BRCA1 or BRCA2 will develop breast cancer by age 70 years.</detail><detail>Polyps or growths on the lining of the colon or rectum may be linked to cancer and at times may be part of an inherited disorder.</detail><text>Genetic mutations are linked with the following cancers:</text><detail>Breast (male and female)</detail><detail>Ovarian</detail><detail>Prostate</detail><detail>Pancreatic</detail><detail>Bone</detail><detail>Leukemia</detail><detail>Adrenal gland</detail><detail>Thyroid</detail><detail>Endometrial</detail><detail>Colorectal</detail><detail>Small intestine</detail><detail>Renal pelvis</detail><detail>Liver or biliary tract</detail><detail>Stomach</detail><detail>Brain</detail><detail>Eye</detail><detail>Melanoma</detail><detail>Parathyroid</detail><detail>Pituitary gland</detail><detail>Kidney</detail><text>Signs that cancer may have a genetic cause include:</text><detail>Cancer that is diagnosed at a younger than normal age</detail><detail>Several types of cancers in the same person</detail><detail>Cancer that develops in both paired organs, such as both breasts or kidneys</detail><detail>Several blood relatives who have the same type of cancer</detail><detail>Unusual cases of a specific type of cancer, such as breast cancer in a man</detail><detail>Birth defects that are linked to certain inherited cancers</detail><detail>Being part of a racial group with a high risk of certain cancers along with one or more of the above</detail></h2><h2 title="About Genetic Testing"><text>You may first have an assessment to determine your level of risk. A genetic counselor will order the test after talking with you about your health and needs. Genetic counselors are trained to inform you without trying to guide your decision. That way you can decide whether testing is right for you.</text><text>How testing works:</text><detail>Blood, saliva, skin cells, or amniotic fluid (around a growing fetus) can be used for testing.</detail><detail>Samples are sent to a lab that specializes in genetic testing. It can take several weeks to get the results.</detail><detail>Once you get the results, you will talk with the genetic counselor about what they may mean for you. </detail><text>While you may be able to order testing on your own, it is a good idea to work with a genetic counselor. They can help you understand the benefits and limitations of your results, and possible actions. Also, they can help you understand what it may mean for family members, and counsel them as well.</text><text>You will need to sign an informed consent form before testing.</text></h2><h2 title="What Genetic Testing can Tell you"><text>Testing may be able to tell you if you have a genetic mutation that is linked with a group of cancers. A positive result means you have an increased risk of getting those cancers.</text><text>However, a positive result does not mean you will develop the cancer. Genes are complex. The same gene may affect one person differently from another.</text><text>Of course, a negative result does not mean you will never get cancer. You may not be at risk due to your genes, but you could still develop cancer from a different cause.</text><text>Your results may not be as simple as positive and negative. The test may discover a mutation in a gene that experts have not identified as a cancer risk at this point. You may also have a strong family history of a certain cancer and a negative result for a gene mutation. Your genetic counselor will explain these types of results.</text><text>There also may be other gene mutations not yet identified. You can only be tested for the genetic mutations we know about today. Work continues on making genetic testing more informative and accurate.</text></h2><h2 title="Who Should Consider Testing"><text>Deciding whether to have genetic testing is a personal decision. You may want to consider genetic testing if:</text><detail>You have close relatives (mother, father, sisters, brothers, children) who have had the same type of cancer.</detail><detail>People in your family have had cancer linked to a gene mutation, such as breast or ovarian cancer.</detail><detail>Your family members had cancer at a younger age than normal for that type of cancer.</detail><detail>You have had cancer screening results that may point to genetic causes.</detail><detail>Family members have had genetic tests and had a positive result. </detail><text>Testing can be done in adults, children, and even in a growing fetus and embryo. </text></h2><h2 title="Possible Benefits of Testing"><text>The information you get from a genetic test may help guide your health decisions and lifestyle choices. There are certain benefits of knowing if you carry a gene mutation. You may be able to lower your risk for cancer or prevent it by:</text><detail>Having surgery.</detail><detail>Changing your lifestyle.</detail><detail>Starting cancer screenings. This can help you catch cancer early, when it can be treated more easily.</detail><text>If you already have cancer, testing may help guide targeted treatment.</text></h2><h2 title="Questions to Consider Before Testing"><text>If you are thinking about testing, here are some questions you may want to ask your health care provider or genetic counselor:</text><detail>Is genetic testing right for me?</detail><detail>What testing will be done? How accurate is the testing?</detail><detail>Will the results help me?</detail><detail>How might the answers affect me emotionally?</detail><detail>What is the risk of passing a mutation onto my children?</detail><detail>How will the information affect my relatives and relationships?</detail><detail>Is the information private?</detail><detail>Who will have access to the information?</detail><detail>Who will pay for the testing (which can cost thousands of dollars)?</detail><text>Before getting tested, be sure you understand the process and what the results may mean for you and your family.</text></h2><h2 title="When to Call the Doctor "><text>You should call your provider if you:</text><detail>Are considering genetic testing</detail><detail>Would like to discuss the results of genetic testing</detail></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>Genetic mutations; Inherited mutations; Genetic testing - cancer</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 7/26/2018"><text>Updated by: Todd Gersten, MD, Hematology/Oncology, Florida Cancer Specialists &amp;amp; Research Institute, Wellington, FL.

<item><title>Generalized anxiety disorder - self-care</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000685.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is a mental condition in which you're frequently worried or anxious about many things. Even when there is no clear cause, you're still not able to control your anxiety. </text><text>The right treatment can often improve GAD. You and your health care provider should make a treatment plan that could include talk therapy (psychotherapy), taking medicine, or both.</text></h2><h2 title="Taking Medicine"><text>Your provider may prescribe one or more medicines, including:</text><detail>An antidepressant, which can help with anxiety and depression. This kind of medicine may take weeks to start working. It is a safe medium- to long-term treatment for GAD.</detail><detail>A benzodiazepine, which acts faster than an antidepressant to control anxiety. But it can become less effective over time. Your provider may prescribe a benzodiazepine to help your anxiety while you wait for the antidepressant to work. Also, benzodiazepines may become habit forming over time.</detail><text>When taking medicine for GAD:</text><detail>Keep your provider informed about your symptoms. If a medicine isn't controlling symptoms, its dosage may need to be changed, or you may need to try a new medicine instead.</detail><detail>DO NOT change the dosage or stop taking the medicine without talking to your provider.</detail><detail>Take medicine at set times. For example, take it every day at breakfast. Check with your provider about the best time to take your medicine.</detail><detail>Ask your provider about side effects and what to do if they occur. </detail></h2><h2 title="Therapy"><text>Talk therapy takes place with a trained therapist and in a safe place. It helps you learn ways of managing and reducing your anxiety. Some forms of talk therapy can help you understand what causes your anxiety. This allows you to gain better control over it.</text><text>Many types of talk therapy may be helpful for GAD. One common and effective talk therapy is cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT). CBT can help you understand the relationship between your thoughts, your behaviors, and your symptoms. Often CBT involves a set number of visits. During CBT you can learn how to:</text><detail>Understand and gain control of distorted views of stressors, such as other people's behavior or life events.</detail><detail>Recognize and replace panic-causing thoughts to help you feel more in control.</detail><detail>Manage stress and relax when symptoms occur.</detail><detail>Avoid thinking that minor problems will develop into terrible ones.</detail><text>Your provider can discuss talk therapy options with you. Then you can decide together if it is right for you. </text></h2><h2 title="Other Ways to Manage Your Anxiety"><text>Taking medicine and going to talk therapy can get you started on the road to feeling better. It can also help you take care of your body and relationships. To help improve your condition:</text><detail>Get enough sleep.</detail><detail>Eat healthy foods.</detail><detail>Keep a regular daily schedule.</detail><detail>Get out of the house every day.</detail><detail>Exercise every day. Even a little bit of exercise, such as a 15-minute walk, can help.</detail><detail>Stay away from alcohol and street drugs.</detail><detail>Talk with family or friends when you feel nervous or frightened.</detail><detail>Find out about different types of group activities you can join. </detail></h2><h2 title="When to Call the Doctor"><text>Call your provider if you:</text><detail>Find it hard to control your anxiety</detail><detail>Do not sleep well</detail><detail>Feel sad or feel like you want to hurt yourself</detail><detail>Have physical symptoms from your anxiety </detail></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>GAD - self-care; Anxiety - self-care; Anxiety disorder - self-care</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 5/12/2017"><text>Updated by: Fred K.

Your surgeon used staples to divide your stomach into a small upper section, called a pouch, and a larger bottom section. Then your surgeon sewed a section of your small intestine to a small opening in this small stomach pouch. The food you eat will now go into your small stomach pouch, then into your small intestine.</text><text>You probably spent 1 to 3 days in the hospital. When you go home you will be eating liquids or puréed foods. You should be able to move around without too much problem.</text></h2><h2 title="What to Expect at Home"><text>You will lose weight quickly over the first 3 to 6 months. During this time, you may: </text><detail>Have body aches</detail><detail>Feel tired and cold</detail><detail>Have dry skin</detail><detail>Have mood changes</detail><detail>Have hair loss or hair thinning </detail><text>These problems should go away as your body gets used to your weight loss and your weight becomes stable. Because of this quick weight loss, you will need to be careful that you get all of the nutrition and vitamins you need as you recover. </text><text>Weight loss slows down after 12 to 18 months.</text></h2><h2 title="Diet "><text>You will remain on liquid or puréed food for 2 or 3 weeks after surgery. You will slowly add soft foods and then regular food, as your health care provider told you to do. Remember to eat small portions and chew each bite very slowly and completely.</text><text>DO NOT eat and drink at the same time. Drink fluids at least 30 minutes after you eat food. Drink slowly. Sip when you are drinking. DO NOT gulp. Your provider may tell you not to use a straw, as it may bring air into your stomach.</text><text>Your provider will teach you about foods that you should eat and foods you should stay away from.</text></h2><h2 title="Activity"><text>Being active soon after surgery will help you recover more quickly. During the first week:</text><detail>Start walking after surgery. Move around the house and shower, and use the stairs at home.</detail><detail>If it hurts when you do something, stop doing that activity. </detail><text>If you have laparoscopic surgery, you should be able to do most of your regular activities in 2 to 4 weeks.

It may help. </detail><text>Make sure your home is set up for your recovery, to prevent falls and make sure you are safe in the bathroom.</text><text>If your provider says it is OK, you may start an exercise program 2 to 4 weeks after surgery.</text><text>You DO NOT need to join a gym to exercise. If you have not exercised or been active in a long time, be sure to start off slowly to prevent injuries. Taking a 5- to 10-minute walk every day is a good start. Increase this amount until you are walking 15 minutes twice a day.</text></h2><h2 title="Wound Care"><text>You may change the dressing every day if your provider tells you to do so.

The skin around your incisions may be a little red. This is normal, too.</text><text>DO NOT wear tight clothing that rubs against your incisions while they heal.</text><text>Keep your dressing (bandage) on your wound clean and dry. If there are sutures (stitches) or staples, they will be removed about 7 to 10 days after surgery. Some stitches can dissolve on their own. Your provider will tell you if you have them.</text><text>Unless you are told otherwise, DO NOT shower until after your follow-up appointment with your provider. When you can shower, let water run over your incision, but DO NOT scrub or let the water beat down on it.</text><text>DO NOT soak in a bathtub, swimming pool, or hot tub until your provider says it is OK.</text><text>Press a pillow over your incisions when you need to cough or sneeze.</text></h2><h2 title="Drugs"><text>You may need to take some medicines when you go home.</text><detail>You may need to give yourself shots underneath the skin of a blood-thinning drug for 2 or more weeks.

The urethra is the tube that carries urine from the bladder to outside the body. The type of repair that was done depends on how severe the birth defect was. This may be the first surgery for this problem or it may be a follow-up procedure.</text><text>Your child received general anesthesia before surgery to make him unconscious and unable to feel pain.</text></h2><h2 title="What to Expect at Home"><text>Your child may feel sleepy when first at home. He may not feel like eating or drinking. He may also feel sick to his stomach or throw up the same day he had surgery.</text><text>Your child's penis will be swollen and bruised. This will get better after a few weeks. Full healing will take up to 6 months. </text><text>Your child may need a urinary catheter for 5 to 14 days after the surgery.</text><detail>The catheter may be held in place with small stitches. The health care provider will remove the stitches when your child does not need the catheter anymore.</detail><detail>The catheter will drain into your child's diaper or a bag taped to his leg. Some urine may leak around the catheter when he urinates. There may also be a spot or two of blood. This is normal. </detail><text>If your child has a catheter, he may have bladder spasms. These may hurt, but they are not harmful. If a catheter has not been put in, urinating be uncomfortable the first day or 2 after surgery.</text><text>Your child's provider may write a prescription for some medicines:</text><detail>Antibiotics to prevent infection.</detail><detail>Medicines to relax the bladder and stop bladder spasms.

You can also give your child acetaminophen (Tylenol) for pain. </detail></h2><h2 title="Taking Care of Your Child "><text>Your child may eat a normal diet. Make sure he drinks plenty of fluids. Fluids help keep the urine clean.</text><text>A dressing with a clear plastic covering will be wrapped around the penis. </text><detail>If stool gets on the outside of the dressing, clean it gently with soapy water.

<item><title>Hydramnios</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000599.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>Hydramnios is a condition that occurs when too much amniotic fluid builds up during pregnancy. It is also called amniotic fluid disorder, or polyhydramnios.</text></h2><h2 title="What Causes Hydramnios?"><text>Amniotic fluid is a liquid that surrounds and cushions the fetus (unborn baby) inside the uterus. It comes from the baby's kidneys, and it goes into the uterus from the baby's urine. The fluid is absorbed when the baby swallows it and through breathing motions.</text><text>The amount of fluid increases until the 36th week of pregnancy. After that, it slowly decreases. If the fetus makes too much urine or does not swallow enough, amniotic fluid builds up. This causes hydramnios. </text></h2><h2 title="What Are the Risks of Hydramnios?"><text>Mild hydramnios may not cause any problems. Often, extra fluid that appears during the second trimester returns to normal on its own. Mild hydramnios is more common than severe hydramnios.</text><text>Hydramnios may occur in normal pregnancies with more than one baby (twins, triplets, or more).</text><text>Severe hydramnios may mean there is a problem with the fetus. If you have severe hydramnios, your health care provider will look for these problems:</text><detail>Birth defects of the brain and spinal column</detail><detail>Blockages in the digestive system</detail><detail>A genetic problem (a problem with the chromosomes that is inherited)</detail><text>Many times, the cause of hydramnios is not found. In some cases, it is linked to pregnancy in women who have diabetes or when the fetus is very large.</text></h2><h2 title="How Will I Know if I Have Hydramnios?"><text>Mild hydramnios often has no symptoms. Be sure to tell your provider if you have:</text><detail>A hard time breathing</detail><detail>Belly pain</detail><detail>Swelling or bloating of your belly</detail><text>To check for hydramnios, your provider will measure your "fundal height" during your prenatal check-ups. Fundal height is the distance from your pubic bone to the top of your uterus. Your provider will also check your baby's growth by feeling your uterus through your belly.</text><text>Your provider will do an ultrasound if there is a chance that you may have hydramnios. This will measure the amount of amniotic fluid around your baby. </text></h2><h2 title="How is Hydramnios Treated?"><text>In some cases, the symptoms of hydramnios can be treated but the cause cannot be treated.</text><detail>Your provider may want you to stay in the hospital.</detail><detail>Your provider may also prescribe medicine to prevent a preterm delivery.</detail><detail>They might remove some of the extra amniotic fluid to relieve your symptoms.</detail><detail>Nonstress tests can be done to make sure the fetus is not in danger (Nonstress tests involve listening to the baby's heart rate and monitoring contractions for 20 to 30 minutes.) </detail><text>Your provider may also do tests to find out why you have extra fluid. These might include:</text><detail>Blood tests to check for diabetes or an infection</detail><detail>Amniocentesis (a test that checks amniotic fluid)</detail></h2><h2 title="Hydramnios and Your Delivery"><text>Hydramnios may cause you to go into labor early.</text><text>It is easy for a fetus with a lot of fluid around it to flip and turn. This means there is a greater chance of being in a feet-down position (breech) when it is time to deliver. Breech babies can sometimes be moved into a head-down position, but they often have to be delivered by C-section.</text></h2><h2 title="Can I Prevent Hydramnios?"><text>You cannot prevent hydramnios.

Your skin protects your body from germs. When the skin is broken, even during surgery, germs can enter and cause infection. Wounds often occur because of an accident or injury.</text><text>Types of wounds include:</text><detail>Cuts</detail><detail>Scrapes</detail><detail>Puncture wounds</detail><detail>Burns</detail><detail>Pressure sores </detail><text>A wound may be smooth or jagged. It may be near the surface of the skin or deeper. Deep wounds can affect:</text><detail>Tendons</detail><detail>Muscles</detail><detail>Ligaments</detail><detail>Nerves</detail><detail>Blood vessels</detail><detail>Bones </detail><text>Minor wounds often heal easily, but all wounds need care to prevent infection.</text></h2><h2 title="Stages of Wound Healing"><text>Wounds heal in stages. The smaller the wound, the quicker it will heal. The larger or deeper the wound, the longer it takes to heal. When you get a cut, scrape, or puncture, the wound will bleed.</text><detail>The blood will start to clot within a few minutes or less and stop the bleeding.</detail><detail>The blood clots dry and form a scab, which protects the tissue underneath from germs. </detail><text>Not all wounds bleed. For example, burns, some puncture wounds, and pressure sores do not bleed. </text><text>Once the scab forms, your body's immune system starts to protect the wound from infection.</text><detail>The wound becomes slightly swollen, red or pink, and tender.</detail><detail>You also may see some clear fluid oozing from the wound. This fluid helps clean the area.</detail><detail>Blood vessels open in the area, so blood can bring oxygen and nutrients to the wound. Oxygen is essential for healing.</detail><detail>White blood cells help fight infection from germs and begin to repair the wound.</detail><detail>This stage takes about 2 to 5 days. </detail><text>Tissue growth and rebuilding occur next.</text><detail>Over the next 3 weeks or so, the body repairs broken blood vessels and new tissue grows.</detail><detail>Red blood cells help create collagen, which are tough, white fibers that form the foundation for new tissue.</detail><detail>The wound starts to fill in with new tissue, called granulation tissue.</detail><detail>New skin begins to form over this tissue.</detail><detail>As the wound heals, the edges pull inward and the wound gets smaller. </detail><text>A scar forms and the wound becomes stronger.</text><detail>As healing continues, you may notice that the area itches. After the scab falls off, the area may look stretched, red, and shiny.</detail><detail>The scar that forms will be smaller than the original wound. It will be less strong and less flexible than the surrounding skin.</detail><detail>Over time, the scar will fade and may disappear completely. This can take as long as 2 years. Some scars never go away completely.</detail><detail>Scars form because the new tissue grows back differently than the original tissue. If you only injured the top layer of skin, you will probably not have a scar. With deeper wounds, you are more likely to have a scar. </detail><text>Some people are more likely to scar than others. Some may have thick, unsightly scars called keloids. People with darker complexions are more likely to have keloids form. </text></h2><h2 title="Taking Care of Your Wound"><text>Properly caring for your wound means keeping it clean and covered. This can help prevent infections and scarring.</text><detail>For minor wounds, clean your wound with gentle soap and water. Cover the wound with a sterile bandage or other dressing.</detail><detail>For major wounds, follow your health care provider's instructions on how to care for your injury.</detail><detail>Avoid picking at or scratching the scab. This can interfere with healing and cause scarring.</detail><detail>Once the scar forms, some people think it helps to massage it with vitamin E or petroleum jelly. However, this is not proven to help prevent a scar or help it fade. DO NOT rub your scar or apply anything to it without talking with your provider first. </detail></h2><h2 title="Outlook"><text>When cared for properly, most wounds heal well, leaving only a small scar or none at all. With larger wounds, you are more likely to have a scar.</text><text>Certain factors can prevent wounds from healing or slow the process, such as:</text><detail>Infection can make a wound larger and take longer to heal.</detail><detail>Diabetes. People with diabetes are likely to have wounds that won't heal, which are also called long-term (chronic) wounds.</detail><detail>Poor blood flow due to clogged arteries (arteriosclerosis) or conditions such as varicose veins.</detail><detail>Obesity increases the risk of infection after surgery. Being overweight can also put tension on stitches, which can make them break open.</detail><detail>Age. In general, older adults heal more slowly than younger people.</detail><detail>Heavy alcohol use can slow healing and increase the risk for infection and complications after surgery.</detail><detail>Stress may cause you to not get enough sleep, eat poorly, and smoke or drink more, which can interfere with healing.</detail><detail>Medicines such as corticosteroids, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and some chemotherapy drugs can slow healing.</detail><detail>Smoking can delay healing after surgery. It also increases the risk for complications such as infection and wounds breaking open.</detail><text>Wounds that are slow to heal may need extra care from your provider.</text></h2><h2 title="When to Call the Doctor"><text>Call your provider right away if you have:</text><detail>Redness, increased pain, or yellow or green pus, or excessive clear fluid around the injury. These are signs of infection.</detail><detail>Black edges around the injury. This is a sign of dead tissue.</detail><detail>Bleeding at the injury site that will not stop after 10 minutes of direct pressure.</detail><detail>Fever of 100°F (37.7°C) or higher for more than 4 hours.</detail><detail>Pain at the wound that will not go away, even after taking pain medicine.</detail><detail>A wound that has come open or the stitches or staples have come out too soon. </detail></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>How cuts heal; How scrapes heal; How puncture wounds heal; How burns heal; How pressure sores heal; How lacerations heal</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 6/11/2018"><text>Updated by: Debra G.

<item><title>How to use your peak flow meter</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000043.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>A peak flow meter is a small device that helps you check how well your asthma is controlled. Peak flow meters are most helpful if you have moderate to severe persistent asthma.</text></h2><h2 title="How to Measure Peak Flow"><text>Measuring your peak flow can tell you and your health care provider how well you blow air out of your lungs. If your airways are narrowed and blocked due to asthma, your peak flow values drop.</text><text>You can check your peak flow at home. Here are the basic steps:</text><detail>Move the marker to the bottom of the numbered scale.</detail><detail>Stand up straight.</detail><detail>Take a deep breath. Fill your lungs all the way.</detail><detail>Hold your breath while you place the mouthpiece in your mouth, between your teeth. Close your lips around it. DO NOT put your tongue against or inside the hole.</detail><detail>Blow out as hard and fast as you can in a single blow. Your first burst of air is the most important. So blowing for a longer time will not affect your result.</detail><detail>Write down the number you get. But, if you coughed or did not do the steps right, do not write down the number. Instead, do the steps over again.</detail><detail>Move the marker back to the bottom and repeat all these steps 2 more times. The highest of the 3 numbers is your peak flow number. Write it down in your log chart. </detail><text>Many children under age 5 cannot use a peak flow meter very well. But some are able to. Start using peak flow meters before age 5 to get your child used to them.</text></h2><h2 title="Find Your Personal Best"><text>To find your personal best peak flow number, take your peak flow each day for 2 to 3 weeks. Your asthma should be under control during this time. To find your personal best, take your peak flow as close to the following times of day as you can:</text><detail>Between noon and 2 p.m. each day</detail><detail>Each time after you take your quick-relief medicine to relieve symptoms</detail><detail>Any other time your provider tells you to </detail><text>These times for taking your peak flow are only for finding your personal best.</text><text>Write down the number you get for each peak flow reading. The highest peak flow number you had during the 2 to 3 weeks is your personal best.</text><text>Ask your provider to help you fill out an asthma action plan. This plan should tell you when to call the doctor for help and when to use medicines if your peak flow drops to a certain level.</text><text>Your personal best can change over time. Ask your doctor when you should check for a new personal best.</text></h2><h2 title="Use Your Peak Flow Meter Every Day"><text>Once you know your personal best, make taking your peak flow a habit. Take your peak flow:</text><detail>Every morning when you wake up, before you take medicine. Make this part of your daily morning routine.</detail><detail>When you are having asthma symptoms or an attack.</detail><detail>After you take medicine for an attack. This can tell you how bad your asthma attack is and if your medicine is working.</detail><detail>Any other time your doctor tells you to. </detail><text>Check to see which zone your peak flow number is in. Do what your provider told you to do when you are in that zone. This information should be in your action plan. If you use more than one peak flow meter (such as one at home and another one at school or work), be sure that all of them are the same brand.</text></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>Peak flow meter - how to use; Asthma - peak flow meter; Reactive airway disease - peak flow meter; Bronchial asthma - peak flow meter</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 2/18/2018"><text>Updated by: Laura J.

A spacer device will help. The spacer connects to the mouthpiece. The inhaled medicine goes into the spacer tube first. Then you take 2 deep breaths to get the medicine into your lungs. Using a spacer wastes a lot less medicine than spraying the medicine into your mouth.</text><text>Spacers come in different shapes and sizes.

<item><title>How to use a nebulizer</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000006.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>Because you have asthma, COPD, or another lung disease, your doctor has prescribed medicine that you need to take using a nebulizer. A nebulizer is a small machine that turns liquid medicine into a mist. You sit with the machine and breathe in through a connected mouthpiece. Medicine goes into your lungs as you take slow, deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes. It is easy and pleasant to breathe the medicine into your lungs this way. </text><text>If you have asthma, you may not need to use a nebulizer. You may use an inhaler instead, which is usually just as effective. But a nebulizer can deliver medicine with less effort than an inhaler. You and your doctor can decide if a nebulizer is the best way to get the medicine you need. The choice of device may be based on whether you find a nebulizer easier to use and what type of medicine you take.</text><text>Most nebulizers are small, so they are easy to transport. Also, most nebulizers also work by using air compressors. A different kind, called an ultrasonic nebulizer, uses sound vibrations. This kind of nebulizer is quieter, but costs more.</text><text>Take the time to keep your nebulizer clean so that it continues to work properly.</text><text>Use your nebulizer according to the manufacturer's instructions.</text><text>The basic steps to set up and use your nebulizer are as follows:</text><detail>Wash your hands well.</detail><detail>Connect the hose to an air compressor.</detail><detail>Fill the medicine cup with your prescription. To avoid spills, close the medicine cup tightly and always hold the mouthpiece straight up and down.</detail><detail>Attach the hose and mouthpiece to the medicine cup.</detail><detail>Place the mouthpiece in your mouth. Keep your lips firm around the mouthpiece so that all of the medicine goes into your lungs.</detail><detail>Breathe through your mouth until all the medicine is used. This takes 10 to 15 minutes. If needed, use a nose clip so that you breathe only through your mouth. Small children usually do better if they wear a mask.</detail><detail>Turn off the machine when done.</detail><detail>Wash the medicine cup and mouthpiece with water and air dry until your next treatment. </detail></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>Nebulizer - how to use; Asthma - how to use a nebulizer; COPD - how to use a nebulizer; Wheezing - nebulizer; Reactive airway - nebulizer; COPD - nebulizer; Chronic bronchitis - nebulizer; Emphysema - nebulizer</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 2/18/2018"><text>Updated by: Laura J.

<item><title>How to tell your child that you have cancer</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000934.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>Telling your child about your cancer diagnosis can be difficult. You may want to protect your child. You may worry about how your child will react. But it is important to be honest about what is happening. </text></h2><h2 title="Why Kids Need to Know"><text>Cancer is a hard thing to keep secret. Even very young children can sense when something is not right. When children do not know the truth, they fear the worst. In the face of not knowing, your child may think up a story that could be far worse than what is really going on. For example, your child may blame herself that you are sick. </text><text>You also risk having your child learn from someone else that you have cancer. This may harm your child's sense of trust. And once you start cancer treatment, you may not be able to hide the side effects from your child. </text></h2><h2 title="When to Talk About Your Cancer"><text>Find a quiet time to talk with your child when there are no other distractions. If you have more than one child, you may want to tell each one separately. This will allow you to gauge each child's reaction and answer his or her questions in private.</text><text>When talking about your cancer, start with the facts. These include:</text><detail>The kind of cancer you have.</detail><detail>What part of your body has the cancer.</detail><detail>How your cancer or treatment will affect your family and focus on how it will affect your kids. For example, tell them you may not be able to spend as much time with them as in the past.</detail><detail>Whether a relative or other caregiver will be helping out. </detail><text>When talking to your children about your treatment, it may help to explain:</text><detail>The types of treatment you may have, and that you may have surgery.</detail><detail>About how long you will receive treatment (if known).</detail><detail>That the treatment will help you get better, but may cause difficult side effects while you are having it.</detail><detail>Be sure to prepare children ahead of time for any physical changes, such as hair loss, that you may experience. Explain that you may lose weight, lose your hair, or throw up a lot. Explain that these are side effects that will go away. </detail><text>You can adjust the amount of detail you give based on your child's age. Children age 8 and younger may not understand complex words about your illness or treatment, so it is best to keep it simple. For example, you can tell them that you are sick and you need treatment to help you get better. Children ages 8 and older may understand a bit more. Encourage your child to ask questions and try to answer them as honestly as you can. </text><text>Keep in mind that your children may also hear about cancer from other sources, such as TV, movies, or other kids or adults. It is a good idea to ask what they have heard, so you can make sure they have the right information. </text></h2><h2 title="Common Fears"><text>There are some common fears that many children have when they learn about cancer. Since your child may not tell you about these fears, it is a good idea to bring them up yourself.</text><detail>Your child is to blame. It is common for children to think that something they did caused a parent's cancer. Let your child know that no one in your family did anything to cause the cancer.</detail><detail>Cancer is contagious. Many children worry that cancer can spread like the flu, and other people in your family will catch it. Make sure to let your child know that you cannot "catch" cancer from someone else, and they will not get cancer by touching or kissing you.</detail><detail>Everyone dies from cancer. You can explain that cancer is a serious illness, but modern treatments have helped millions of people survive cancer. If your child knows someone who has died of cancer, let them know that there are many kinds of cancer and everyone's cancer is different. Just because Uncle Mike died of his cancer, it does not mean that you will too. </detail><text>You may need to repeat these points to your child many times during your treatment. </text></h2><h2 title="Ways to Help Your Child Cope"><text>Here are some ways to help your children cope as you go through cancer treatment:</text><detail>Try to stay on a normal schedule. Schedules are comforting to kids. Try to keep the same mealtimes and bedtimes.</detail><detail>Let them know you love and value them. This is especially important if your treatment is keeping you from spending as much time with them as you used to.</detail><detail>Keep up their activities. It is important for your kids to continue with music lessons, sports, and other after-school activities during your illness. Ask friends or family members for help with rides.</detail><detail>Encourage kids to spend time with friends and have fun. This is especially important for teens, who may feel guilty about having fun.</detail><detail>Ask other adults to step in. Have your spouse, parents, or other family or friends spend extra time with your children when you cannot. </detail></h2><h2 title="When to Call the Doctor"><text>Many kids are able to cope with a parent's illness without any major problems. But some kids may need extra support. Let your child's doctor know if your child has any of the following behaviors. </text><detail>Seems sad all the time</detail><detail>Cannot be comforted</detail><detail>Has a change in grades</detail><detail>Is very angry or irritable</detail><detail>Cries a lot</detail><detail>Has trouble concentrating</detail><detail>Has changes in appetite</detail><detail>Has trouble sleeping</detail><detail>Tries to hurt himself or herself</detail><detail>Less interest in usual activities </detail><text>These are signs that your child may need a little more help, such as talking with a counselor or other specialists.</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 1/31/2018"><text>Updated by: Todd Gersten, MD, Hematology/Oncology, Florida Cancer Specialists &amp;amp; Research Institute, Wellington, FL.

The first 3 days will probably be the worst. As more time passes, your cravings should get less intense.</text><text>PLAN AHEAD</text><text>Thinking about how to resist cravings ahead of time can help you overcome them.</text><text>Make a list. Write down the reasons you are quitting. Post the list someplace visible so you can remind yourself of the good things about quitting. Your list might include things like:</text><detail>I will have more energy</detail><detail>I will not wake up coughing</detail><detail>My clothes and breath will smell better</detail><detail>The longer I do not smoke, the less I will crave cigarettes </detail><text>Make rules. You might find yourself thinking you can just smoke 1 cigarette. Any cigarette you smoke will tempt you to smoke more. Rules provide structure to help you keep saying no. Your rules might include:</text><detail>When I have a craving, I will wait at least 10 minutes to see if it passes.</detail><detail>When I have a craving, I will walk up and down the stairs 5 times.</detail><detail>When I have a craving, I will eat a carrot or celery stick. </detail><text>Set up rewards. Plan rewards for each stage of quitting you get through. The longer you go without smoking, the bigger the reward. For instance:</text><detail>After 1 day of not smoking, reward yourself with a new book, DVD, or album.</detail><detail>After 1 week, visit a place you have wanted to go for a long time like a park or museum.</detail><detail>After 2 weeks, treat yourself to a new pair of shoes or tickets to a game. </detail><text>Talk back to yourself. There might be times you think you have to have a cigarette to get through a stressful day. Give yourself a pep talk:</text><detail>Cravings are part of quitting, but I can get through it.</detail><detail>Every day I go without smoking, quitting will get easier.</detail><detail>I have done hard things before, I can do this. </detail><text>AVOID TEMPTATION</text><text>Think about all the situations that make you want to smoke. When possible, avoid these situations. For example, you might need to avoid spending time with friends who smoke, going to bars, or attending parties for a while. Spend time in public places where smoking is not allowed. Try to do things you enjoy like going to a movie, shopping, or hanging out with non-smoking friends. This way you can start to associate not smoking with having fun.</text><text>DISTRACT YOURSELF</text><text>Keep your hands and mouth busy as you get used to not handling cigarettes. You can:</text><detail>Hold a pen, stress ball, or rubber band</detail><detail>Chop vegetables for snacking</detail><detail>Knit or do a jigsaw puzzle</detail><detail>Chew sugar-free gum</detail><detail>Hold a straw or stir stick in your mouth</detail><detail>Eat carrots, celery, or apple slices </detail><text>PRACTICE NEW WAYS TO RELAX</text><text>Many people use smoking to relieve stress. Try new relaxation techniques to help calm yourself:</text><detail>Take a deep breath in through your nose, hold it for 5 seconds, exhale slowly through your mouth. Try this a few times until you feel yourself relax.</detail><detail>Listen to music.</detail><detail>Read a book or listen to an audiobook.</detail><detail>Try yoga, tai chi, or visualization. </detail><text>EXERCISE</text><text>Exercise has many benefits. Moving your body may help reduce cravings. It can also give you a feeling of wellbeing and calm.</text><text>If you only have only a little time, take a short break and walk up and down the stairs, jog in place, or do squats. If you have more time, go to the gym, take a walk, bike ride, or do something else active for 30 minutes or more.</text></h2><h2 title="When to Call the Doctor"><text>If you do not think you can quit on your own, call your health care provider. Nicotine replacement therapy may help you stave off cravings through the first and hardest stage of quitting.</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 8/3/2018"><text>Updated by: Linda J.

<item><title>How to stop smoking: Dealing with a slip up</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000855.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>As you learn how to live without cigarettes, you may slip up after you quit smoking. A slip is different than a total relapse. A slip occurs when you smoke one or more cigarettes, but then go back to not smoking. By acting right away, you can get back on track after a slip.</text></h2><h2 title="Tips if you Slip"><text>These tips can help you stop a slip from becoming a relapse to full-time smoking.</text><text>Stop smoking again right away. If you bought a pack of cigarettes, destroy the rest of the pack. If you bummed a cigarette from a friend, ask that friend not to give you any more cigarettes.</text><text>DO NOT beat yourself up. Many people quit smoking several times before they quit for good. If you get too stressed after a slip, it could make you want to smoke even more.</text><text>Get back to basics. Remind yourself why you want to quit. Post the top 3 reasons by your computer, in your car, on the refrigerator, or someplace else you will see it throughout the day.</text><text>Learn from it. Look at what made you slip, then take steps to avoid that situation in the future. Triggers for a slip can include:</text><detail>Old habits like smoking in the car or after a meal</detail><detail>Being around people who smoke</detail><detail>Drinking alcohol</detail><detail>Smoking first thing in the morning </detail><text>Adopt new habits. Once you figure out what made you slip, plan new ways of resisting the urge to smoke. For instance:</text><detail>Give your car a complete cleaning and make it a smoke-free zone.</detail><detail>Brush your teeth right after every meal.</detail><detail>If your friends light up, excuse yourself so you do not have to watch them smoke.</detail><detail>Limit how much you drink. You might need to avoid alcohol for a while after you quit.</detail><detail>Set a new morning or evening routine that does not include cigarettes. </detail><text>Build coping skills. You might have slipped in response to a stressful day or strong emotions. Develop new ways to deal with stress so you can get through tough times without cigarettes.</text><detail>Learn how to deal with cravings</detail><detail>Read up on stress management and practice the techniques</detail><detail>Join a support group or program to help you quit</detail><detail>Talk to a friend or family member you trust </detail><text>Continue nicotine replacement therapy. You may have heard that you cannot smoke and use nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) at the same time. While this is true, a temporary slip does not mean you have to stop NRT. If you are using nicotine gum or other form of NRT, keep it up. It might help you resist the next cigarette.</text><text>Keep a slip in perspective. If you smoke a cigarette, look at it as a one-time mistake. A slip does not mean you failed. You can still quit for good.</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 8/3/2018"><text>Updated by: Linda J.

<item><title>How to stop drinking</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000857.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>Deciding to quit drinking alcohol is a big step. You may have tried to quit in the past and are ready to try again. You may also be trying for the first time and are not sure where to start.</text><text>While quitting alcohol is not easy, it helps to make a plan to quit and ask for the support of family and friends before you quit. Here are some tips to help get you started.</text></h2><h2 title="Decide How You Will Quit"><text>There are a number of tools and resources to help you quit. You can try one option or combine them. Talk with your health care provider about which options may be best for you.</text><text>Join a support group. Many people have quit alcohol by talking with others who face the same challenges. Some groups have online forums and chats as well as in-person meetings. Try a couple of groups and see what is most comfortable for you.</text><detail>Alcoholics Anonymous -- www.aa.org</detail><detail>Secular Organizations for Sobriety -- www.sossobriety.org</detail><detail>SMART Recovery -- www.smartrecovery.org</detail><text>Work with an addiction counselor. Your provider can help you find a mental health specialist trained in working with people who have problems with alcohol.</text><text>Ask about medicines. Several medicines can help you quit drinking by getting rid of the craving for alcohol and blocking its effects. Ask your provider if one may be a good choice for you.</text><text>Treatment programs. If you have been a heavy drinker for a long time, you may need a more intensive program. Ask your provider to recommend an alcohol treatment program for you. </text><text>If you have withdrawal symptoms, such as trembling hands, when you go without alcohol, you should not try to quit on your own. It may be life threatening. Work with your provider to find a safe way to quit.</text></h2><h2 title="Make a Plan"><text>Take some time to make a plan for quitting. Start by writing down:</text><detail>The date you will stop drinking</detail><detail>Your most important reasons for deciding to quit</detail><detail>The strategies you will use to quit</detail><detail>People who can help you</detail><detail>Roadblocks to staying sober and how you will overcome them </detail><text>Once you have created your plan, keep it somewhere handy, so you can look at it if you need help staying on track. </text></h2><h2 title="Gather Support"><text>Tell trusted family and friends about your decision and ask for their support in helping you stay sober. For example, you can ask them not to offer you alcohol and not to drink around you. You can also ask them to do activities with you that do not involve alcohol. Try to spend the most time with your family and friends who do not drink.</text></h2><h2 title="Know Your Triggers"><text>Triggers are situations, places or people that make you want to have a drink. Make a list of your triggers. Try to avoid the triggers you can, such as going to a bar or hanging out with people who drink. For triggers you cannot avoid, make a plan to deal with them. Some ideas include:</text><detail>Talk to someone. Ask a friend or family member to be on-call when you face a situation that makes you want to drink.</detail><detail>Look at your quit plan. This will help remind you of the reasons you wanted to quit in the first place.</detail><detail>Distract yourself with something else, such as texting a friend, taking a walk, reading, eating a healthy snack, meditating, lifting weights, or doing a hobby.</detail><detail>Accept the urge. This does not mean you should give into the urge. Just understand that it is normal and, most important, it will pass.</detail><detail>If a situation becomes too difficult, leave. DO NOT feel like you have to stick it out to test your willpower. </detail></h2><h2 title="Learn to Say No"><text>At some point you will be offered a drink. It is a good idea to plan ahead for how you will deal with this. Here are some tips that can help:</text><detail>Make eye contact with the person and say "No, thanks" or another short, direct response.</detail><detail>DO NOT hesitate or give a long-winded answer.</detail><detail>Ask a friend to role-play with you, so you are prepared.</detail><detail>Ask for a non-alcoholic drink instead. </detail></h2><h2 title="Do Not Give Up"><text>Changing habits takes hard work. You may not succeed the first time you try to quit. If you slip up and drink, DO NOT give up. Learn from each attempt and try again. Think of a setback as just a bump in the road to recovery.</text></h2><h2 title="When to Call the Doctor"><text>Call your provider if you:</text><detail>Feel depressed or anxious for more than a short time</detail><detail>Have thoughts of suicide</detail><detail>Have severe withdrawal symptoms, such as severe vomiting, hallucinations, confusion, fever, or convulsions</detail></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>Alcohol abuse - how to stop; Alcohol use - how to stop; Alcoholism - how to stop</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 8/22/2016"><text>Updated by: Laura J.

<item><title>How to save money on medicines</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000863.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>Out-of-pocket costs for prescription medicines can really add up. The good news is that there may be ways to save on drug costs. Start by switching to generic options or signing up for a discount program. Here are some other safe ways to save on medicines.</text></h2><h2 title="Switch to Generics"><text>Generic drugs are copies of brand name drugs. They have the same exact medicine as a brand name drug. A generic is approved as safe and effective by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The brand name drug costs more because of the research that went into making it. The generic drug is the same drug, and it costs less money.</text><text>You might also be able to buy a "therapeutic equivalent" at a lower cost. This is a different drug formula, but it treats the same condition. It may work just as well.</text><text>Ask your health care provider if there is a generic option or a similar, less expensive, medicine for the drug you are taking.</text></h2><h2 title="Splitting Pills"><text>You may be able to order a double dose of your medicine, and split the pills in half. It depends on the type of medicine and the dose you are taking. In some cases, it can save you money.</text><text>The FDA has a list of drugs that can be split safely. If the pill is approved for splitting, there will be a note in the "How Supplied" section of the medicine label. There will also be a line across the pill to show you where to split it. You should only split 1 pill at a time and use up both halves before splitting another pill.</text><text>DO NOT split pills without talking with your provider first. Some drugs may be harmful if split before use.</text></h2><h2 title="Mail Order or Online Pharmacies"><text>Try to find a good mail-order pharmacy for your long-term medicines. Your health plan may offer one to you. You can order a 90-day supply and may have a lower copay. </text><text>Also, you can search online for good mail-order prices. Then check with your health plan to make sure the medicines you buy from the program will be covered before you order. </text><text>Remember, not everything on the internet is safe. Check with your health plan or provider before you buy to make sure the program is safe.</text></h2><h2 title="Discount Programs or Supplemental Coverage"><text>You may be eligible for a drug assistance program. It depends on your income and health needs. Some pharmaceutical companies offer these programs. They are also called "patient assistance programs." You may get a discount card, free, or low-cost medicines. You can apply directly to the drug company for the medicine you are taking.</text><text>Websites such as NeedyMeds (www.needymeds.org) and Partnership for Prescription Assistance (www.pparx.org) can help you find assistance for the medicines you are taking.</text><text>Some states and health insurance plans also offer assistance programs. Check with your health plan and local government websites.</text><text>If you are over 65, look into supplemental drug coverage (Medicare Part D). This optional insurance coverage can help you pay for your medicines.</text></h2><h2 title="Use Medicines Wisely"><text>Take all of your medicines as directed to avoid problems that can lead to illness and out-of-pocket expense. Tell your provider if you are taking other medicines, herbal supplements, or over-the-counter drugs.</text><text>Build a good relationship with your pharmacist. Your pharmacist can look out for you, recommend ways to save money, and make sure all the drugs you take are safe.</text><text>Manage your condition. One of the best ways to save money on health care costs is to stay healthy.</text><text>Check with your provider at each visit to make sure you need to continue taking medicines. There may be other ways to manage your condition that cost less.</text></h2><h2 title="Use Caution"><text>Only purchase medicines from a licensed US pharmacy. DO NOT buy medicines from foreign countries to save money. The quality and safety of these medicines is not known.</text></h2><h2 title="When to Call the Health Care Provider"><text>Talk with your provider if:</text><detail>You are having trouble paying for your medicines</detail><detail>You have questions or concerns about your medicines</detail></h2><h2 title="Review Date 8/4/2018"><text>Updated by: Linda J.

<item><title>How to save money on infant formula</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000805.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>The least expensive way to feed your baby is to breastfeed. There are many other breastfeeding benefits, too. But not all moms can breastfeed. Some moms feed their baby both breast milk and formula. Others switch to formula after breastfeeding for several months. Here are some ways you can save money on infant formula. </text></h2><h2 title="Money-Saving Ideas"><text>Here are a few ways to save money on infant formula:</text><detail>DO NOT buy just one type of baby bottle at first. Try a few different types to see which kind your baby likes and will use.</detail><detail>Buy powdered formula. It is much less expensive than ready-to-use and liquid concentrate.</detail><detail>Use cow's milk formula, unless your pediatrician says you shouldn't. Cow's milk formula is often less expensive than soy formula.</detail><detail>Buy in bulk, you will save money. But first try the brand to make sure your baby likes it and can digest it.</detail><detail>Comparison shop. Check to see which store is offering a deal or the lowest price.</detail><detail>Save formula coupons and free samples, even if you plan to breastfeed. You may decide to supplement with formula a few months from now, and those coupons will save you money.</detail><detail>Sign up for newsletters, special programs, and deals on formula company websites. They often send out coupons and free samples.</detail><detail>Ask your pediatrician for samples.</detail><detail>Consider generic or store-brand formulas. By law, they must meet the same nutritional and quality standards as brand-name formulas.</detail><detail>Avoid using disposable bottles. You will have to use a different liner with each feeding, which costs more.</detail><detail>If your baby needs special formula because of allergies or other health issues, see if your insurance will help cover the cost. Not all health plans offer this coverage, but some do. </detail></h2><h2 title="What NOT to Do"><text>Here are a few things to avoid:</text><detail>DO NOT make your own formula. There is no way to duplicate the same nutrition and quality at home. You could risk your baby's health.</detail><detail>DO NOT feed your baby straight cow's milk or other animal milk before they are at least 1 year old.</detail><detail>DO NOT reuse old plastic baby bottles. Reused or hand-me-down bottles may contain bisphenol-A (BPA). The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has banned the use of BPA in baby bottles due to safety concerns.</detail></h2><h2 title="Review Date 5/14/2017"><text>Updated by: Neil K.

That way, you can make well-informed choices about your cancer care.</text></h2><h2 title="Start With Your Cancer Care Team"><text>Start by talking with your cancer care team. Each cancer is different and each person is different. Your providers know you, so the type of care you receive will be based on what is best for you and your situation.</text><text>Talk about your options with your team. You can find information on the website of your cancer center or hospital. Many hospital web sites have a variety of resources:</text><detail>Health libraries</detail><detail>Print and online newsletters and magazines</detail><detail>Blogs</detail><detail>Classes and seminars focused on issues related to having cancer</detail><detail>Information about clinical trials going on at your cancer center or hospital </detail><text>You should also talk with other cancer care providers. It is a good idea to get input from more than one doctor when faced with serious illness. Talk with your provider about getting a second opinion before making major health decisions.</text></h2><h2 title="Explore Trusted Institutions"><text>For more in-depth information, look to government sources and medical associations. They provide research-based, up-to-date information about all types of cancer. Here are several to start with:</text><text>National Cancer Institute -- www.cancer.gov. The National Cancer Institute (NCI) is part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). The NCI has several functions:</text><detail>Supports and conducts cancer research</detail><detail>Collects, analyzes, and shares the results of cancer research</detail><detail>Provides training in cancer diagnosis and treatment </detail><text>You can find current, in-depth information on:</text><detail>All types of cancer</detail><detail>Risk factors and prevention</detail><detail>Diagnosis and treatment</detail><detail>Clinical trials</detail><detail>Support, coping, and resources </detail><text>The NCI creates PDQ (trademark) cancer information summaries. These are comprehensive, evidence-based summaries on topics that cover cancer treatment, supportive and palliative care, screening, prevention, genetics, and integrated medicine.</text><detail>For cancer information summaries on adult cancer treatment -- www.cancer.gov/publications/pdq/information-summaries/adult-treatment</detail><detail>For cancer information summaries on pediatric cancer treatment -- www.cancer.gov/publications/pdq/information-summaries/pediatric-treatment</detail><text>American Cancer Society -- www.cancer.org.

Cancer.net is run by the American Society of Clinical Oncology, a professional organization of clinical oncologists (cancer doctors). The site offers information on:</text><detail>Different types of cancer</detail><detail>How to manage cancer care</detail><detail>Coping and support</detail><detail>Cancer research and advocacy </detail><text>Clinical Trials.gov. The NIH runs this service. The site provides information on clinical trials across the U.S. You can find out:</text><detail>What a clinical trial is</detail><detail>How to find clinical trials in your area, listed by topic or map</detail><detail>How to search for studies and use search results</detail><detail>How to find study results </detail><text>National Comprehensive Cancer Network Patient and Caregiver Resources -- www.nccn.org/patients/about/default.aspx.

You should use some resources with care. </text><text>Online forums, chat rooms, and support groups. These sources can help you find ways to cope, share your stories, and get support. But remember that no two people are alike when it comes to cancer. Be careful not to draw conclusions about your cancer and how it will progress based on what happened to someone else. You should also never get medical advice from online sources.</text><text>Cancer studies. It can be interesting to read the latest study about a new cancer drug or treatment. Just do not read too much into a single study. New ways to diagnose, treat, and prevent cancer are only adopted after many years of research. </text><text>Integrative medicine (IM). Many people with cancer look for alternative therapies. Use care when reading about these remedies. Avoid sites that promise miracle cures. You can find trusted information at the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH). The center is run by the NIH. It offers research-based information on at nccih.nih.gov.</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 1/31/2018"><text>Updated by: Todd Gersten, MD, Hematology/Oncology, Florida Cancer Specialists &amp;amp; Research Institute, Wellington, FL.

<item><title>How to read food labels</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000107.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>Food labels give you information about the calories, number of servings, and nutrient content of packaged foods. Reading the labels can help you make healthy choices when you shop.</text></h2><h2 title="About Food Labels"><text>Food labels tell you the nutrition facts about the foods you buy. Use the food labels to help you choose healthier foods.</text></h2><h2 title="What to Look For"><text>Always check the serving size first. All the information on the label is based on the serving size. Many packages contain more than 1 serving.</text><text>For example, the serving size for spaghetti is most often 2 ounces (56 grams) uncooked, or 1 cup (0.24 liters) cooked. If you eat 2 cups (0.48 liters) at a meal, you are eating 2 servings. That is 2 times the amount of the calories, fats, and other items listed on the label.</text><text>Calorie information tells you the number of calories in 1 serving. Adjust the number of calories if you eat smaller or larger portions. This number helps determine how foods affect your weight.</text><text>The total carbs (carbohydrates) are listed in bold letters to stand out and are measured in grams (g). Sugar, starch, and dietary fiber make up the total carbs on the label. Sugar is listed separately. All of these carbs raise your blood sugar.</text><text>If you have diabetes and count carbs, use the total carb number.</text><text>Dietary fiber is listed just below total carbs. Buy foods with at least 3 to 4 grams of fiber per serving. Whole-grain breads, fruits and vegetables, and beans and legumes are high in fiber.</text><picname>Food Label Guide for Whole Wheat Bread</picname><picurl>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/images/ency/fullsize/19343.jpg</picurl><text>Check the total fat in 1 serving. Pay special attention to the amount of saturated fat in 1 serving.</text><text>Choose foods that are low in saturated fat. For example, drink skim or 1% milk instead of 2% or whole milk. Skim milk has only a trace of saturated fat. Whole milk has 5 grams of this fat per serving.</text><text>Fish is much lower in saturated fat than beef. Three ounces (84 grams) of fish has less than 1 gram of this fat. Three ounces (84 grams) of hamburger has more than 5 grams.</text><text>If a food has less than 0.5 grams of saturated fat in the serving size on the label, the food maker can say it contains no saturated fat. Remember this if you eat more than 1 serving.</text><text>You should also pay attention to trans fats on any food label. These fats raise "bad" cholesterol and lower your "good" cholesterol.</text><text>These fats are mostly found in snack foods and desserts. Many fast food restaurants use trans fats for frying.</text><text>If a food has these fats, the amount will be listed on the label under total fat. They are measured in grams. Look for foods that have no trans fats or are low in them (1 gram or less).</text><picname>Food Label Guide for Candy</picname><picurl>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/images/ency/fullsize/19342.jpg</picurl><text>Sodium is the main ingredient of salt. This number is important for people who are trying to get less salt in their diet. If a label says that a food has 100 mg of sodium, this means it has about 250 mg of salt. You should eat no more than 2,300 mg of sodium per day. Ask your health care provider if you should have even less.</text><text>The % daily value is included on the label as a guide.</text><text>The percentage for each item on the label is based on eating 2,000 calories a day. Your goals will be different if you eat more or fewer calories a day. A dietitian or your provider can help you set your own nutrition goals.</text></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>Nutrition - reading food labels; Diabetes - reading food labels; Hypertension - reading food labels; Fats - reading food labels; Cholesterol - reading food labels; Weight loss - reading food labels; Obesity - reading food labels</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 8/22/2016"><text>Updated by: Laura J.

Being active in the cold can put you at risk for problems such as hypothermia and frostbite.</text></h2><h2 title="How Cold Affects you"><text>Cold temperatures, wind, rain, and even sweat cool your skin and pull heat away from your body. You also lose heat when you breathe and sit or stand on the cold ground or other cold surfaces.</text><text>In cold weather, your body tries to keep a warm inner (core) temperature to protect your vital organs. It does this by slowing blood circulation in your face, arms, hands, legs, and feet. The skin and tissues in these areas becomes colder. This puts you at risk for frostbite. </text><text>If your core body temperature drops just a few degrees, hypothermia will set in. With even mild hypothermia, your brain and body DO NOT work as well. Severe hypothermia can lead to death.</text><text>Dress in Layers</text><text>They key to staying safe in the cold is to wear several layers of clothing. Wearing the right shoes and clothes helps:</text><detail>Keep your body heat trapped inside your clothes</detail><detail>Protect you from cold air, wind, snow, or rain</detail><detail>Protect you from contact with cold surfaces </detail><text>You may need several layers of clothing in cold weather:</text><detail>An inner layer that wicks sweat away from the skin. It can be lightweight wool, polyester, or polypropylene (polypro). Never wear cotton in cold weather, including your underwear. Cotton absorbs moisture and keeps it next to your skin, making you cold.</detail><detail>Middle layers that insulate and keep heat in. They can be polyester fleece, wool, microfiber insulation, or down. Depending on your activity, you may need a couple of insulating layers.</detail><detail>An outer layer that repels wind, snow, and rain. Try to choose a fabric that is both breathable and rain and wind proof. If your outer layer is not also breathable, sweat can build up and make you cold. </detail><text>You also need to protect your hands, feet, neck, and face. Depending on your activity, you may need the following:</text><detail>Warm hat</detail><detail>Face mask</detail><detail>Scarf or neck warmer</detail><detail>Mittens or gloves (mittens tend to be warmer)</detail><detail>Wool or polypro socks</detail><detail>Warm, waterproof shoes or boots </detail><text>The key with all of your layers is to take them off as you warm up and add them back as you cool down. If you wear too much while exercising, you will sweat a lot, which can make you colder.</text></h2><h2 title="Get Plenty of Food and Fluids"><text>You need both food and fluids to fuel your body and keep you warm. If you skimp on either, you increase your risk for cold weather injuries such as hypothermia and frostbite.</text><text>Eating foods with carbohydrates gives you quick energy. If you are only out for a short time, you may want to carry a snack bar to keep your energy going. If you are out all day skiing, hiking, or working, be sure to bring food with protein and fat as well to fuel you over many hours. </text><text>Drink plenty of fluids before and during activities in the cold. You may not feel as thirsty in cold weather, but you still lose fluids through your sweat and when you breathe.</text></h2><h2 title="Watch for Early Signs of Frostbite and Hypothermia"><text>Be aware of the early signs of cold weather injuries. Frostbite and hypothermia can occur at the same time. </text><text>The early stage of frostbite is called frostnip. Signs include:</text><detail>Red and cold skin; skin may start to turn white but is still soft.</detail><detail>Prickling and numbness</detail><detail>Tingling</detail><detail>Stinging </detail><text>Early warning signs of hypothermia include:</text><detail>Feeling cold.</detail><detail>Shivering.</detail><detail>The "Umbles:" stumbles, bumbles, grumbles, and mumbles. These are signs that cold is affecting your body and brain. </detail><text>To prevent more serious problems, take action as soon as you notice early signs of frostbite or hypothermia.</text><detail>Get out of the cold, wind, rain, or snow if possible.</detail><detail>Add warm layers of clothing.</detail><detail>Eat carbohydrates.</detail><detail>Drink fluids.</detail><detail>Move your body to help warm your core. Do jumping jacks or flap your arms.</detail><detail>Warm up any area with frostnip. Remove tight jewelry or clothing. Place cold fingers in your armpits or warm a cold nose or cheek with the palm of your warm hand. DO NOT rub. </detail></h2><h2 title="When to Call the Doctor"><text>You should call your health care provider or get medical help right away if you or someone in your party:</text><detail>Does not get better or gets worse after attempting to warm up or to rewarm frostnip.</detail><detail>Has frostbite. NEVER rewarm frostbite on your own. It can be very painful and damaging.</detail><detail>Shows signs of hypothermia.</detail></h2><h2 title="Review Date 8/3/2018"><text>Updated by: Linda J.

<item><title>How to give a heparin shot</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000661.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>Your doctor prescribed a medicine called heparin. It has to be given as a shot at home.</text><text>A nurse or other health professional will teach you how to prepare the medicine and give the shot. The provider will watch you practice and answer your questions. You may take notes to remember the details. Keep this sheet as a reminder of what you need to do.</text></h2><h2 title="Getting Ready"><text>To get prepared:</text><detail>Gather your supplies: heparin, needles, syringes, alcohol wipes, medicine record, and container for used needles and syringes.</detail><detail>If you have a pre-filled syringe, make sure you have the right medicine at the right dose. DO NOT remove the air bubbles unless you have too much medicine in the syringe. Skip the section on "Filling the Syringe" and go to "Giving the Shot."</detail></h2><h2 title="Filling the Syringe"><text>Follow these steps to fill the syringe with heparin:</text><detail>Wash your hands with soap and water, and dry them well.</detail><detail>Check the heparin bottle label. Make sure it is the right medicine and that it has not expired.</detail><detail>If it has a plastic cover, take it off. Roll the bottle between your hands to mix it. DO NOT shake it.</detail><detail>Wipe the top of the bottle with an alcohol wipe. Let it dry. DO NOT blow on it.</detail><detail>Know the dose of heparin you want. Take the cap off the needle, being careful not to touch the needle to keep it sterile. Pull back the plunger of the syringe to put as much air in the syringe as the dose of medicine you want.</detail><detail>Put the needle into and through the rubber top of the heparin bottle. Push the plunger so the air goes into the bottle.</detail><detail>Keep the needle in the bottle and turn the bottle upside down.</detail><detail>With the tip of the needle in the liquid, pull back on the plunger to get the right dose of heparin into the syringe.</detail><detail>Check the syringe for air bubbles. If there are bubbles, hold both the bottle and syringe in one hand, and tap the syringe with your other hand. The bubbles will float to the top. Push the bubbles back into the heparin bottle, then pull back to get the right dose.</detail><detail>When there are no bubbles, take the syringe out of the bottle. Put the syringe down carefully so the needle does not touch anything. If you are not going to give the shot right away, carefully put the cover over the needle.</detail><detail>If the needle bends, DO NOT straighten it. Get a new syringe. </detail></h2><h2 title="Giving the Shot"><text>Wash your hands with soap and water. Dry them well.</text><text>Choose where to give the shot. Keep a chart of places you have used, so you DO NOT put the heparin in the same place all the time. Ask your provider for a chart. </text><detail>Keep your shots 1 inch (2.5 centimeters) away from scars and 2 inches (5 centimeters) away from your navel.</detail><detail>DO NOT put a shot in a spot that is bruised, swollen, or tender. </detail><text>The site you choose for the injection should be clean and dry. If your skin is visibly dirty, clean it with soap and water. Or use an alcohol wipe. Allow the skin to dry before giving the shot.</text><text>The heparin needs to go into the fat layer under the skin.</text><detail>Pinch the skin and put the needle in at a 45º angle.</detail><detail>Push the needle all the way into the skin. Let go of the pinched skin. Inject the heparin slowly and steadily until it is all in. </detail><text>After all the medicine is in, leave the needle in for 5 seconds. Pull the needle out at the same angle it went in. Put the syringe down and press the shot site with a piece of gauze for a few seconds. DO NOT rub. If it bleeds or oozes, hold it longer.</text><text>Throw away the needle and syringe in a safe hard container (sharps container). Close the container, and keep it safely away from children and animals. Never reuse needles or syringes.</text><text>Write down the date, time, and place on the body where you put the injection. </text></h2><h2 title="Storing Your Heparin and Supplies"><text>Ask your pharmacist how to store your heparin so it stays potent. </text></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>DVT - heparin shot; Deep venous thrombosis - heparin shot; PE - heparin shot; Pulmonary embolism - heparin shot; Blood thinner - heparin shot; Anticoagulant - heparin shot</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 8/22/2016"><text>Updated by: Laura J.

<item><title>How to choose a nursing home</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000956.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>At a nursing home, skilled staff and health care providers offer around-the-clock care. Nursing homes can provide a number of different services:</text><detail>Routine medical care</detail><detail>24-hour supervision</detail><detail>Nursing care</detail><detail>Doctor visits</detail><detail>Help with everyday activities, such as bathing and grooming</detail><detail>Physical, occupational, and speech therapy</detail><detail>All meals </detail><text>Nursing homes provide both short-term and long-term care, depending on the needs of the resident.</text><detail>You may need short-term care during recovery from a serious illness or injury following a hospitalization. Once you recover, you can go home.</detail><detail>You may need long-term daily care if you have an ongoing mental or physical condition and can no longer care for yourself. </detail><text>The type of care you need will be a factor in what facility you choose, as well as how you pay for that care. </text><text>THINGS TO CONSIDER WHEN CHOOSING A FACILITY</text><text>When you start looking for a nursing home:</text><detail>Work with your social worker or discharge planner from the hospital and ask about the kind of care needed. Ask what facilities they recommend.</detail><detail>You can also ask your health care providers, friends, and family, for recommendations.</detail><detail>Make a list of all the nursing homes in or near your area that meet your or your loved one's needs. </detail><text>It's important to do a bit of homework - not all facilities provide the same quality care. Start by looking up facilities on Medicare.gov Nursing Home Compare -- www.medicare.gov/nursinghomecompare/search.html. This allows you to see and compare Medicare- and Medicaid-certified nursing homes based on certain quality measures:</text><detail>Health inspections</detail><detail>Fire safety inspections</detail><detail>Staffing</detail><detail>Quality of care</detail><detail>Penalties (if any) </detail><text>If you can't find a nursing home listed in the website, check to see if it is Medicare/Medicaid certified. Facilities with this certification must meet certain quality standards. If a facility is not certified, you should probably take it off your list. </text><text>Once you've chosen a few facilities to check out, call each facility and check:</text><detail>If they are taking new patients. Can you get a single room, or will you need to share a room? Single rooms may cost more.</detail><detail>The level of care offered. If needed, ask if they offer specialized care, such as stroke rehabilitation or care for dementia patients.</detail><detail>Whether they accept Medicare and Medicaid. </detail><text>Once you have a list of facilities that meet your needs, call and make an appointment to visit each one or ask someone you trust to make the visits. Here are some things to consider during your visit.</text><detail>If possible, the nursing home should be close by so that family members can visit regularly. It's also easier to keep an eye on the level of care being given.</detail><detail>What is the security like for the building? Ask about visiting hours and any restrictions on visits.</detail><detail>Talk with the staff and observe how they treat residents. Are the interactions friendly, polite, and respectful? Do they call residents by their name?</detail><detail>Is there a licensed nursing staff available 24-hours a day? Is a registered nurse available at least 8 hours every day? What happens if a doctor is needed?</detail><detail>If there is someone on staff to help with social service needs?</detail><detail>Do the residents appear clean, well-groomed, and comfortably dressed?</detail><detail>Is the environment well-lit, clean, attractive, and at a comfortable temperature? Are there strong unpleasant smells? Is it very noisy in the dining and common areas?</detail><detail>Ask about how staff members are hired - are there background checks? Are staff members assigned to specific residents? What is the ratio of staff to residents?</detail><detail>Ask about the food and meal schedule. Are there choices for meals? Can they accommodate special diets? Ask if the staff helps residents with eating if needed. Do they make sure the residents are drinking enough fluids? How is this measured?</detail><detail>What are the rooms like? Can a resident bring in personal belongings or furniture? How secure are personal belongings?</detail><detail>Are there activities available for residents? </detail><text>Medicare.gov offers a helpful Nursing Home Checklist you may want to take with you as you check out different facilities: www.medicare.gov/NursingHomeCompare/checklist.pdf.</text><text>Try to visit again at a different time of day and week. This can help you get a fuller picture of each facility.</text><text>PAYING FOR NURSING HOME CARE</text><text>Nursing home care is expensive, and most health insurance won't cover the cost. Often people cover the cost using a combination of self-payment, Medicare, and Medicaid. </text><detail>If you have Medicare, it may pay for short-term care in a nursing home after a 3-day hospitalization. It does not cover long-term care.</detail><detail>Medicaid does pay for nursing home care, and most people in nursing homes are on Medicaid. However, you have to be eligible based on your income. Often people start by paying out of pocket. Once they spend down their savings they can apply for Medicaid - even if they've never been on it before. However, spouses are protected against losing their home to pay for a partner's nursing home care.</detail><detail>Long-term care insurance, if you have it, may pay for short- or long-term care. There are many different types of long-term insurance; some only pay for nursing home care, others pay for a range of services. You may not be able to get this type of insurance if you have a pre-existing condition. </detail><text>It's a good idea to get legal advice when considering how to pay for nursing care - especially before spending all of your savings. Your local Area Agency on Aging may be able to direct you to legal resources. You can also visit LongTermCare.gov for more information.</text></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>Skilled nursing facility - nursing home; Long-term care - nursing home; Short-term care - nursing home</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 5/12/2018"><text>Updated by: Laura J.

<item><title>How to choose a health plan</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000861.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>When it comes to getting health insurance, you may have more than one option. Many employers offer more than one plan. If you are buying from the Health Insurance Marketplace, you may have several plans to choose from. How do you know what to choose? Most health plans have similar features. </text><text>This guide can help you understand how to compare your options, so you get the services you need for a price that fits your budget.</text></h2><h2 title="Key Features to Compare"><text>While most plans have many of the same features, there are differences you should be aware of.</text><text>Premiums. This is the amount you pay for health insurance. You might pay it monthly, quarterly, or once a year. You have to pay it no matter what services you use. Your employer will collect your premiums from your paycheck. You might pay them directly yourself.</text><text>Out-of-pocket costs. These include copayments (copays), deductibles, and co-insurance. These are costs you pay out-of-pocket for certain services. Your health plan pays the rest. You may have to pay a certain amount out of pocket before your health plan will start to pay for the cost of your care.</text><text>Benefits. These are the health services covered by the plan. Thanks to health care reform, most plans must now cover the same basic services. This includes preventive care, hospital care, maternity care, mental health care, lab tests, and prescription drugs. Some services like chiropractic, dental, or vision care may not be fully covered. Also, some plans cover only certain prescription drugs, or charge different copays.</text><text>Provider network. Many plans have a provider network. These providers have contracts with the plan. They provide services for a set price. Your out-of-pocket costs are lower when you use network providers.</text><text>Freedom of choice. Some plans give you the freedom to make appointments with other providers. With other plans, you need to get a referral from your primary care doctor to see a specialist. Many plans also give you the choice to use out-of-network providers, but at a higher cost. Keep in mind that premiums and out-of-pocket costs also may be higher in plans that allow you to see out-of-network providers.</text><text>Paperwork. For some plans, you may need to file claims. If you have a medical savings account for out-of-pocket costs, you may need to keep track of your balance. You also may need to do some paperwork for tax purposes.</text></h2><h2 title="How to Compare Health Plans"><text>Employers and government sites, such as the Marketplace, provide information for each plan. You may be given a booklet that compares all of your choices. You may also be able to compare plans online. When reviewing each plan:</text><detail>Add up the cost of premiums for the year.</detail><detail>Think about how many services you and your family may use in a year. Add up what your out-of-pocket costs may be for each service. Check the maximum amount you have to pay for each plan. You may never reach the maximum if you use fewer services.</detail><detail>Check if your providers and hospitals are in the plan network. If not, see how much more you need to pay to see an out-of-network provider. Also find out if you need referrals.</detail><detail>Check to see if you will be covered for special services you might need, such as dental or vision care. Make sure any prescription drugs are covered by your plan.</detail><detail>Add your premium, your out-of-pocket costs, cost for prescriptions, and any extra costs to get a total for the year.</detail><detail>See how much paperwork and self-management comes with your plan. Think about how much time and interest you have in managing these tasks.</detail><detail>Find out if there are special discounts to your local gym or weight loss program, or other health programs that you might like to use.</detail><text>Taking the time to go over your options and compare costs are well worth it to make sure you get a health plan that suits your needs and your wallet.</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 8/3/2018"><text>Updated by: Linda J.

<item><title>How to care for pressure sores</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000740.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>A pressure sore is an area of the skin that breaks down when something keeps rubbing or pressing against the skin.</text></h2><h2 title="Causes"><text>Pressure sores occur when there is too much pressure on the skin for too long. This reduces blood flow to the area. Without enough blood, the skin can die and a sore may form.</text><text>You are more likely to get a pressure sore if you:</text><detail>Use a wheelchair or stay in bed for a long time</detail><detail>Are an older adult</detail><detail>Cannot move certain parts of your body without help</detail><detail>Have a disease that affects blood flow, including diabetes or vascular disease</detail><detail>Have Alzheimer disease or another condition that affects your mental state</detail><detail>Have fragile skin</detail><detail>Cannot control your bladder or bowels</detail><detail>Do not get enough nutrition </detail></h2><h2 title="Symptoms"><text>Pressure sores are grouped by the severity of symptoms. Stage I is the mildest stage. Stage IV is the worst.</text><detail>Stage I: A reddened, painful area on the skin that does not turn white when pressed. This is a sign that a pressure ulcer is forming. The skin may be warm or cool, firm or soft.</detail><detail>Stage II: The skin blisters or forms an open sore. The area around the sore may be red and irritated.</detail><detail>Stage III: The skin now develops an open, sunken hole called a crater. The tissue below the skin is damaged. You may be able to see body fat in the crater.</detail><detail>Stage IV: The pressure ulcer has become so deep that there is damage to the muscle and bone, and sometimes to tendons and joints.</detail><text>There are two other types of pressure sores that don't fit into the stages.</text><detail>Sores covered in dead skin that is yellow, tan, green, or brown. The dead skin makes it hard to tell how deep the sore is. This type of sore is "unstageable."</detail><detail>Pressure sores that develop in the tissue deep below the skin. This is called a deep tissue injury. The area may be dark purple or maroon. There may be a blood-filled blister under the skin. This type of skin injury can quickly become a stage III or IV pressure sore.</detail><text>Pressure sores tend to form where skin covers bony areas, such as your:</text><detail>Buttocks</detail><detail>Elbow</detail><detail>Hips</detail><detail>Heels</detail><detail>Ankles</detail><detail>Shoulders</detail><detail>Back</detail><detail>Back of head</detail></h2><h2 title="Caring for a Pressure Sore"><text>Stage I or II sores will heal if cared for carefully. Stage III and IV sores are harder to treat and may take a long time to heal. Here's how to care for a pressure sore at home.</text><text>Relieve the pressure on the area.</text><detail>Use special pillows, foam cushions, booties, or mattress pads to reduce the pressure. Some pads are water- or air-filled to help support and cushion the area. What type of cushion you use depends on your wound and whether you are in bed or in a wheelchair. Talk with your health care provider about what choices would be best for you, including what shapes and types of material.</detail><detail>Change positions often. If you are in a wheelchair, try to change your position every 15 minutes. If you are in bed, you should be moved about every 2 hours.</detail><text>Care for the sore as directed by your provider. Keep the wound clean to prevent infection. Clean the sore every time you change a dressing.</text><detail>For a stage I sore, you can wash the area gently with mild soap and water. If needed, use a moisture barrier to protect the area from bodily fluids. Ask your provider what type of moisturizer to use.</detail><detail>Stage II pressure sores should be cleaned with a salt water (saline) rinse to remove loose, dead tissue. Or, your provider may recommend a specific cleanser.</detail><detail>DO NOT use hydrogen peroxide or iodine cleansers. They can damage skin.</detail><detail>Keep the sore covered with a special dressing. This protects against infection and helps keep the sore moist so it can heal.</detail><detail>Talk with your provider about what type of dressing to use. Depending on the size and stage of the sore, you may use a film, gauze, gel, foam, or other type of dressing.</detail><detail>Most stage III and IV sores will be treated by your provider. Ask about any special instructions for home care.</detail><text>Avoid further injury or friction.</text><detail>Powder your sheets lightly so your skin doesn't rub on them in bed.</detail><detail>Avoid slipping or sliding as you move positions. Try to avoid positions that put pressure on your sore.</detail><detail>Care for healthy skin by keeping it clean and moisturized.</detail><detail>Check your skin for pressure sores every day. Ask your caregiver or someone you trust to check areas you can't see.</detail><detail>If the pressure sore changes or a new one forms, tell your provider.</detail><text>Take care of your health.</text><detail>Eat healthy foods. Getting the right nutrition will help you heal.</detail><detail>Lose excess weight.</detail><detail>Get plenty of sleep.</detail><detail>Ask your provider if it's OK to do gentle stretches or light exercises. This can help improve circulation.</detail><text>DO NOT massage the skin near or on the ulcer. This can cause more damage. DO NOT use donut-shaped or ring-shaped cushions. They reduce blood flow to the area, which may cause sores.</text></h2><h2 title="When to Call the Doctor"><text>Call your provider if you develop blisters or an open sore.</text><text>Call immediately if there are signs of infection, such as:</text><detail>A foul odor from the sore</detail><detail>Pus coming out of the sore</detail><detail>Redness and tenderness around the sore</detail><detail>Skin close to the sore is warm and/or swollen</detail><detail>Fever </detail></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>Pressure ulcer - care; Bedsore - care; Decubitus ulcer - care</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 5/12/2018"><text>Updated by: Laura J.

Learn how heat affects your body, and get tips for staying cool when it is warm out. Being prepared can help you safely work out in most conditions.</text></h2><h2 title="How Heat Affects Your Body"><text>Your body has a natural cooling system. It is always working to maintain a safe temperature. Sweating helps your body cool down.</text><text>When you exercise in the heat, your cooling system has to work harder. Your body sends more blood to your skin and away from your muscles. This increases your heart rate. You sweat a lot, losing fluids in your body. If it is humid, sweat stays on your skin, which makes it hard for your body to cool itself. </text><text>Warm-weather exercise puts you at risk for heat emergencies, such as:</text><detail>Heat cramps. Muscle cramps, usually in the legs or stomach (caused by loss of salt from sweating). This may be the first sign of overheating.</detail><detail>Heat exhaustion. Heavy sweating, cold and clammy skin, nausea and vomiting.</detail><detail>Heatstroke. When the body temperature rises above 104°F (40°C). Heatstroke is a life-threatening condition. </detail><text>Children, older adults, and obese people have a higher risk for these illnesses. People taking certain medicines and people with heart disease also have a higher risk. However, even a top athlete in superb condition can get heat illness.</text></h2><h2 title="Stay Cool During Exercise"><text>Try these tips to help prevent heat-related illness:</text><detail>Drink plenty of fluids. Drink before, during, and after your workout. Drink even if you do not feel thirsty. You can tell you are getting enough if your urine is light or very pale yellow.</detail><detail>DO NOT drink alcohol, caffeine, or drinks with a lot of sugar, such as soda. They can cause you to lose fluids.</detail><detail>Water is your best choice for less-intense workouts. If you will be exercising for a couple of hours, you may want to choose a sports drink. These replace salts and minerals as well as fluids. Choose lower-calorie options. They have less sugar.</detail><detail>Make sure the water or sports drinks are cool, but not too cold. Very cold drinks may cause stomach cramps.</detail><detail>Limit your training on very hot days. Try training in early morning or later at night.</detail><detail>Choose the right clothing for your activity. Lighter colors and wicking fabrics are good choices.</detail><detail>Protect yourself from direct sun with sunglasses and a hat. DO NOT forget sunscreen (SPF 30 or higher).</detail><detail>Rest often in shady areas or try to stay on the shady side of a walking or hiking trail.</detail><detail>DO NOT take salt tablets.

<item><title>How to avoid exercise injuries</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000859.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>Regular exercise is good for your body and safe for most everyone. However, with any type of activity, there is a chance you can get hurt. Exercise injuries can range from strains and sprains to back pain.</text><text>With a little planning, you can prevent injury and stay safe during exercise.</text></h2><h2 title="What Causes Exercise Injuries?"><text>Some of the most common causes of exercise injuries include:</text><detail>Exercising before your body has warmed up</detail><detail>Repeating the same motion over and over again</detail><detail>Not having proper form for your exercise</detail><detail>Not resting in between workouts</detail><detail>Pushing your body too hard or too quickly</detail><detail>Doing an exercise that is too strenuous for your level of fitness</detail><detail>Not using proper equipment </detail></h2><h2 title="Warm up and Cool Down"><text>Warming up before exercise gets your blood flowing, warms up your muscles, and helps you avoid injury. The easiest way to warm up is to exercise slowly for the first few minutes, then pick up the pace. For example, before running, walk briskly for 5 to 10 minutes. </text><text>You should also cool down after exercise to bring your heart rate and body temperature back to normal. Cool down by ending your routine at a slower pace for the last 5 to 10 minutes. </text></h2><h2 title="To Stretch or not to Stretch"><text>To stay flexible, you should stretch at least 2 times a week. But it is unclear whether stretching really helps reduce injury. </text><text>You can stretch either after you have warmed up or after you exercise.</text><detail>DO NOT stretch cold muscles.</detail><detail>Hold stretches for no longer than 15 to 30 seconds.</detail><detail>DO NOT bounce. </detail></h2><h2 title="Choose Your Exercise Wisely"><text>If you have not been active, or have a health condition, talk with your health care provider to make sure you are healthy enough for exercise. Ask what types of exercise might be best for you. </text><text>If you are new to exercise, you may want to start with low-intensity options such as:</text><detail>Walking</detail><detail>Swimming</detail><detail>Riding a stationary bike</detail><detail>Golf </detail><text>These types of exercise are less likely to cause injury than higher-impact activities like running or aerobics. Contact sports like soccer or basketball are also more likely to cause injury.</text></h2><h2 title="Use the Right Equipment"><text>Using safety equipment can greatly reduce your risk of injury. </text><text>Safety equipment for your sport may include:</text><detail>Footwear</detail><detail>Helmets</detail><detail>Mouth guards</detail><detail>Goggles</detail><detail>Shin guards or other protective guards</detail><detail>Kneepads </detail><text>Be sure you use the right type of equipment for your sport. For example, DO NOT play tennis in running shoes. Wear a ski helmet, not a bike helmet, when downhill skiing.</text><text>Make sure your exercise equipment:</text><detail>Fits you properly</detail><detail>Is the right design for your sport or activity</detail><detail>Is in good working condition</detail><detail>Is used correctly and consistently </detail></h2><h2 title="Learn Good Form"><text>If you are new to an exercise or sport, consider taking lessons to learn the basics. Learning the right way to do an exercise or sport can help prevent injury. Look for lessons in your community or through sports or outdoors organizations. You can also consider hiring a personal trainer.</text></h2><h2 title="Cross Train"><text>To help prevent overuse injuries, vary your workouts. For example, instead of running 3 days a week, cycle 1 day and run 2. You will use a different set of muscles, and still get a good workout.</text></h2><h2 title="Listen to Your Body"><text>Forget the old saying "no pain, no gain." Of course, to build strength and stamina, you will need to push your body. The key is to push slowly and gradually. You can expect sore muscles after your workout. But you should never feel pain when exercising. If you feel pain, stop right away.</text><text>Being tired all the time can also be a sign that you may be overdoing it. In general, avoid increasing these 3 things all at the same time:</text><detail>Number of days you exercise</detail><detail>Length of time you exercise</detail><detail>How hard you work out</detail><text>If you do have an injury, you can try to treat strains and sprains at home.</text></h2><h2 title="When to Call the Doctor"><text>Call your provider for any muscle or joint pain that does not go away after self-care.</text><text>Go to the hospital right away or call 911 if:</text><detail>You have chest pain during or after exercise.</detail><detail>You think you have a broken bone.</detail><detail>The joint appears out of position.</detail><detail>You have a serious injury or severe pain or bleeding.</detail><detail>You hear a popping sound and have immediate problems using the joint.</detail></h2><h2 title="Review Date 8/3/2018"><text>Updated by: Linda J.

<item><title>How childhood cancers are different from adult cancers</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000845.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>Childhood cancers are not the same as adult cancers. The type of cancer, how far it spreads, and how it is treated is often different than adult cancers. Children's bodies and the way they respond to treatments are unique as well. </text><text>Keep this in mind when reading about cancer. Some cancer research is based on adults only. Your child's cancer care team can help you understand your child's cancer and the best options for treatment.</text><text>One big difference is that the chance of recovery is high in children. Most children with cancer can be cured.</text></h2><h2 title="Types of Childhood Cancers"><text>Cancer in children is rare, but some types are more common than others. When cancer occurs in children, it often affects:</text><detail>Blood cells</detail><detail>Lymph system</detail><detail>Brain</detail><detail>Liver</detail><detail>Bones </detail><text>The most common cancer in children affects blood cells. It is called acute lymphocytic leukemia.</text><text>While these cancers can happen in adults, they are less common. Other types of cancer, such as prostate, breast, colon, and lung are more likely in adults than children.</text></h2><h2 title="What Causes Childhood Cancer"><text>Many times, the cause of a childhood cancer is not known. </text><text>Some cancers are linked to changes in certain genes (mutations) passed from parent to child. In some children, gene changes that occur during early growth in the womb increase the risk of leukemia. However, not all children with the mutation get cancer. Children born with Down syndrome are also more likely to get leukemia. </text><text>Unlike adult cancers, childhood cancers do not occur due to lifestyle choices, like diet and smoking. </text><text>It is hard to study childhood cancer because it is rare. Scientists have looked at other risk factors including chemicals, toxins, and factors from the mother and father. The results of these studies are unclear.</text></h2><h2 title="Diagnosis"><text>Cancer is usually found at a later stage in children compared to adults. It has often spread to other organs or tissues. In adults, cancer is often found in an earlier stage, but not always.</text></h2><h2 title="Treatments"><text>Treatment for childhood cancer is similar to treatment for adult cancer. It may include:</text><detail>Chemotherapy</detail><detail>Radiation therapy</detail><detail>Medicines</detail><detail>Immune therapy</detail><detail>Stem cell transplants</detail><detail>Surgery </detail><text>For children, the amount of therapy, type of medicine, or need for surgery may differ from adults.</text><text>In many cases, the cancer cells in children respond better to treatments compared to adults. Children can often handle higher doses of chemo drugs for shorter periods before side effects occur. Children seem to bounce back sooner from treatments compared to adults. </text><text>Some treatments or medicines given to adults are not safe for children. Your health care team will help you to understand what is right for your child depending on his or her age.</text><text>Children with cancer are best treated in children's cancer centers attached to major children's hospitals or universities. </text></h2><h2 title="Side Effects"><text>Treatment for cancer may cause side effects. </text><text>Mild side effects, such as rash, pain, and upset stomach can be bothersome for children. The medicines used to help reduce these symptoms may be different for children compared to adults.</text><text>Other side effects can harm their growing bodies. Organs and tissue may be changed by treatments and affect how they function. Cancer treatments may also delay growth in children, or cause another cancer to form later on. Sometimes these harms are noticed weeks or several years after treatment. These are called "late effects."</text><text>Your child will be watched closely by your health care team for many years to look for any late side effects. Many of them can be managed or treated. </text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 7/26/2018"><text>Updated by: Todd Gersten, MD, Hematology/Oncology, Florida Cancer Specialists &amp;amp; Research Institute, Wellington, FL.

Learn when you should get rid of unused medicines and how to dispose of them safely.</text></h2><h2 title="When to Get Rid of Medicines"><text>You should get rid of a medicine when:</text><detail>Your health care provider changes your prescription but you still have some medicine left</detail><detail>You feel better and your provider says you should stop taking the medicine</detail><detail>You have OTC medicines that you no longer need</detail><detail>You have medicines that are past their expiration dates </detail><text>DO NOT take expired medicines. They may not be as effective or the ingredients of the medicine may have changed. This can make them unsafe for use.</text><text>Read the labels regularly to check the expiration date of a medicine. Discard any that have expired and those you no longer need. </text><text>Storing expired or unwanted medicines can increase the risk of:</text><detail>Taking the wrong medicine due to mix-ups</detail><detail>Accidental poisoning in children or pets</detail><detail>Overdose</detail><detail>Misuse or illegal abuse </detail></h2><h2 title="How to Dispose of Expired Medicines Safely"><text>Disposing medicines safely prevents others from using them accidentally or intentionally. It also prevents harmful residues from getting into the environment. </text><text>Look for disposal instructions on the label or information booklet. </text><text>DO NOT FLUSH UNUSED MEDICINES</text><text>You should not flush most medicines or pour them down the drain. Medicines contain chemicals that may not break down in the environment. When flushed down the toilet or sink, these residues can pollute our water resources. This may affect fish and other marine life. These residues can also end up in our drinking water.</text><text>However, some medicines must be disposed of as soon as possible to reduce their potential harm. You can flush them to prevent someone from using them. These include opioids or narcotics usually prescribed for pain. You should ONLY flush medicines when it specifically says to do so on the label.</text><text>DRUG TAKE-BACK PROGRAMS</text><text>The best way to dispose of your medicines is to bring them to drug take-back programs. These programs safely dispose of medicines by burning them up. </text><text>Drug take-back programs are organized from time to time in most communities. Or, your town may have special days when you can bring hazardous household items such as unused medicines to a specific location for disposal. Contact your local trash and recycling service to find out when the next event is scheduled in your community.</text><text>Medicines NOT accepted by most drug take-back programs include:</text><detail>Liquid medicines</detail><detail>Needles</detail><detail>Sprays</detail><detail>Inhalers</detail><detail>Creams </detail><text>HOUSEHOLD DISPOSAL</text><text>If you don't have a take-back program available, you can throw your medicines out with your household trash. To do so safely:</text><detail>Take the medicine out of its container and mix it with other unpleasant garbage such as kitty litter or used coffee grounds. DO NOT crush pills or capsules.</detail><detail>Place the mixture into a sealable plastic bag or sealed contain that won't leak.</detail><detail>Be sure to remove your Rx number and all personal information from the medicine bottle. Scratch it off or cover it with a permanent marker or duct tape.</detail><detail>Throw the container and pill bottles out with the rest of your trash. </detail></h2><h2 title="When to Call the Doctor"><text>Call your provider if:</text><detail>Someone consumes expired medicines accidentally or on purpose</detail><detail>You have an allergic reaction to a medicine </detail></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>Disposal of unused medicines; Expired medicines; Unused medicines</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 12/10/2016"><text>Updated by: Linda J.

This helps slow the growth of prostate cancer.</text></h2><h2 title="Male Hormones and Prostate Cancer "><text>Androgens are male sex hormones. Testosterone is one main type of androgen. Most testosterone is made by the testicles. The adrenal glands also produce a small amount. </text><text>Androgens cause prostate cancer cells to grow. Hormone therapy for prostate cancer lowers the effect level of androgens in the body. It can do this by:</text><detail>Stopping the testicles from making androgens using surgery or medicines</detail><detail>Blocking the action of androgens in the body</detail><detail>Stopping the body from making androgens </detail></h2><h2 title="When is Hormone Therapy Used?"><text>Hormone therapy is almost never used for people with Stage I or Stage II prostate cancer.</text><text>It is mainly used for:</text><detail>Advanced cancer that has spread beyond the prostate gland</detail><detail>Cancer that has failed to respond to surgery or radiation</detail><detail>Cancer that has recurred </detail><text>It may also be used:</text><detail>Before radiation or surgery to help shrink tumors</detail><detail>Along with radiation therapy for cancer that is likely to recur </detail></h2><h2 title="Drugs That Lower Androgen Levels "><text>The most common treatment is to take drugs that lower the amount of androgens made by the testicles. They are called luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) analogs. These drugs lower androgen levels just as well as surgery does. This type of treatment is sometimes called "chemical castration." </text><text>Men who receive androgen deprivation therapy should have follow-up exams with the doctor prescribing the drugs:</text><detail>Within 3 to 6 months after starting therapy</detail><detail>At least once a year, to monitor blood pressure and perform blood sugar (glucose) and cholesterol tests</detail><detail>To get PSA blood tests to monitor how well the therapy is working </detail><text>LHRH analogs are given as a shot or as a small implant placed under the skin. They are given anywhere from once a month to once a year. These drugs include: </text><detail>Leuprolide (Lupron, Eligard)</detail><detail>Goserelin (Zoladex)</detail><detail>Triptorelin(Trelstar)</detail><detail>Histrelin (Vantas) </detail><text>Another medicine, degarelix (Firmagon), is an LHRH antagonist. It reduces androgen levels more quickly and has fewer side effects. It is used in men with advanced cancer.</text><text>Some doctors recommend stopping and restarting treatment (intermittent therapy). This approach appears to help reduce hormone therapy side effects. However, it is not clear if intermittent therapy works as well as continuous therapy. Some studies indicate that continuous therapy is more effective or that intermittent therapy should only be used for select types of prostate cancer.</text><text>Surgery to remove the testicles (castration) stops the production of most androgens in the body. This also shrinks or stops prostate cancer from growing. While effective, most men do not choose this option.</text></h2><h2 title="Drugs That Block Androgen"><text>Some drugs that work by blocking the effect of androgen on prostate cancer cells. They are called anti-androgens. These drugs are taken as pills. They are often used when medicines to lower androgen levels are no longer working as well.</text><text>Anti-androgens include:</text><detail>Flutamide (Eulexin)</detail><detail>Enzalutamide (Xtandi)</detail><detail>Bicalutamide (Casodex)</detail><detail>Nilutamide (Nilandron)</detail></h2><h2 title="Drugs That Stop the Body From Making Androgens"><text>Androgens can be produced in other areas of the body, such as the adrenal glands. Some prostate cancer cells can also make androgens. Three drugs help to stop the body from making androgens from tissue other than the testicles. </text><text>Two medicines, ketoconazole (Nizoral) and aminoglutethimide (Cytradren), treat other diseases but are sometimes used to treat prostate cancer. The third, abiraterone (Zytiga) treats advanced prostate cancer that has spread to other places in the body. </text></h2><h2 title="When Hormone Therapy Stops Working"><text>Over time, prostate cancer becomes resistant to hormone therapy. This means that cancer only needs low levels of androgen to grow. When this occurs, additional drugs or other treatments may be added.</text></h2><h2 title="Side Effects "><text>Androgens have effects all over the body. So treatments that lower these hormones can cause many different side effects. The longer you take these medicines, the more likely you are to have side effects.</text><text>They include:</text><detail>Trouble getting an erection and not being interested in sex</detail><detail>Shrinking testicles and penis</detail><detail>Hot flashes</detail><detail>Weakened or broken bones</detail><detail>Smaller, weaker muscles</detail><detail>Changes in blood fats, such as cholesterol</detail><detail>Changes in blood sugar</detail><detail>Weight gain</detail><detail>Mood swings</detail><detail>Fatigue</detail><detail>Growth of breast tissue, breast tenderness </detail><text>Androgen deprivation therapy can increase the risks for diabetes and heart disease.</text></h2><h2 title="Weighing the Options"><text>Deciding on hormonal therapy for prostate cancer can be a complex and even difficult decision.

This helps slow the growth of many breast cancers. </text><text>Hormone therapy makes cancer less likely to return after breast cancer surgery. It also slows the growth of breast cancer that has spread to other parts of the body. </text><text>Hormone therapy can also be used to help prevent cancer in women at high risk for breast cancer.</text><text>It is different from hormone therapy to treat menopause symptoms.</text></h2><h2 title="Hormones and Breast Cancer "><text>The hormones estrogen and progesterone make some breast cancers grow. They are called hormone-sensitive breast cancers. Most breast cancers are sensitive to hormones. </text><text>Estrogen and progesterone are produced in the ovaries and other tissues such as fat and skin. After menopause, the ovaries stop producing these hormones. But the body continues to make a small amount. </text><text>Hormone therapy only works on hormone-sensitive cancers. To see if hormone therapy may work, doctors test a sample of the tumor that has been removed during surgery to see if the cancer might be sensitive to hormones. </text><text>Hormone therapy can work in two ways:</text><detail>By blocking the estrogen from acting on cancer cells</detail><detail>By lowering estrogen levels in a woman's body</detail></h2><h2 title="Drugs That Block Estrogen "><text>Some drugs work by blocking estrogen from causing cancer cells to grow.</text><text>Tamoxifen (Nolvadex) is a drug that prevents estrogen from telling cancer cells to grow.

But, these drugs do not work to make the ovaries stop making estrogen. For this reason, they are used mainly to lower estrogen levels in women who have been through menopause (postmenopausal). Their ovaries no longer make estrogen.</text><text>Premenopausal women can take AIs if they are also taking drugs that stop their ovaries from making estrogen. </text><text>Aromatase inhibitors include:</text><detail>Anastrozole (Arimidex)</detail><detail>Letrozole (Femara)</detail><detail>Exemestane (Aromasin) </detail></h2><h2 title="Lowering Estrogen Levels From the Ovaries"><text>This type of treatment only works in premenopausal women who have functioning ovaries.

Car seats, safe cribs, and strollers help protect your child in and near the home. Yet, parents and caregivers still have to be careful and cautious. Explain certain dangers to children. This can help them understand why and how they can stay safe.</text><text>All teens and adults should learn CPR.</text></h2><h2 title="Poisoning"><text>Teach your child about poisons that may be in the home or in the yard. Your child should know about not eating berries or leaves from unknown plants. Almost any substance, when eaten in large enough amounts, can be harmful or poisonous.</text><text>Only buy toys that say non-toxic on the label.</text><text>In the home:</text><detail>Keep cleaning fluids, bug poisons, and other chemicals out of a child's reach. DO NOT store toxic substances in unmarked or inappropriate containers (such as food containers). Keep these things locked up if possible.</detail><detail>DO NOT use pesticides on plants if possible.</detail><detail>Buy medicines with child-resistant caps. Store all medicines out of the reach of children.</detail><detail>Keep cosmetics and nail polish out of reach.</detail><detail>Put safety latches on cabinets that a child should not open. </detail><text>If you suspect poisoning or have questions, contact the American Association of Poison Control Centers:</text><detail>Poison Help Line -- 800-222-1222</detail><detail>Text "POISON" to 797979</detail><detail>www.poisonhelp.org  </detail><picname>Home safety</picname><picurl>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/images/ency/fullsize/19648.jpg</picurl></h2><h2 title="Preventing Falls"><text>Always keep one hand on an infant who is lying on a changing table.</text><text>Place gates at the top and bottom of each stairway. Gates that screw into the wall are best. Follow the manufacturer's safety instructions.</text><text>Teach your child how to climb up the stairs. When they are ready to climb down, show them how to go down steps backwards on their hands and knees. Show toddlers how to walk down steps one step at a time, holding on to someone's hand, a handrail, or the wall.</text><text>Injury due to falls from windows can occur from even a first or second story window as well as from a high-rise. Follow these simple suggestions:</text><detail>DO NOT put a crib or bed near a window that a child can open.</detail><detail>Place guards on windows to prevent them from opening wide enough for a child to fit through.</detail><detail>Make sure fire escapes are not accessible or have adequate fencing. </detail><text>Tips for avoiding falls from bunk beds include:</text><detail>Children, 6 years old and younger, should not sleep in the top bunk. They lack the coordination to prevent themselves from falling.</detail><detail>Put bunk beds in a corner with walls on two sides. Make sure the guardrail and ladder for the top bunk are firmly attached.</detail><detail>DO NOT allow jumping or roughhousing on top of or underneath the bed.</detail><detail>Have a night light in the room. </detail></h2><h2 title="Firearms"><text>Keep guns locked up and unloaded. Guns and ammunition should be stored separately.</text><text>Never claim you have a gun with you just as a prank. Never say, even as a joke, that you are going to shoot someone.</text><text>Help children understand the difference between real guns and weapons they see on TV, movies, or video games. A gunshot can permanently injure or kill someone.</text><text>Teach children what to do when they come across a gun:</text><detail>Stop and do not touch. This means not to play with the gun.</detail><detail>Leave the area. If you stay and someone else touches the gun, you may be in danger.</detail><detail>Tell an adult right away. </detail></h2><h2 title="Choking"><text>Keep your child safe by taking action to prevent choking.</text><detail>Keep toys with small parts out of the reach of infants and toddlers.

Most vehicles do not have rear-mounted cameras.</detail><detail>Never leave your child unattended near streets or traffic. </detail><text>Important tips for safety in the yard include:</text><detail>Never use a power mower when a child is in the yard. Sticks, rocks, and other objects can be thrown at high speeds by the mower and injure the child.</detail><detail>Keep children away from hot cooking grills. Keep matches, lighters, and charcoal fuel locked up. DO NOT dump charcoal ashes out until you are sure they are cool.</detail><detail>Put child-proof covers on grill knobs.

Record the results. This will tell you how well you are managing your diabetes.</text><text>Not everyone with diabetes needs to check their blood sugar every day. Others need to check it many times a day.</text><text>Checking blood sugar helps you stay on track with your nutrition and activity plans.</text></h2><h2 title="Check Your Blood Sugar Often"><text>Usual times to test your blood sugar are before meals and at bedtime. Your provider may ask you to check your blood sugar 2 hours after a meal or even sometimes in the middle of the night. Ask your provider when you should check your blood sugar.</text><text>Other times to check your blood sugar may be:</text><detail>If you are having symptoms of low blood sugar (hypoglycemia)</detail><detail>After you eat out, especially if you have eaten foods you don't normally eat</detail><detail>If you feel sick</detail><detail>Before or after you exercise</detail><detail>If you have been under a lot of stress</detail><detail>If you eat too much or skip meals or snacks</detail><detail>If you are taking new medicines, took too much insulin or diabetes medicine by mistake, or took your medicine at the wrong time</detail><detail>If your blood sugar has been higher or lower than normal</detail><detail>If you are drinking alcohol </detail></h2><h2 title="How to Prepare for the Test"><text>Have all test items within reach before starting. Timing is important. Clean the needle prick area with soap and water. Completely dry the skin before pricking.</text></h2><h2 title="How the Test is Done"><text>You can buy a testing kit from a pharmacy without a prescription. Your provider can help you choose the right kit, set up the meter, and teach you how to use it.</text><text>Most kits have: </text><detail>Test strips</detail><detail>Small needles (lancets) that fit into a spring-loaded plastic device</detail><detail>A logbook for recording your numbers that can be downloaded and viewed at home or at your provider's office </detail><text>To do the test, prick your finger with the needle and place a drop of blood on a special strip. This strip measures how much glucose is in your blood. Some monitors use blood from areas of the body other than the fingers, reducing discomfort.

<item><title>Home apnea monitor use - infants</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000755.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>A home apnea monitor is a machine used to monitor a baby's heart rate and breathing after coming home from the hospital. Apnea is breathing that slows down or stops from any cause. An alarm on the monitor goes off when your baby's heart rate or breathing slows or stops.</text><text>The monitor is small and portable.</text></h2><h2 title="Why is an Apnea Monitor Used at Home?"><text>A monitor may be needed when:</text><detail>Your baby has ongoing apnea</detail><detail>Your baby has severe reflux</detail><detail>Your baby needs to be on oxygen or a breathing machine </detail><text>The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that home monitors should not be used to reduce the risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). Babies should be put on their backs or sides to sleep to reduce the chance of SIDS.</text></h2><h2 title="How Does my Baby get Started on an Apnea Monitor?"><text>A home health care company comes to your home to teach you how to use the monitor. They provide support to you as long as you are using the monitor. Call them if you are having trouble with the monitor.</text><text>To use the monitor:</text><detail>Put the stick-on patches (called electrodes) or the belt on your baby's chest or stomach.</detail><detail>Attach the wires from the electrodes to the monitor.</detail><detail>Turn on the monitor. </detail></h2><h2 title="How Long Will my Baby Wear an Apnea Monitor?"><text>How long your baby stays on the monitor depends on how often real alarms go off. Real alarms mean your baby does not have a steady heart rate or is having trouble breathing.</text><text>The alarm can go off when your baby moves around. But the baby's heart rate and breathing may actually be fine. Do not worry about alarms going off because your baby is moving.</text><text>Babies usually wear a home apnea monitor for 2 to 3 months. Discuss with your baby's health care provider how long your baby needs to stay on the monitor. </text></h2><h2 title="What are the Risks of an Apnea Monitor?"><text>Your baby's skin could get irritated from the stick-on electrodes. This is usually not a major problem.</text><text>If you lose electrical power or have problems with your electricity, the apnea monitor will not work. This does not put your baby at risk. It will not make your baby's heart rate go down or breathing stop. You will not be able to use the monitor until the electricity is back on.</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 9/5/2017"><text>Updated by: Neil K.

You will need to learn exercises that make your new hip stronger and take special precautions. </text><text>You will need to have someone with you at home 24 hours a day for 1 to 2 weeks after you leave the hospital or rehab center. You will need help preparing meals, bathing, moving around the house, and doing other daily activities.</text><text>Over time, you should be able to return to your former level of activity. You will need to avoid some sports, such as downhill skiing or contact sports like football and soccer. But you should be able to do low impact activities, such as hiking, gardening, swimming, playing tennis, and golfing.</text></h2><h2 title="Home Setup "><text>Your bed should be low enough for your feet to touch the floor when you sit on the edge of the bed. Your bed should also be high enough so that your hips are higher than your knees when you sit on the edge. You will not need a hospital bed, but your mattress should be firm.</text><text>Keep tripping hazards out of your home.</text><detail>Learn to prevent falls. Remove loose wires or cords from areas you walk through to get from one room to another. Remove loose throw rugs. DO NOT keep small pets in your home. Fix any uneven flooring in doorways. Use good lighting.</detail><detail>Make your bathroom safe. Put hand rails in the bathtub or shower and next to the toilet.

Some tips are:</text><detail>Set up a bed or use a bedroom on the first floor.</detail><detail>Have a bathroom or a portable commode on the same floor where you spend most of your day. </detail></h2><h2 title="Activity"><text>You will need to be careful to not dislocate your new hip when you are walking, sitting, lying down, dressing, taking a bath or shower, and doing other activities. </text><text>Keep moving and walking once you get home. DO NOT put your full weight on your side with the new hip until your provider tells you it is OK. Start out with short periods of activity, and then gradually increase them. Your provider or physical therapist will give you exercises to do at home.</text><text>Use your crutches or walker for as long as you need them. Check with your provider before you stop using them.</text><text>After a few days you may be able to do simple household chores. DO NOT try to do heavier chores, such as vacuuming or laundry. Remember, you will get tired quickly at first.</text><text>Wear a small fanny pack or backpack, or attach a basket or strong bag to your walker, so that you can keep small household items, like a phone and notepad, with you.</text></h2><h2 title="Wound Care"><text>Keep your dressing (bandage) on your wound clean and dry. You may change the dressing according to when your provider told you to change it. Be sure to change it if it gets dirty or wet. Follow these steps when you change your dressing:</text><detail>Wash your hands well with soap and water.</detail><detail>Remove the dressing carefully. DO NOT pull hard. If you need to, soak some of the dressing with sterile water or saline to help loosen it.</detail><detail>Soak some clean gauze with saline and wipe from one end of the incision to the other. DO NOT wipe back and forth over the same area.</detail><detail>Dry the incision the same way with clean, dry gauze. Wipe or pat in just 1 direction.</detail><detail>Check your wound for signs of infection. These include severe swelling and redness and drainage that has a bad odor.</detail><detail>Apply a new dressing the way you were shown. </detail><text>Sutures (stitches) or staples will be removed about 10 to 14 days after surgery. DO NOT shower until 3 to 4 days after your surgery, or when your provider told you to shower. When you can shower, let water run over your incision but DO NOT scrub it or let the water beat down on it. DO NOT soak in a bathtub, hot tub, or swimming pool.</text><text>You may have bruising around your wound. This is normal, and it will go away on its own. The skin around your incision may be a little red. This is normal too.</text></h2><h2 title="Self-care"><text>Your provider will give you a prescription for pain medicines. Get it filled when you go home so you have it when you need it. Take your pain medicine when you start having pain. Waiting too long to take it will allow your pain to get more severe than it should.</text><text>In the early part of your recovery, taking pain medicine about 30 minutes before you increase your activity can help control pain.</text><text>You may be asked to wear special compression stockings on your legs for about 6 weeks. These will help prevent blood clots from forming. You may also need to take blood thinners for 2 to 4 weeks to lower your risk of blood clots. Take all your medicines the way your provider told you to. It can make your bruise go away more easily.</text><text>Your provider will tell you when it is OK to start sexual activity again.</text><text>People who have a prosthesis, such as an artificial joint, need to carefully protect themselves against infection. You should carry a medical identification card in your wallet that says you have a prosthesis. You will need to take antibiotics before any dental work or invasive medical procedures.

This includes going to the bathroom and taking walks in the hallways with help.</text><text>After knee replacement, some surgeons recommend using a continuous passive motion machine (CPM) while you are in bed. The CPM bends your knee for you. Over time, the rate and amount of bending will increase. If you are using this machine, always keep your leg in the CPM when you are in bed. It may help speed your recovery and reduce pain, bleeding, and risk of infection.</text><text>You will learn the proper positions for your legs and knees. Make sure you follow these guidelines. Improper positioning can injure your new hip or knee joint.</text></h2><h2 title="Getting Ready to go Home"><text>Before you go home, you will need to:</text><detail>Be able to move or transfer in and out of bed, in and out of chairs, and off and on the toilet without help</detail><detail>Bend your knees almost to a right angle or 90° (after knee replacement)</detail><detail>Walk on a level surface with crutches or a walker, without any other help</detail><detail>Walk up and down some steps with help </detail><text>Some people need a short stay in a rehabilitation center or a skilled nursing facility after they leave the hospital and before they go home.

<item><title>Hip fracture - discharge </title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000168.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>Hip fracture surgery is done to repair a break in the upper part of your thigh bone. This article tells you how to take care of yourself when you go home from the hospital.</text></h2><h2 title="When You're in the Hospital "><text>You were in the hospital for surgery to repair a hip fracture, a break in the upper part of your thigh bone. You may have had hip pinning surgery or a special metal plate or rod with screws, called compression screws or nails, put in place. Alternatively, you may have had a hip replacement to replace your hip joint.</text><text>You should have received physical therapy while you were in the hospital or at a rehabilitation center before going home from the hospital.</text></h2><h2 title="What to Expect at Home"><text>Most of the problems that develop after hip fracture surgery can be prevented by getting out of bed and walking as soon as possible. For this reason, it is very important to stay active and follow the instructions your health care provider gave you.</text><text>You may have bruises around your incision. These will go away. It is normal for the skin around your incision to be a little red. It is also normal to have a small amount of watery or dark bloody fluid draining from your incision for several days.</text><text>It is not normal to have foul smell or drainage that last more than the first 3 to 4 days after surgery. It is also not normal when the wound starts to hurt more after leaving the hospital.</text></h2><h2 title="Activity "><text>Do the exercises your physical therapist taught you. Ask your provider how much weight you can put on your leg. You should be using crutches and walker when you leave the hospital. Your provider and physical therapist will help you decide when you do not need crutches, a cane, or a walker anymore.</text><text>Ask your provider or physical therapist about when to start using a stationary bicycle and swimming as extra exercises to build your muscles and bones.</text><text>Try not to sit for more than 45 minutes at a time without getting up and moving around.</text><detail>DO NOT sit in low chairs that put your knees higher than your hips. Choose chairs with arm rests to make it easier to stand up.</detail><detail>Sit with your feet flat on the floor, and point your feet and legs outward a little. DO NOT cross your legs. </detail><text>DO NOT bend at the waist or the hips when you put your shoes and socks on. DO NOT bend down to pick up things from the floor.</text><text>Use a raised toilet seat for the first couple of weeks. Your provider will tell you when it is OK to use a regular toilet seat. DO NOT sleep on your stomach or on the side you had your surgery.</text></h2><h2 title="Home Setup "><text>Have a bed that is low enough so that your feet touch the floor when you sit on the edge of the bed.</text><text>Keep tripping hazards out of your home.</text><detail>Learn to prevent falls. Remove loose wires or cords from areas you walk through to get from one room to another. Remove loose throw rugs. DO NOT keep small pets in your home. Fix any uneven flooring in doorways. Use good lighting.</detail><detail>Make your bathroom safe. Put hand rails in the bathtub or shower and next to the toilet. Place a slip-proof mat in the bathtub or shower.</detail><detail>DO NOT carry anything when you are walking around. You may need your hands to help you balance. </detail><text>Put things where they are easy to reach. </text><text>Set up your home so that you do not have to climb steps. Some tips are:</text><detail>Set up a bed or use a bedroom on the first floor.</detail><detail>Have a bathroom or a portable commode on the same floor where you spend most of your day. </detail><text>If you do not have someone to help you at home for the first 1 to 2 weeks, ask your provider about having a trained caregiver come to your home to help you.</text></h2><h2 title="Wound Care"><text>You may start showering again when your provider says it is OK. After you shower, gently pat the incision area dry with a clean towel. DO NOT rub it dry.</text><text>DO NOT soak your wound in a bathtub, swimming pool, or hot tub until your provider says it is OK.</text><text>Change your dressing (bandage) over your incision every day if your provider says it is OK. Gently wash the wound with soap and water and pat it dry. </text><text>Check your incision for any signs of infection at least once a day. These signs include: </text><detail>More redness</detail><detail>More drainage</detail><detail>When the wound is opening up </detail></h2><h2 title="Other Self-care"><text>To prevent another fracture, do everything you can to make your bones strong.</text><detail>Ask your provider to check you for osteoporosis (thin, weak bones) after you have healed from your surgery and are able to more tests. There may be treatments that can help with weak bone.</detail><detail>If you smoke, stop. Ask your provider for help quitting. Smoking will keep your bone from healing.</detail><detail>Tell your provider if you drink alcohol regularly. You might have a bad reaction from taking pain medicine and drinking alcohol. Alcohol may also make it harder to recovery from surgery. </detail><text>Keep wearing the compression stockings you used in the hospital until your provider says you can stop. Wearing them for at least 2 or 3 weeks may help reduce clots after surgery. You may also be given a blood thinner. This may be in pill form or by injection.</text><text>If you have pain, take the pain medicines were prescribed. Getting up and moving around can also help reduce your pain.</text><text>If you have problems with your eyesight or hearing, get them checked.</text><text>Be careful not to get pressure sores (also called pressure ulcers or bed sores) from staying in bed or a chair for long periods of time. </text></h2><h2 title="When to Call the Doctor"><text>Call your health care provider if you have:</text><detail>Shortness of breath or chest pain when you breathe</detail><detail>Frequent urination or burning when you urinate</detail><detail>Redness or increasing pain around your incision</detail><detail>Drainage from your incision</detail><detail>Swelling in one of your legs (it will be red and warmer than the other leg)</detail><detail>Pain in your calf</detail><detail>Fever higher than 101°F (38.3°C)</detail><detail>Pain that is not controlled by your pain medicines</detail><detail>Nosebleeds or blood in your urine or stools, if you are taking blood thinners </detail></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>Inter-trochanteric fracture repair - discharge; Subtrochanteric fracture repair - discharge; Femoral neck fracture repair - discharge; Trochanteric fracture repair - discharge; Hip pinning surgery - discharge</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 11/27/2016"><text>Updated by: C.

<item><title>Hip flexor strain - aftercare</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000682.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>The hip flexors are a group of muscles toward the front of the hip. They help you move, or flex, your leg and knee up towards your body.</text><text>A hip flexor strain occurs when one or more of the hip flexor muscles becomes stretched or torn.</text></h2><h2 title="More About Your Injury"><text>Hip flexors allow you to bend your knee and flex your hip. Sudden movements, such as sprinting, kicking, and changing direction while running or moving, can stretch and tear the hip flexors.</text><text>Runners, people who do martial arts, and football, soccer, and hockey players are more likely to have this type of injury.</text><text>Other factors that can lead to hip flexor strain include:</text><detail>Weak muscles</detail><detail>Not warming up</detail><detail>Stiff muscles</detail><detail>Trauma or falls </detail></h2><h2 title="What to Expect"><text>You will feel a hip flexor strain in the front area where your thigh meets your hip. Depending on how bad the strain is, you may notice:</text><detail>Mild pain and pulling in the front of the hip.</detail><detail>Cramping and sharp pain. It may be hard to walk without limping.</detail><detail>Difficulty getting out of a chair or coming up from a squat.</detail><detail>Severe pain, spasms, bruising, and swelling. The top of the thigh muscle may budge. It will be hard to walk. These are signs of a complete tear, which is less common. You may have some bruising down the front of your thigh a few days after injury. </detail><text>You may need to use crutches for a severe strain.</text></h2><h2 title="Symptom Relief"><text>Follow these steps for the first few days or weeks after your injury:</text><detail>Rest. Stop any activity that causes pain.</detail><detail>Ice the area for 20 minutes every 3 to 4 hours for 2 to 3 days. DO NOT apply ice directly to your skin. Wrap the ice in a clean cloth first.</detail><text>You can use ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), or naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn) to reduce pain and swelling. Acetaminophen (Tylenol) helps with pain, but not with swelling. You can buy these pain medicines at the store.</text><detail>Talk with your doctor before using pain medicines if you have heart disease, high blood pressure, kidney disease, or have had stomach ulcers or internal bleeding in the past.</detail><detail>DO NOT take more than the amount recommended on the bottle or by your doctor.</detail></h2><h2 title="Activity"><text>Your doctor may recommend that as you rest the area, you do exercises that don't strain the hip flexors, such as swimming.</text><text>For a severe strain, you may want to see a physical therapist (PT). The PT will work with you to:</text><detail>Stretch and strengthen your hip flexor muscles and other muscles that surround and support that area.</detail><detail>Guide you in increasing your activity level so you can return to your activities. </detail></h2><h2 title="Self-care at Home"><text>Follow your provider's recommendations for rest, ice, and pain relief medicines. If you are seeing a PT, be sure to do the exercises as directed. Following a care plan will help your muscles heal and likely prevent future injury.</text></h2><h2 title="When to Call the Doctor"><text>Call your provider if you do not feel better in a few weeks with treatment.</text></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>Pulled hip flexor - aftercare; Hip flexor injury - aftercare; Hip flexor tear - aftercare; Iliopsoas strain - aftercare; Strained iliopsoas muscle - aftercare; Torn iliopsoas muscle - aftercare; Psoas strain - aftercare</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 4/18/2017"><text>Updated by: C.

The most effective treatments for depression are:</text><detail>Talk therapy</detail><detail>Antidepressant medicines </detail><text>If your teen might have a problem with drugs or alcohol, discuss this with the provider.</text><text>If your teen has severe depression or is at risk for suicide, your teen may need to stay in the hospital for treatment. </text></h2><h2 title="Find a Good Therapist or Counselor"><text>Talk to your provider about finding a therapist for your teen.</text><detail>Most teens with depression benefit from some type of talk therapy.</detail><detail>Talk therapy is a good place to talk about their feelings and concerns, and to learn ways to deal with them. Your teen can learn to understand issues that may be causing their behavior, thoughts, or feelings.</detail><detail>Your teen will likely need to see a therapist at least once a week to start. </detail><text>There are many different kinds of talk therapy, such as:</text><detail>Cognitive-behavioral therapy teaches your teen to reason through negative thoughts. Your teen will be more aware of their symptoms, and will learn what makes their depression worse and problem-solving skills.</detail><detail>Family therapy is helpful when family conflict is contributing to the depression.

Medicine is more important if your teen is severely depressed. In these cases, talk therapy alone won't be effective.</text><text>If you decide that medicine would help, your provider will most likely prescribe a type of anti-depressant medicine called a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) for your teen.</text><text>The two most common SSRI medicines are fluoxetine (Prozac) and escitalopram (Lexapro). These are approved to treat depression in teenagers. Prozac is also approved for children age 8 and older.</text><text>Another type of antidepressants, called tricyclics, is not approved for use in teens.</text><text>There are risks and side effects with taking antidepressants. Your teen's provider can help manage these side effects. In a small number of teens, these medicines can make them more depressed and give them more suicidal thoughts.

Get medical help for these symptoms right away.</detail><detail>Your teen does not stop taking the antidepressant on their own. Talk to your teen's provider first. If your teen decides to stop taking the antidepressant, your teen may be instructed to lower the dose slowly before stopping altogether.</detail><detail>Keep your teen going to talk therapy.</detail><detail>If your teen is depressed in the fall or winter, ask your doctor about light therapy. It uses a special lamp that acts like the sun and may help with depression. </detail></h2><h2 title="You Can Help Your Teenager"><text>Keep talking with your teen.</text><detail>Give them your support.

Try not to overwhelm your teen with questions or lectures. Teens often shut down with that kind of approach. </detail><text>Help or support your teen with daily routines. You can:</text><detail>Schedule your family life to help your teen get enough sleep.</detail><detail>Create a healthy diet for your family.</detail><detail>Give gentle reminders for your teen to take their medicine.</detail><detail>Watch for signs that depression is getting worse.

<item><title>Helping your child understand a cancer diagnosis</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000844.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>Learning that your child has cancer can feel overwhelming and scary. You want to protect your child, not only from the cancer, but also from the fear that comes with having a serious illness. </text><text>Explaining what it means to have cancer will not be easy. Here are some things to know when talking with a child about having cancer.</text></h2><h2 title="Why Your Child Needs to Know"><text>It can be tempting NOT to tell children about cancer. Of course you want to protect your child from fear. But all children with cancer need to know that they have cancer. Most children will sense something is wrong and may make up their own stories about what it is. Children have a tendency to blame themselves for bad things happening. Being honest tends to lessen a child's stress, guilt, and confusion. </text><text>Also, many medical terms, including cancer, will be used by health care providers and others. Children need to understand why they are visiting with doctors and having tests and medicines. It also may help children explain their symptoms and discuss feelings. It will help build trust in your family.</text></h2><h2 title="When to Talk About the Cancer"><text>It is up to you when to tell your child about the cancer. Although it is tempting to put it off, you may find it is easiest to tell your child right away. It may become harder as time goes on. And it is best for your child to know and have time to ask questions before starting treatment.</text><text>If you are not sure when or how to bring it up, talk with your child's provider, such as a child life specialist. The provider may even help you give your child the news if it is too hard for you to do alone.</text></h2><h2 title="Tips for Talking About the Cancer"><text>Here are some things to keep in mind when talking about your child's cancer:</text><detail>Keep your child's age in mind. How much you share with your child depends on your child's age. For example, very young children may only need to know very basic information, while a teenager may want to know more details about treatments and side effects.</detail><detail>Encourage your child to ask questions. Try to answer them as honestly and openly as you can. If you do not know the answer, it is OK to say so.</detail><detail>Know your child may be afraid to ask some questions. Try to notice if your child has something on his mind but might be afraid to ask. For example, if your child seems upset after seeing other people who have lost their hair, talk about what symptoms he may have from treatment.</detail><detail>Keep in mind that your child may have heard things about cancer from other sources, such as TV, the movies, or other kids. It is a good idea to ask what he has heard, so you can make sure he has the right information.</detail><detail>Ask for help. Talking about cancer is not easy for anyone. If you need help with certain topics, ask your child's provider or cancer care team. </detail></h2><h2 title="Dealing With Common Fears"><text>There are some common fears that many children have when they learn about cancer. Your child may be too scared to tell you about these fears, so it is a good idea to bring them up yourself.</text><detail>Your child caused the cancer. It is common for younger children to think that they caused the cancer by doing something bad. It is important to let your child know that nothing she did caused the cancer.</detail><detail>Cancer is contagious. Many children think that cancer can spread from person to person. Make sure to let your child know that you cannot "catch" cancer from someone else.</detail><detail>Everyone dies from cancer. You can explain that cancer is a serious illness, but millions of people survive cancer with modern treatments. If your child knows someone who has died of cancer, let her know that there are many kinds of cancer and everyone's cancer is different. </detail><text>You may need to repeat these points many times during your child's treatment.</text></h2><h2 title="Ways to Help Your Child Cope"><text>Here are some ways to help your child cope during cancer treatment:</text><detail>Try to stay on a normal schedule. Schedules are comforting to kids. Try to keep as normal a schedule as you can.</detail><detail>Help your child stay in touch with classmates and friends. Some ways to do this include email, cards, texting, video games, and phone calls.</detail><detail>Keep up with any missed class work. This can help keep your child connected to the school and lessen any anxiety about falling behind.</detail><detail>Find ways to add humor to your child's day. Watch a funny TV show or movie together, or buy your child some comic books.</detail><detail>Visit with other children who have had cancer. Ask your doctor to put you in touch with other families who have successfully coped with cancer.</detail><detail>Let your child know it is OK to feel angry or sad. Help your child talk about these feelings with you or someone else.</detail><detail>Make sure your child has some fun every day.

You may not be sure it really is a drinking problem. Or, you might be afraid that your loved one will get angry or upset if you say something.</text><text>If you are concerned, DO NOT wait to bring it up. The problem is likely to get worse, not better, if you wait.</text></h2><h2 title="When is Drinking a Problem?"><text>Drinking problems are not measured by the amount someone drinks or how often they drink. What matters the most is how drinking affects the person's life. Your loved one may have a drinking problem if they:</text><detail>Regularly drink more than they intended</detail><detail>Cannot cut back on drinking</detail><detail>Spend a lot of time getting alcohol, drinking alcohol, or recovering from the effects of alcohol</detail><detail>Have trouble at work, home, or school because of alcohol use</detail><detail>Have trouble with relationships because of drinking</detail><detail>Miss important work, school, or social activities because of alcohol use </detail></h2><h2 title="Learn About Alcohol Use"><text>Start by learning all you can about alcohol use. You can read books, look online, or ask your health care provider for information. The more you know, the more information you'll have ready to help your loved one. </text></h2><h2 title="Get Support for Yourself"><text>Alcohol use takes a toll on everyone. You can't help your loved one if you don't take care of yourself and get support.</text><detail>Make your family's health and safety your top priority.</detail><detail>Ask other family members or friends for support. Be honest about your feelings and tell them what they can do to help.</detail><detail>Consider joining a group that supports family and friends of people with alcohol problems, such as Al-Anon. In these groups, you can talk openly about your struggles and learn from people who have been in your situation.</detail><detail>Consider seeking help from a counselor or therapist who deals with alcohol problems. Even though your loved one may be the drinker, drinking affects the entire family. </detail></h2><h2 title="What Not to Do"><text>It is not easy to be involved with a person who has a drinking problem. It takes a lot of patience and love. You also need to set certain boundaries for your own actions so you don't encourage the person's behavior or let it affect you.</text><detail>Don't lie or make excuses for your loved one's drinking.</detail><detail>Don't take on responsibilities for your loved one. This will only help the person avoid consequences for not doing the things they should.</detail><detail>Don't drink with your loved one.</detail><detail>Don't argue when your loved one has been drinking.</detail><detail>DO NOT feel guilty. You did not cause your loved one to drink, and you cannot control it.</detail></h2><h2 title="How to Talk About Alcohol Use"><text>It's not easy, but it's important to talk with your loved one about the drinking. Find a time to talk when the person is not drinking.</text><text>These tips may help make the conversation go more smoothly:</text><detail>Express your feelings about your loved one's drinking. Try to use "I" statements. This helps keep the focus on how the drinking affects you.</detail><detail>Try to stick with the facts about your loved one's alcohol use, such as specific behaviors that have you worried.</detail><detail>Explain that you're concerned for your loved one's health.</detail><detail>Try not to use labels like "alcoholic" when talking about the problem.</detail><detail>Don't preach or lecture.</detail><detail>Don't try to use guilt or bribe the person to stop drinking.</detail><detail>Don't threaten or plead.</detail><detail>Don't expect your loved one to get better without help.</detail><detail>Offer to go with the person to see a doctor or addiction counselor.</detail><text>Remember, you can't force your loved one to get help, but you can offer your support.</text></h2><h2 title="Getting Help"><text>It may take a few tries and several conversations before your loved one agrees to get help. There are many places to get help for an alcohol problem. You can start with your family provider. The provider may recommend an addiction treatment program or specialist. You can also check with your local hospital, insurance plan, or employee assistance program (EAP).</text><text>You can play an important role by continuing to show your support. Offer to go with your loved one to doctor appointments or meetings. Ask what else you can do, such as not drinking when you are together and keeping alcohol out of the house.</text></h2><h2 title="When to Call Your Doctor"><text>If you feel that your relationship with this person is becoming dangerous or is threatening your health, get help for yourself right away.

Whatever the cause, starting down the road to adulthood has its own special challenges.</text><text>You can help your teen by learning to recognize the signs of stress and teaching your child healthy ways to deal with it.</text></h2><h2 title="Causes of Teen Stress"><text>Common sources of stress in teens include:</text><detail>Worrying about schoolwork or grades</detail><detail>Juggling responsibilities, such as school and work or sports</detail><detail>Having problems with friends, bullying, or peer group pressures</detail><detail>Becoming sexually active or feeling pressure to do so</detail><detail>Changing schools, moving, or dealing with housing problems or homelessness</detail><detail>Having negative thoughts about themselves</detail><detail>Going through body changes, in both boys and girls</detail><detail>Seeing their parents go through a divorce or separation</detail><detail>Having financial problems in the family</detail><detail>Living in an unsafe home or neighborhood</detail><detail>Figuring out what to do after high school</detail><detail>Getting into college </detail></h2><h2 title="Learn to Recognize Stress"><text>Learn to recognize signs of stress in your teen. Take notice if your child:</text><detail>Acts angry or irritable</detail><detail>Cries often or seems teary</detail><detail>Withdraws from activities and people</detail><detail>Has trouble sleeping or sleeps too much</detail><detail>Seems overly worried</detail><detail>Eats too much or not enough</detail><detail>Complains of headaches or stomachaches</detail><detail>Seems tired or has no energy</detail><detail>Uses drugs or alcohol</detail></h2><h2 title="Learn to Recognize More Serious Mental Health Disorders"><text>Learn the signs of more serious mental health problems so you can get help for your child:</text><detail>Signs of teen depression</detail><detail>Signs of anxiety disorder</detail></h2><h2 title="How you can Help"><text>If you think your teen is under too much stress, you can help your child learn to manage it. Here are some tips:</text><detail>Spend time together. Try to spend some time alone with your teen each week. Even if your teen does not accept, they will notice that you offered. Get involved by managing or coaching their sports team, or by taking part in school activities. Or, simply attend games, concerts, or plays he or she is involved with.</detail><detail>Learn to listen. Listen openly to your teen's concerns and feelings, and share positive thoughts. Ask questions, but DO NOT interpret or jump in with advice unless you are asked. This type of open communication may make your teen more willing to discuss their stress with you.</detail><detail>Be a role model. Whether you know it or not, your teen looks to you as a model for healthy behavior. Do your best to keep your own stress under control and manage it in healthy ways.</detail><detail>Get your teen moving. Getting regular exercise is one of the best ways to beat stress, for both adults and teens. Encourage your teens to find an exercise they enjoy, whether it is team sports or other activities like yoga, wall climbing, swimming, dancing, or hiking. You might even suggest trying a new activity together.</detail><detail>Keep an eye on sleep. Teens need plenty of shut-eye. Not getting enough sleep makes it harder to manage stress. Try to make sure your teen gets at least 8 hours of sleep a night. This can be a challenge between school hours and homework. One way to help is by limiting screen time, both TV and computer, in the evening before bed.</detail><detail>Teach work management skills. Teach your teen some basic ways to manage tasks, such as making lists or breaking larger tasks into smaller ones and doing one piece at a time.</detail><detail>DO NOT try to solve your teenager's problems. As a parent, it is hard to see your child under stress. But try to resist solving your teen's problems. Instead, work together to brainstorm solutions and let your teen come up with ideas. Using this approach helps teens learn to tackle stressful situations on their own.</detail><detail>Stock up on healthy foods. Like many adults, teens often reach for unhealthy snacks when they are under stress. To help them resist the urge, fill your fridge and cabinets with veggies, fruits, whole grains, and lean proteins. Skip the sodas and high-calorie, sugary snacks.</detail><detail>Create family rituals. Family routines can be comforting for your teen during stressful times. Having a family dinner or movie night can help relieve the stress of the day and give you a chance to connect.</detail><detail>DO NOT demand perfection. None of us does everything perfectly. Expecting perfection from your teen is unrealistic and just adds stress. </detail></h2><h2 title="When to Call a Medical Professional"><text>Call your health care provider if your teen seems: </text><detail>Overwhelmed by stress</detail><detail>Talks about self-harm</detail><detail>Mentions thoughts of suicide</detail><text>Also call if you notice signs of depression or anxiety. </text></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>Adolescents - stress; Anxiety - cope with stress </text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 8/3/2018"><text>Updated by: Linda J.

<item><title>Heel pain and Achilles tendonitis - aftercare</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000836.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>When you overuse the Achilles tendon, it can become swollen and painful near the bottom of the foot and cause heel pain. This is called Achilles tendonitis.</text></h2><h2 title="More About Your Injury"><text>The Achilles tendon connects your calf muscles to your heel bone. Together, they help you push your heel off the ground when you stand up on your toes. You use these muscles and your Achilles tendon when you walk, run, and jump. </text><text>Heel pain is most often due to overuse of the foot. It is rarely caused by an injury.</text><text>Tendonitis due to overuse is most common in younger people. It can occur in walkers, runners, or other athletes.</text><text>Tendonitis from arthritis is more common in middle aged or older adults. A bone spur or growth may form in the back of the heel bone. This may irritate the Achilles tendon and causes pain and swelling.</text></h2><h2 title="What To Expect"><text>You might feel pain in the heel along the length of the tendon when walking or running. Your pain and stiffness might increase in the morning. The tendon may be painful to touch. The area may be warm and swollen.</text><text>You might also have trouble standing up on one toe and moving the foot up and down.</text><text>Your health care provider will examine your foot. You may have an X-ray or an MRI to check for problems with your bones or with your Achilles tendon.</text></h2><h2 title="Self-care at Home"><text>Follow these steps to relieve symptoms and help your injury heal:</text><detail>Apply ice over the Achilles tendon for 15 to 20 minutes, 2 to 3 times per day. Use an ice pack wrapped in a cloth. DO NOT apply ice directly to skin.</detail><detail>Take painkillers, such as aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil or Motrin), or naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn) to decrease inflammation and pain.</detail><detail>Wear a walking boot or heel lifts if recommended by your provider. </detail><text>Talk with your provider before using pain medicines if you have heart disease, high blood pressure, kidney disease, or have had stomach ulcers or internal bleeding in the past. DO NOT take more than the amount recommended on the bottle or by your provider.</text></h2><h2 title="Activity"><text>To allow your tendon to heal, you should stop or decrease activities that cause pain, such as running or jumping.</text><detail>Do activities that do not strain the tendon, such as swimming or cycling.</detail><detail>When walking or running, choose soft, smooth surfaces. Avoid hills.</detail><detail>Gradually increase the amount of activity you do. </detail><text>Your provider may give you exercises to stretch and strengthen the muscles and tendon.</text><detail>Range of motion exercises will help you regain movement in all directions.</detail><detail>Do exercises gently. DO NOT over-stretch, which can injure your Achilles tendon.</detail><detail>Strengthening exercises will help prevent tendonitis from coming back.</detail></h2><h2 title="Follow up "><text>If your symptoms do not improve with self-care in 2 weeks, see your health care provider. If your injury does not heal with self-care, you may need to see a physical therapist.</text><text>Having tendonitis puts you at risk for an Achilles tendon rupture. You can help prevent further problems by keeping up with stretching and strengthening exercises to keep your foot flexible and strong. </text></h2><h2 title="When To Call the Doctor"><text>You should call your provider:</text><detail>If your symptoms do not improve or get worse</detail><detail>You notice a sharp pain in your ankle</detail><detail>You have trouble walking or standing on your foot </detail></h2><h2 title="Review Date 8/26/2017"><text>Updated by: Linda J.

<item><title>Heart pacemaker - discharge</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000097.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>A pacemaker is a small, battery-operated device that senses when your heart is beating irregularly or too slowly. It sends a signal to your heart that makes your heart beat at the correct pace. This article discusses what you need to do to take care of yourself when you leave the hospital.</text></h2><h2 title="When You're in the Hospital"><text>You had a pacemaker placed in your chest to help your heart beat properly.</text><detail>A small cut was made on your chest below your collarbone. The pacemaker generator was then placed under the skin at this location.</detail><detail>Leads (wires) were connected to the pacemaker, and one end of the wires was threaded through a vein into your heart. The skin over the area where the pacemaker was placed was closed with stitches. </detail><text>Most pacemakers have only one or two wires that go to the heart. These wires stimulate one or more of the chambers of the heart to squeeze (contract) when the heartbeat gets too slow. A special type of pacemaker can be used for patients with heart failure. It has three leads to help the heart beat in a more coordinated manner.</text><picname>Pacemaker</picname><picurl>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/images/ency/fullsize/23220.jpg</picurl><text>Some pacemakers also can deliver electric shocks to the heart that can stop life-threatening arrhythmias (irregular heartbeats). These are called "cardioverter defibrillators."</text><text>You should know what type of pacemaker you have and what company made it.</text></h2><h2 title="What to Expect at Home"><text>You will be given a card to keep in your wallet.</text><detail>The card has information about your pacemaker and includes your doctor's name and telephone number. It also tells others what to do in case of an emergency.</detail><detail>You should always carry this wallet card with you. It will be helpful to any health care provider that you may see in the future because it says what kind of pacemaker you have. </detail><text>You should wear a medic alert bracelet or necklace that says you have a pacemaker. In a medical emergency, health care workers taking care of you should know you have a pacemaker.</text></h2><h2 title="Be Careful Around Things With Magnets "><text>Most machines and devices will not interfere with your pacemaker. But some with strong magnetic fields may. Always ask your provider about any specific device that you need to avoid. DO NOT put a magnet near your pacemaker.</text><text>Most appliances in your home are safe to be around. This includes your refrigerator, washer, dryer, toaster, blender, computers and fax machines, hair dryer, stove, CD player, remote controls, and microwaves.</text><text>You should keep several devices at least 12 inches (30 centimeters) away from the site where the pacemaker is placed under your skin.

DO NOT lean over the open hood of a car that is running. Also stay away from:</text><detail>Radio transmitters and high-voltage power lines</detail><detail>Products that use magnetic therapy, such as some mattresses, pillows, and massagers</detail><detail>Large electrical- or gasoline-powered appliances </detail><text>If you have a cell phone:</text><detail>DO NOT put it in a pocket on the same side of your body as your pacemaker.</detail><detail>When using your cell phone, hold it to your ear on the opposite side of your body. </detail><text>Be careful around metal detectors and security wands.</text><detail>Handheld security wands may interfere with your pacemaker. Show your wallet card and ask to be hand searched.</detail><detail>Most security gates at airports and stores are OK. But DO NOT stand near these devices for long periods. Your pacemaker may set off alarms. </detail><text>After any operation, have your provider check your pacemaker.</text></h2><h2 title="Wound Care "><text>You should be able to do normal activities in 3 to 4 days.</text><text>For 2 to 3 weeks, DO NOT do these things with the arm on the side of your body where the pacemaker was placed:</text><detail>Lifting anything heavier than 10 to 15 pounds (4.5 to 7 kilograms)</detail><detail>Too much pushing, pulling, or twisting </detail><text>DO NOT lift this arm above your shoulder for several weeks. DO NOT wear clothes that rub on the wound for 2 or 3 weeks. Keep your incision completely dry for 4 to 5 days. Afterward, you may take a shower and then pat it dry. Always wash your hands before touching the wound.</text></h2><h2 title="Follow-up "><text>Your provider will tell you how often you will need to have your pacemaker checked. In most cases, it will be every 6 months to a year. The exam will take about 15 to 30 minutes.</text><text>The batteries in your pacemaker should last 6 to 15 years.

A nurse will go over your child's home results with you in a regular phone call.</text><text>Throughout the day, watch for these signs or symptoms in your child:</text><detail>Low energy level</detail><detail>Shortness of breath when doing everyday activities</detail><detail>Clothes or shoes that feel tight</detail><detail>Swelling in the ankles or legs</detail><detail>Coughing more often or a wet cough</detail><detail>Shortness of breath at night </detail><text>Weighing your child will help you know if there is too much fluid in their body. You should:</text><detail>Weigh your child every morning on the same scale upon awakening. Before they eat and after they use the bathroom. Make sure your child wears similar clothing each time.</detail><detail>Ask your child's provider what range their weight should stay within.</detail><detail>Also call the provider if your child loses a lot of weight. </detail></h2><h2 title="Feeding and Nutrition"><text>Babies and infants' bodies are working extra hard because of heart failure. Infants may be too tired to drink enough breast milk or formula when feeding. So they often need extra calories to help them grow. Your child's provider may suggest a formula that has more calories packed into every ounce. You may need to keep track of how much formula is taken, and report when your child has diarrhea. Babies and infants will also need extra nutrition through a feeding tube. </text><text>Older children also may not eat enough due to a decrease in appetite. Even older children may require a feeding tube, either all of the time, just part of the day, or when weight loss occurs.</text><text>When more severe heart failure is present, your child may need to limit the amount of salt and total fluids taken in every day.</text></h2><h2 title="Other Self-care Tips"><text>Your child will need to take medicines to treat heart failure. Medicines treat the symptoms and prevent heart failure from getting worse. It is very important that your child take the medicine as directed by the health care team. </text><text>These medicines: </text><detail>Help the heart muscle pump better</detail><detail>Keep blood from clotting</detail><detail>Open up blood vessels or slow the heart rate so the heart does not have to work as hard</detail><detail>Reduce damage to the heart</detail><detail>Reduce the risk of abnormal heart rhythms</detail><detail>Replace potassium</detail><detail>Rid the body of excess fluid and salt (sodium) </detail><text>Your child should take heart failure medicines as directed. DO NOT allow your child to take any other drugs or herbs without first asking your child's provider about them. Common drugs that may make heart failure worse include: </text><detail>Ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin)</detail><detail>Naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn) </detail><text>If your child requires oxygen at home, you will need to know how to store and use oxygen. If you are traveling, plan ahead. You will also need to learn about oxygen safety in the home.</text><text>Some children may need to limit or restrict certain activities or sports. Be sure to discuss this with the provider. </text></h2><h2 title="When to Call the Doctor"><text>Call your child's provider if your child:</text><detail>Is tired or weak.</detail><detail>Feels short of breath when active or at rest.</detail><detail>Has a bluish skin color around the mouth or on the lips and tongue.</detail><detail>Is wheezing and having trouble breathing. This is seen more in infants.</detail><detail>Has a cough that does not go away. It may be dry and hacking, or it may sound wet and bring up pink, foamy spit.</detail><detail>Has swelling in the feet, ankles, or legs.</detail><detail>Has gained or lost weight.</detail><detail>Has pain and tenderness in the belly.</detail><detail>Has a very slow or very fast pulse or heartbeat, or it is not regular.</detail><detail>Has blood pressure that is lower or higher than is normal for your child. </detail></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>Congestive heart failure (CHF) - home monitoring for children; Cor pulmonale - home monitoring for children; Cardiomyopathy - heart failure home monitoring for children</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 10/4/2016"><text>Updated by: Scott I Aydin, MD, Assistant Professor of Pediatrics, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Division of Pediatric Cardiology and Critical Care Medicine, The Children's Hospital at Montefiore, Bronx, NY.

<item><title>Heart failure - tests</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000366.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>The diagnosis of heart failure is made largely on a person's symptoms and a physical exam. However, there are many tests that can help give more information about the condition.</text></h2><h2 title="Echocardiogram"><text>An echocardiogram (echo) is a test that uses sound waves to create a moving picture of the heart. The picture is much more detailed than a plain x-ray image.</text><text>This test helps your health care provider learn more about how well your heart contracts and relaxes. It also provides information about the size of your heart and how well the heart valves are working.</text><text>An echocardiogram is the best test to:</text><detail>Identify which type of heart failure (systolic, diastolic, valvular)</detail><detail>Monitor your heart failure and guide your treatment </detail><text>Heart failure can be diagnosed if the echocardiogram shows that the pumping function of the heart is too low. This is called an ejection fraction. A normal ejection fraction is around 55% to 65%.</text><text>If only some parts of the heart are not working correctly, it may mean that there is a blockage in the artery of the heart that delivers blood to that area.</text></h2><h2 title="Other Imaging Tests"><text>Many other imaging tests are used to look at how well your heart is able to pump blood and the extent of heart muscle damage.</text><text>You may have a chest x-ray done in your provider's office if your symptoms suddenly become worse. However, a chest x-ray cannot diagnose heart failure.</text><text>Ventriculography is another test that measures the overall squeezing strength of the heart (ejection fraction). Like an echocardiogram, it can show parts of the heart muscle that are not moving well. This test uses x-ray contrast fluid to fill the pumping chamber of the heart and evaluate its function. It is often done at the same time as other tests, such as coronary angiography.</text><text>MRI, CT, or PET scans of the heart may be done to check how much heart muscle damage is present. It can also help detect the reason for a patient's heart failure.</text><text>Stress tests are done to see whether the heart muscle is getting enough blood flow and oxygen when it is working hard (under stress). Types of stress tests include:</text><detail>Nuclear stress test</detail><detail>Exercise stress test</detail><detail>Stress echocardiogram</detail><text>Your provider may order a heart catheterization if any imaging tests show that you have narrowing in one of your arteries, or if you are having chest pain (angina).</text></h2><h2 title="Blood Tests"><text>Several different blood tests can be used to learn more about your condition. Tests are done to:</text><detail>Help diagnose the cause for and monitor heart failure.</detail><detail>Identify risk factors for heart disease.</detail><detail>Look for possible causes of heart failure or problems that may make your heart failure worse.</detail><detail>Monitor side effects of medications you may be taking. </detail><text>Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and serum creatinine tests help monitor how well your kidneys are working. You will need these tests regularly if: </text><detail>You are taking medicines called ACE inhibitors or ARBs (angiotensin receptor blockers)</detail><detail>Your provider makes changes to the doses of your medicines</detail><detail>You have more severe heart failure </detail><text>Sodium and potassium levels in your blood will need to be measured on a regular basis when there are changes made for some medicines including:</text><detail>ACE inhibitors, ARBs, or certain types of water pills (amiloride, spironolactone, and triamterene) that can make your potassium levels too high</detail><detail>Most other types of water pills, which can make your sodium too low or your potassium too high </detail><text>Anemia, or low red blood cell count, can make your heart failure worse.

<item><title>Heart failure - surgeries and devices</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000363.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>The main treatments for heart failure are making lifestyle changes and taking your medicines. However, there are procedures and surgeries that may help.</text></h2><h2 title="Pacemakers and Defibrillators"><text>A heart pacemaker is a small, battery-operated device that sends a signal to your heart. The signal makes your heart beat at the correct pace.</text><picname>Pacemaker</picname><picurl>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/images/ency/fullsize/19566.jpg</picurl><text>Pacemakers may be used:</text><detail>To correct abnormal heart rhythms. The heart may beat too slowly, too fast, or in an irregular manner.</detail><detail>To better coordinate the beating of the heart in people with heart failure. These are called biventricular pacemakers. </detail><text>When your heart is weakened, gets too large, and does not pump blood very well, you are at high risk for abnormal heartbeats that can lead to sudden cardiac death.</text><detail>An implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) is a device that detects heart rhythms. It quickly sends an electrical shock to the heart to change the rhythm back to normal.</detail><detail>Most biventricular pacemakers can also work as implantable cardio-defibrillators (ICD). </detail></h2><h2 title="Procedures and Surgery to Improve Blood Supply to the Heart"><text>The most common cause of heart failure is coronary artery disease (CAD), which is a narrowing of the small blood vessels that supply blood and oxygen to the heart. CAD may become worse and make it harder to manage your symptoms.</text>Watch this video about:Coronary artery disease<text>After performing certain tests your health care provider may feel that opening a narrowed or blocked blood vessel will improve your heart failure symptoms. Suggested procedures may include:</text><detail>Angioplasty and stent placement</detail><detail>Heart bypass surgery</detail></h2><h2 title="Heart Valve Surgery"><text>Blood that flows between the chambers of your heart, or out of your heart into the aorta, must pass through a heart valve. These valves open enough to allow blood to flow through. They then close, keeping blood from flowing backward.</text><text>When these valves do not work well (become too leaky or too narrow), blood does not flow correctly through the heart to the body. This problem may cause heart failure or make heart failure worse.</text><text>Heart valve surgery may be needed to repair or replace one of the valves.</text></h2><h2 title="Surgery for End-stage Heart Failure"><text>Some types of surgery are done for severe heart failure when other treatments no longer work. These procedures are often used when a person is waiting for a heart transplant. They are also sometimes used long term in cases when transplant is not planned or possible.</text><text>Examples of some of these devices include left ventricular assist device (LVAD), right ventricular assist devices (RVAD) or a total artificial hearts. They are considered for use if you have severe heart failure that cannot be controlled with medicine or a special pacemaker.</text><detail>Ventricular assist devices (VAD) help your heart pump blood from the pumping chambers of your heart to either the lungs or to the rest of your body These pumps may be implanted in your body or connected to a pump outside your body.</detail><detail>You may be on a waiting list for a heart transplant. Some patients who get a VAD are very ill and may already be on a heart-lung bypass machine.</detail><detail>Total artificial hearts are being developed, but are not yet in wide use. </detail><text>Devices inserted thru a catheter such as intra-aortic balloon pumps (IABP) are sometimes used.</text><detail>An IABP is a thin balloon that is inserted into an artery (most often in the leg) and threaded into the main artery exiting the heart (aorta). </detail><detail>These devices can help maintain heart function in the short term. Because they can be placed quickly, they are useful for patients who have a sudden and severe decline in heart function </detail><detail>They are used in people who are waiting for recovery or for more advanced assist devices. </detail></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>CHF - surgery; Congestive heart failure - surgery; Cardiomyopathy - surgery; HF - surgery; Intra-aortic balloon pumps - heart failure; IABP - heart failure; Catheter based assist devices - heart failure</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 4/16/2017"><text>Updated by: Michael A.

<item><title>Heart failure - palliative care</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000365.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>It is important to talk to your health care providers and your family about the kind of end-of-life care you want when you are being treated for heart failure.</text></h2><h2 title="Making Some Decisions"><text>Chronic heart failure very often gets worse over time. Many people who have heart failure die of the condition. It can be hard to think and talk about the type of care you want at the end of your life. However, discussing these subjects with your doctors and loved ones may help bring you peace of mind.</text><text>You may have already discussed heart transplantation and the use of a ventricular assist device with your doctor.</text><text>At some point, you will be faced with the decision about whether to continue active or aggressive treatment of heart failure. Then, you may want to discuss the option of palliative or comfort care with your providers and loved ones.</text><text>Many people wish to stay in their homes during the end of life period. This is often possible with the support of loved ones, caregivers, and a hospice program. You may need to make changes in your home to make life easier and keep you safe. Hospice units in hospitals and other nursing facilities are also an option.</text><text>Advance care directives are documents that state the type of care you would like to have if you are unable to speak for yourself.</text></h2><h2 title="Fatigue and Breathlessness"><text>Fatigue and breathlessness are common problems at the end of life. These symptoms can be distressing.</text><text>You may feel short of breath and have trouble breathing. Other symptoms may include tightness in the chest, feeling as if you are not getting enough air, or even feeling like you're being smothered.</text><text>Family or caregivers can help by:</text><detail>Encouraging the person to sit upright</detail><detail>Increasing the airflow in a room by using a fan or opening a window</detail><detail>Helping the person relax and not panic </detail><text>Using oxygen will help you combat shortness of breath and keep a person with end-stage heart failure comfortable. Safety measures (such as not smoking) are very important when using oxygen at home.</text><text>Morphine can also help shortness of breath. It is available as a pill, liquid, or tablet that dissolves under the tongue. Your provider will tell you how to take morphine.</text></h2><h2 title="Eating and Digestive Symptoms"><text>Symptoms of fatigue, shortness of breath, loss of appetite, and nausea can make it hard for people with heart failure to take in enough calories and nutrients. Wasting of muscles and weight loss are part of the natural disease process.</text><text>It can help to eat several small meals. Choosing foods that are appealing and easy to digest can make it easier to eat.</text><text>Caregivers should not try to force a person with heart failure to eat. This does not help the person live longer and may be uncomfortable.</text><text>Talk to your provider about things you can do to help manage nausea or vomiting and constipation.</text></h2><h2 title="Other Symptoms"><text>Anxiety, fear, and sadness are common among people with end-stage heart failure.</text><detail>Family and caregivers should look for signs of these problems. Asking the person about his or her feelings and fears can make it easier to discuss them.</detail><detail>Morphine can also help with fearfulness and anxiety. Certain antidepressants may also be useful. </detail><text>Pain is a common problem in the end stages of many diseases, including heart failure. Morphine and other pain medicines can help. Common over-the-counter pain medicines, such as ibuprofen, are often not safe for people with heart failure.</text><text>Some people may have problems with bladder control or bowel function. Talk with your provider before using any medicines, laxatives, or suppositories for these symptoms.</text></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>CHF - palliative; Congestive heart failure - palliative; Cardiomyopathy - palliative; HF - palliative; Cardiac cachexia; End-of-life-heart failure</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 4/16/2017"><text>Updated by: Michael A.

<item><title>Heart failure - medicines</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000364.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>Most people who have heart failure need to take medicines. Some of these medicines are used to treat your symptoms. Others may help prevent your heart failure from becoming worse and let you live longer.</text></h2><h2 title="How to Take Your Medicines"><text>You will need to take most of your heart failure medicines every day. Some medicines are taken once a day. Others need to be taken 2 or more times daily. It is very important that you take your medicines at the right time and in the way your doctor has told you.</text><text>Never stop taking your heart medicines without talking to your health care provider first. This is also true for other medicines you take, such as drugs for diabetes, high blood pressure, and other serious conditions.</text><text>Your provider may also tell you to take certain medicines or change your doses when your symptoms get worse. DO NOT change your medicines or doses without talking to provider.</text><text>Always tell your provider before you take any new medicines. This includes over-the-counter medicines such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) and naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn), as well as drugs such as Sildenafil (Viagra), vardenafil (Levitra), and tadalafil (Cialis).</text><text>Also tell your provider before you take any type of herb or supplement.</text></h2><h2 title="ACE Inhibitors and ARBs"><text>ACE inhibitors (angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors) and ARBs (angiotensin II receptor blockers) work by opening blood vessels and lowering blood pressure. These medicines can:</text><detail>Reduce the work your heart has to do</detail><detail>Help your heart muscle pump better</detail><detail>Keep your heart failure from getting worse </detail><text>Common side effects of these drugs include:</text><detail>Dry cough</detail><detail>Lightheadedness</detail><detail>Fatigue</detail><detail>Upset stomach</detail><detail>Edema</detail><detail>Headache</detail><detail>Diarrhea </detail><text>When you take these medicines, you will need to have blood tests to check how well your kidneys are working and to measure your potassium levels.</text><text>Most of the time, your provider will prescribe either an ACE inhibitor or an ARB. A new drug class called angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitors (ARNI's) combines an ARB drug with a new type of drug. ARNI's may be used to treat heart failure.</text></h2><h2 title="Beta Blockers"><text>Beta blockers slow your heart rate and decrease the strength with which your heart muscle contracts in the short term. Long term beta blockers help keep your heart failure from becoming worse. Over time they may also help strengthen your heart.</text><text>Common beta blockers used for heart failure include carvedilol (Coreg), bisoprolol (Zebeta), and metoprolol (Toprol).</text><text>DO NOT abruptly stop taking these drugs. This can increase the risk of angina and even a heart attack. Other side effects include lightheadedness, depression, fatigue, and memory loss.</text></h2><h2 title="Water Pills or Diuretics"><text>Diuretics help your body get rid of extra fluid. Some types of diuretics may also help in other ways. These drugs are often called "water pills." There are many brands of diuretics. Some are taken once a day. Others are taken 2 times a day. The most common types are:</text><detail>Thiazides. Chlorothiazide (Diuril), chlorthalidone (Hygroton), indapamide (Lozol), hydrochlorothiazide (Esidrix, HydroDiuril), and metolazone (Mykrox, Zaroxolyn)</detail><detail>Loop diuretics. Bumentanide (Bumex), furosemide (Lasix), and torasemide (Demadex)</detail><detail>Potassium-sparing agents. Amiloride (Midamor), spironolactone (Aldactone), and triamterene (Dyrenium) </detail><text>When you take these medicines, you will need regular blood tests to check how well your kidneys are working and measure your potassium levels.</text></h2><h2 title="Other Drugs for Heart Failure"><text>Many people with heart disease take either aspirin or clopidogrel (Plavix). These drugs help prevent blood clots from forming in your arteries. This can lower your risk of a stroke or heart attack.</text><text>Coumadin (Warfarin) is recommended for patients with heart failure who have a higher risk for blood clots. You will need to have extra blood tests to make sure your dose is correct. You may also need to make changes to your diet.</text><text>Drugs used less commonly for heart failure include:</text><detail>Digoxin to help increase the heart's pumping strength and slow the heart rate.</detail><detail>Hydralazine and nitrates to open up arteries and help the heart muscle pump better. These drugs are mainly used by patients who are unable to tolerate ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers.</detail><detail>Calcium channel blockers to control blood pressure or angina (chest pain) from coronary artery disease (CAD). </detail><text>Statins and other cholesterol-lowering drugs are used when needed.</text><text>Antiarrhythmic medicines are sometimes used by heart failure patients who have abnormal heart rhythms. One such drug is amiodarone.</text><text>A new medicine, Ivabradine (Corlanor), acts to lower the heart rate and may help people with heart failure by reducing the hearts' workload. </text></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>CHF - medicines; Congestive heart failure - medicines; Cardiomyopathy - medicines; HF - medicines</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 4/16/2017"><text>Updated by: Michael A.

This causes fluids to build up in your body. If you drink too many fluids, you may get symptoms such as swelling, weight gain, and shortness of breath. Limiting how much you drink and how much salt (sodium) you take in can help prevent these symptoms.</text><text>Your family members can help you take care of yourself. They can keep an eye on how much you drink. They can make sure you are taking your medicines the right way. And they can learn to recognize your symptoms early.</text><text>Your health care provider may ask you to lower the amount of fluids you drink:</text><detail>When your heart failure is not very bad, you may not have to limit your fluids too much.</detail><detail>As your heart failure gets worse, you may need to limit fluids to 6 to 9 cups (1.5 to 2 liters) a day. </detail></h2><h2 title="Tips to Limit Fluids"><text>Remember, some foods, such as soups, puddings, gelatin, ice cream, popsicles and others contain fluids. When you eat chunky soups, use a fork if you can, and leave the broth behind.</text><text>Use a small cup at home for your liquids at meals, and drink just 1 cupful (240 mL). After drinking 1 cup (240 mL) of fluid at a restaurant, turn your cup over to let your server know you DO NOT want more. Find ways to keep from getting too thirsty:</text><detail>When you are thirsty, chew some gum, rinse your mouth with cold water and spit it out, or suck on something such as hard candy, a slice of lemon, or small pieces of ice.</detail><detail>Stay cool. Getting overheated will make you thirsty. </detail><text>If you have trouble keeping track of it, write down how much you are drinking during the day. </text><text>Eating too much salt can make you thirsty, which can make you drink too much. Extra salt also makes more fluid stay in your body. Many foods contain "hidden salt," including prepared, canned and frozen foods. Learn how to eat a low-salt diet. </text></h2><h2 title="Diuretics "><text>Diuretics help your body get rid of extra fluid. They are often called "water pills." There are many brands of diuretics. Some are taken 1 time a day. Others are taken 2 times a day. The three common types are:</text><detail>Thiazides: Chlorothiazide (Diuril), chlorthalidone (Hygroton), indapamide (Lozol), hydrochlorothiazide (Esidrix, HydroDiuril), and metolazone (Mykrox, Zaroxolyn)</detail><detail>Loop diuretics: Bumentanide (Bumex), furosemide (Lasix), and torasemide (Demadex)</detail><detail>Potassium-sparing agents: Amiloride (Midamor), spironolactone (Aldactone), and triamterene (Dyrenium) </detail><text>There are also diuretics that contain a combination of two of the drugs above.</text><text>When you are taking diuretics, you will need to have regular checkups so that your provider can check your potassium levels and monitor how your kidneys are working.</text><text>Diuretics make you urinate more often. Try not to take them at night before you go to bed. Take them at the same time every day.</text><text>Common side effects of diuretics are:</text><detail>Fatigue, muscle cramps, or weakness from low potassium levels</detail><detail>Dizziness or lightheadedness</detail><detail>Numbness or tingling</detail><detail>Heart palpitations, or a "fluttery" heartbeat</detail><detail>Gout</detail><detail>Depression</detail><detail>Irritability</detail><detail>Urinary incontinence (not being able to hold your urine)</detail><detail>Loss of sex drive (from potassium-sparing diuretics), or inability to have an erection</detail><detail>Hair growth, menstrual changes, and a deepening voice in women (from potassium-sparing diuretics)</detail><detail>Breast swelling in men or breast tenderness in women (from potassium-sparing diuretics)</detail><detail>Allergic reactions -- if you are allergic to sulfa drugs, you should not use thiazides. </detail><text>Be sure to take your diuretic the way you have been told.</text></h2><h2 title="Weighing Yourself Regularly "><text>You will get to know what weight is right for you. Weighing yourself will help you know if there is too much fluid in your body. You might also find that your clothes and shoes are feeling tighter than normal when there is too much fluid in your body.</text><text>Weigh yourself every morning on the same scale when you get up -- before you eat and after you use the bathroom. Make sure you are wearing similar clothing each time you weigh yourself. Write down your weight every day on a chart so that you can keep track of it.</text><text>Call your provider if your weight goes up by more than 2 to 3 pounds (1 to 1.5 kilograms, kg) in a day or 5 pounds (2 kg) in a week. Also call your provider if you lose a lot of weight.</text></h2><h2 title="When to Call the Doctor"><text>Call your provider if:</text><detail>You are tired or weak.</detail><detail>You feel short of breath when you are active or when you are at rest.</detail><detail>You feel short of breath when you lie down, or an hour or two after falling asleep.</detail><detail>You are wheezing and having trouble breathing.</detail><detail>You have a cough that does not go away. It may be dry and hacking, or it may sound wet and bring up pink, foamy spit.</detail><detail>You have swelling in your feet, ankles, or legs.</detail><detail>You have to urinate a lot, especially at night.</detail><detail>You have gained or lost weight.</detail><detail>You have pain and tenderness in your belly.</detail><detail>You have symptoms that you think might be from your medicines.</detail><detail>Your pulse, or heartbeat, gets very slow or very fast, or it is not steady. </detail></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>HF - fluids and diuretics; CHF - ICD discharge; Cardiomyopathy - ICD discharge</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 8/2/2016"><text>Updated by: Michael A.

When symptoms become severe, a hospital stay may be necessary. This articles discusses what you need to do to take care of yourself when you leave the hospital.</text></h2><h2 title="When you Were in the Hospital"><text>You were in the hospital to have your heart failure treated. Heart failure occurs when the muscles of your heart are weak or have trouble relaxing, or both.</text><text>Your heart is a pump that moves fluids through your body. As with any pump, if the flow out of the pump is not enough, fluids do not move well and they get stuck in places they should not be. In your body, this means that fluid collects in your lungs, abdomen, and legs.</text><text>While you were in the hospital:</text><detail>Your health care team closely adjusted the fluids you drank or received through an intravenous (IV) line. They also watched and measured how much urine you produced.</detail><detail>You may have received medicines to help your body get rid of extra fluids.</detail><detail>You may have had tests to check how well your heart was working. </detail></h2><h2 title="What to Expect at Home"><text>Your energy will slowly return. You may need help taking care of yourself when you first get home. You may feel sad or depressed. All of these things are normal.</text></h2><h2 title="Checking Yourself at Home"><text>Weigh yourself every morning on the same scale when you get up -- before you eat but after you use the bathroom. Make sure you are wearing similar clothing each time you weigh yourself. Write down your weight every day on a chart so that you can keep track of it. </text><text>Throughout the day, ask yourself:</text><detail>Is my energy level normal?</detail><detail>Do I get more short of breath when I am doing my everyday activities?</detail><detail>Are my clothes or shoes feeling tight?</detail><detail>Are my ankles or legs swelling?</detail><detail>Am I coughing more often? Does my cough sound wet?</detail><detail>Do I get short of breath at night or when I lie down?</detail><text>If you are having new (or different) symptoms, ask yourself:</text><detail>Did I eat something different than usual or try a new food?</detail><detail>Did I take all of my medicines the right way at the right times? </detail></h2><h2 title="Diet and Fluids"><text>Your health care provider may ask you to limit how much you drink.</text><detail>When your heart failure is not very severe, you may not have to limit your fluids too much.</detail><detail>As your heart failure gets worse, you may be asked to limit fluids to 6 to 9 cups (1.5 to 2 liters) a day. </detail><text>You will need to eat less salt. Salt can make you thirsty, and being thirsty can cause you to drink too much fluid. Extra salt also makes fluid stay in your body. Lots of foods that DO NOT taste salty, or that you DO NOT add salt to, still contain a lot of salt.</text><text>You may need to take a diuretic, or water pill.</text><text>DO NOT drink alcohol. Alcohol makes it harder for your heart muscles to work. Ask your provider what to do on special occasions where alcohol and foods you are trying to avoid will be served.</text><text>If you smoke, stop. Ask for help quitting if you need it. DO NOT let anybody smoke in your home.</text><text>Learn more about what you should eat to make your heart and blood vessels healthier.</text><detail>Avoid fatty foods.</detail><detail>Stay away from fast-food restaurants.</detail><detail>Avoid some prepared and frozen foods.</detail><detail>Learn fast food tips. </detail><text>Try to stay away from things that are stressful for you.

It is very important that you take your drugs the way your health care provider told you to. DO NOT take any other drugs or herbs without asking your provider about them first.</text><text>Take your drugs with water. DO NOT take them with grapefruit juice, since it may change how your body absorbs certain medicines. Ask your provider or pharmacist if this will be a problem for you.</text><text>The drugs below are given to many people who have heart failure. Sometimes there is a reason they may not be safe to take, though. These drugs may help protect your heart.

Never just stop taking these drugs for your heart, or any drugs you may be taking for Diabetes, high blood pressure, or other medical conditions you have.</text><text>If you are taking a blood thinner, such as warfarin (Coumadin), you will need to have extra blood tests to make sure your dose is correct.</text></h2><h2 title="Activity "><text>Your provider may refer you to cardiac rehabilitation program. There, you will learn how to slowly increase your exercise and how to take care of your heart disease.

The surgery is used to treat coronary heart disease. This articles discusses what you need to do to care for yourself when you leave the hospital.</text></h2><h2 title="When you Were in the Hospital"><text>Your surgeon took a vein or artery from another part of your body to create a detour, or bypass, around an artery that was blocked and could not bring enough blood to your heart.</text><text>Your surgery was done through an incision (cut) in your chest. If the surgeon went through your breastbone, the surgeon repaired it with wire and a metal plate, and your skin was closed with stitches. You also had an incision made in your leg or arm, where the vein was taken to be used for the bypass. </text></h2><h2 title="What to Expect at Home"><text>After surgery, it takes 4 to 6 weeks to completely heal and start feeling better.

<item><title>Hearing loss and music</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000495.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>Adults and children are commonly exposed to loud music. Listening to loud music through ear buds connected to devices like iPods or MP3 players or at music concerts can cause hearing loss.</text><text>The inner part of the ear contains tiny hair cells (nerve endings).</text><detail>The hair cells change sound into electric signals.</detail><detail>Nerves then carry these signals to the brain, which recognizes them as sound.</detail><detail>These tiny hair cells are easily damaged by loud sounds.</detail><text>The human ear is like any other body part -- too much use can damage it.</text><text>Over time, repeated exposure to loud noise and music can cause hearing loss.</text></h2><h2 title="Decibels of Sound and Hearing Loss"><text>The decibel (dB) is a unit to measure the level of sound.</text><detail>The softest sound that some humans can hear is 20 dB or lower.</detail><detail>Normal talking is 40 dB to 60 dB.</detail><detail>A rock concert is between 110 dB and 120 dB and can be as high as 140 dB right in front of the speakers.</detail><detail>Headphones at maximum volume are 105 dB. </detail><text>The risk of damage to your hearing when listening to music depends on:</text><detail>How loud the music is</detail><detail>How close you may be to the speakers</detail><detail>How long and how often you are exposed to loud music</detail><detail>Headphone use</detail><detail>Family history of hearing loss </detail><text>Activities or jobs that increase your chance of hearing loss from music are:</text><detail>Being a musician, sound crew member, or recording engineer</detail><detail>Working at a night club</detail><detail>Attending concerts</detail><detail>Using portable music devices with headphones or ear buds </detail><text>Children who play in school bands can be exposed to high decibel sounds, depending on which instruments they sit near or play.</text></h2><h2 title="When at a Concert"><text>Rolled-up napkins or tissues do almost nothing to protect your ears at concerts. </text><text>Two types of earplugs are available to wear:</text><detail>Foam or silicone earplugs, available at drugstores, help reduce noise. They will muffle sounds and voices but may fit poorly.</detail><detail>Custom-fit musician earplugs fit better than foam or silicone ones and do not change the sound quality. </detail><text>Other tips while in music venues are:</text><detail>Sit at least 10 feet (3 m) or more away from speakers</detail><detail>Take breaks in quieter areas. Limit your time around noise.</detail><detail>Move around the venue to find a quieter spot.</detail><detail>Avoid having others shout in your ear to be heard. This can cause further harm to your ears.</detail><detail>Avoid too much alcohol, which can make you unaware of the pain louder sounds can cause. </detail><text>Rest your ears for 24 hours after exposure to loud music to give them a chance to recover.</text></h2><h2 title="How to Listen to Music on Your iPod or MP3 Player"><text>The small ear bud style headphones (inserted into the ears) DO NOT block outside sounds. Users tend to turn up the volume to block out other noise. Using noise-cancelling earphones may help you keep the volume down because you can more easily hear the music.</text><text>If you wear headphones, the volume is too loud if a person standing near you can hear the music through your headphones.</text><text>Other tips about headphones are:</text><detail>Decrease the amount of time you use headphones.</detail><detail>Turn down the volume. Listening to music at level 5 or above for just 15 minutes per day may cause long-term hearing damage.</detail><detail>Do not raise the volume past the halfway point on the volume bar when using headphones. Or, use the volume limiter on your device. This will prevent you from turning the sound up too high. </detail></h2><h2 title="When to Call the Doctor"><text>If you have ringing in your ears or your hearing is muffled for more than 24 hours after exposure to loud music, have your hearing checked by an audiologist.</text><text>See your health care provider for signs of hearing loss if: </text><detail>Some sounds seem louder than they should be.</detail><detail>It is easier to hear men's voices than women's voices.</detail><detail>You have trouble telling high-pitched sounds (such as "s" or "th") from one another.</detail><detail>Other people's voices sound mumbled or slurred.</detail><detail>You need to turn the television or radio up or down.</detail><detail>You have ringing or a full feeling in your ears.</detail></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>Noise induced hearing loss - music; Sensory hearing loss - music</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 5/17/2018"><text>Updated by: Josef Shargorodsky, MD, MPH, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD.

<item><title>Healthy habits for weight loss</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000733.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>Whether it is healthy or unhealthy, a habit is something you do without having to think about it. People who succeed at weight loss, turn healthy eating into a habit.</text><text>These healthy eating habits can help you lose weight and keep it off.</text></h2><h2 title="Set up Your Kitchen"><text>The family kitchen can trigger unhealthy eating habits if your shelves are lined with sugary snacks. Rearrange the kitchen to make diet-boosting foods the most natural choice.</text><detail>Keep healthy food in sight. Keep a bowl of fruit on the counter and pre-chopped vegetables in the refrigerator. When you feel hungry, you'll have a healthy snack close at hand.</detail><detail>Reduce temptation. If you know you can't control yourself around cookies, keep them and other diet-busting foods out of reach, or even better, out of the house.</detail><detail>Always eat off dishes. Eating straight out of a container or a bag promotes overeating.</detail><detail>Use smaller plates. If you start a meal with less food in front of you, you will likely eat less by the time it is over. </detail></h2><h2 title="Practice Healthy Eating"><text>Life gets busy and a lot of people end up eating without thinking about the food they're putting in their mouths. The following habits can help you avoid this mindless eating.</text><detail>Eat breakfast. An empty stomach is an invitation to overeat. Start your day with whole-grain bread or cereal, low-fat milk or yogurt, and a piece of fruit.</detail><detail>Plan ahead. DO NOT wait until you are hungry to decide what to eat. Plan your meals and go shopping when you feel full. Unhealthy options will be easier to pass by.</detail><detail>Power down your screen. Eating with your eyes on the TV, computer, or any other distracting screen takes your mind off what you're eating. Not only do you miss out on tasting your food, you are more likely to overeat.</detail><detail>Eat healthy food first. Start with soup or salad and you'll be less hungry when you turn to the main course. Just steer clear of cream-based soups and salad dressings.</detail><detail>Eat small snacks often. Rather than 2 or 3 large meals, you can eat smaller meals and healthy snacks to keep yourself going throughout the day.</detail><detail>Weigh yourself. The information on the scale will help you see how your weight goes up or down depending on how you eat.</detail><detail>Keep your house cool. Feeling slightly chilly in winter may help you burn more calories than if you keep your home on the warmer side. </detail></h2><h2 title="Break old Habits"><text>Emotional eating, or eating for comfort rather than nutrition, can make a big difference in what and how much you eat. To improve your relationship with food:</text><detail>Pay attention. Listen to your body for how certain foods make you feel. Fried food might taste great now. But how will it feel in your stomach an hour from now?</detail><detail>Slow down. Put down your fork between bites or have a conversation as you eat. By pacing yourself, you give your stomach a chance to feel full.</detail><detail>Keep track. Read the nutrition labels on your food before you eat it. Write down what you plan to eat before you eat. Both of these habits make you stop and think before you put something in your mouth.</detail><detail>Change how you talk about food. Instead of saying "I can't eat that," say, "I don't eat that." Saying you can't may make you feel deprived. Saying you don't puts you in charge. </detail></h2><h2 title="Get Support"><text>Friends and family can help you stay on track and encourage you along the way. Be sure to pick people who understand how important this is and who will support you; not judge you or try to tempt you with old eating habits.</text><detail>Send progress reports. Tell your friends your goal weight and send them weekly updates of how you are doing.</detail><detail>Use social media. Some mobile apps let you log everything you eat and share that with select friends. This can help you record and be accountable for what you eat. </detail></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>Obesity - healthy habits; Obesity - healthy eating</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 4/15/2018"><text>Updated by: Linda J.

<item><title>Healthy grocery shopping</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000336.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>A key step for losing weight, keeping the weight off, and staying healthy is learning how to buy the right foods at the store. This will ensure you have healthy choices at home. Avoid bringing unhealthy choices, such as chips or cookies, into the home. Having to go out to buy an unhealthy treat gives you more time to make a conscious decision about eating that food.</text></h2><h2 title="Smart Shopping "><text>Avoid buying snack foods in bulk and shopping in warehouse-type stores if you can. Getting a good deal can lead to overeating. If you do buy large amounts of a food, divide it into smaller portion sizes and store what you will not use right away.</text><text>PROTEIN</text><text>When you buy protein, choose:</text><detail>Lean ground turkey or chicken and skinless turkey or chicken breasts.</detail><detail>Lean meat, such as bison (buffalo) and lean cuts of pork and beef (such as round, top sirloin, and tenderloin). Look for ground meats that are at least 97% lean.</detail><detail>Fish, such as salmon, whitefish, sardines, herring, tilapia, and cod.</detail><detail>Low-fat or nonfat dairy products.</detail><detail>Eggs.</detail><detail>Legumes, such as pinto beans, black beans, kidney beans, lentils, and garbanzo beans. Canned beans are convenient but if you have the time to prepare them from scratch, dried beans are much cheaper. Low for low-sodium canned goods.</detail><detail>Soy proteins, such as tofu or tempeh. </detail><text>FRUITS AND VEGETABLES</text><text>Buy plenty of fruits and vegetables. They will fill you up and provide vitamins, minerals, and other nutrients your body needs. Some buying tips:</text><detail>One medium-sized apple has only 72 calories.</detail><detail>1 cup (130 gram) carrots has only 45 calories.</detail><detail>1 cup (160 gram) of cut up cantaloupe melon has only 55 calories.</detail><detail>Select canned fruits that are packed in water or juice, not syrup, and have no sugar added. </detail><text>Frozen fruits and vegetable can be good choices as long as there is no added sugar or salt. Some benefits of frozen fruits and vegetables include:</text><detail>Can be as nutritious or sometimes more nutritious than fresh as long as they do not contain added sauces.</detail><detail>Will not go bad as quickly as fresh.</detail><detail>Easy to prepare. Bags of frozen veggies that steam in the microwave can be ready in under 5 minutes. </detail><text>BREADS AND GRAINS</text><text>Choose healthy breads, cereals, and pasta, such as:</text><detail>Whole-grain breads and rolls (read the label to make sure the first ingredient is whole wheat/whole grain.)</detail><detail>All bran, 100% bran, and Shredded Wheat cereals (look for cereals with at least 4 grams of fiber per serving.)</detail><detail>Whole-wheat or other whole-grain pasta.</detail><detail>Other grains such as millet, quinoa, amaranth, and bulgur. </detail><detail>Rolled oats (not instant oatmeal). </detail><text>Limit refined grain or "white flour" products. They are much more likely to:</text><detail>Be high in sugar and fats, which add calories.</detail><detail>Be low in fiber and protein.</detail><detail>Lack vitamins, minerals, and other important nutrients. </detail></h2><h2 title="Plan Ahead"><text>Before you buy food for the week, think about your schedule:</text><detail>When and where you will be eating over the next week?</detail><detail>How much time will you have to cook?</detail><text>Then, plan your meals before you shop. This can keep you from buying whatever foods look good to you, whether or not they are healthy.</text><text>Make a shopping list. Having a list reduces impulse buys and ensures that you will purchase all of the ingredients you need. </text><text>Never go food shopping when you are hungry. You will make better choices if you shop after you have had a healthy meal or snack.</text></h2><h2 title="Know How to Read Food Labels "><text>Learn how to read the Nutrition Facts labels on food packages. Know what the serving size is and the amount of calories, fat, protein, and carbohydrates per serving. If a bag contains 2 servings and you eat the whole bag, you will need to multiply the amount of fat, protein, and carbohydrate by 2.</text><text>Two words on food labels that can be misleading are "natural" and "pure." </text><text>Some other tips for reading labels and buying healthy foods are:</text><detail>Choose tuna and other canned fish that is packed in water, not oil.</detail><detail>Check the label for the words "hydrogenated" or "partially hydrogenated" in the list of ingredients. These are unhealthy trans fats. The closer to the beginning of the list these words are, the more of them the food contains. The label will give the total trans fat content, and you want this to be zero. Even foods that are listed as having zero grams trans fats may have traces so you still should also be sure to look at the ingredient list.</detail><detail>Carefully read the label of any food that claims it is a weight-loss product. Even though these words are used, the food may not be a healthy choice for you.</detail><detail>Know what "lite" and "light" mean. The word "lite" can mean fewer calories, but sometimes not much fewer. There is no set standard for that word. If a product says "light," it must have at least 1/3 fewer calories than the regular food has, but it may still not be a low-calorie or healthy option. </detail></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>Obesity - grocery shopping; Overweight - grocery shopping; Weight loss - grocery shopping; Healthy diet - grocery shopping</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 8/14/2016"><text>Updated by: Emily Wax, RD, The Brooklyn Hospital Center, Brooklyn, NY.

<item><title>Healthy food trends -- quinoa</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000731.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>Quinoa (pronounced "keen-wah") is a hearty, protein-rich seed, considered by many to be a whole grain. A "whole grain" contains all of the original parts of the grain or seed, making it a healthier and more complete food. Quinoa is in the same plant family with Swiss chard, spinach, and sugar beets.</text><text>Quinoa is gluten-free, and the flour is a good substitute for wheat flour. Mild and nutty flavored, quinoa can be enjoyed in many ways.</text></h2><h2 title="Why it is Good for you"><text>Quinoa is rich in protein. It has almost twice the amount of protein found in oats, and a bit more fiber and iron. Quinoa is a complete protein.</text><text>You need protein in your diet to help your body repair cells and make new ones. Protein is also important for growth and development during childhood, adolescence, and pregnancy. Quinoa's high protein content makes it a good option in place of rice and other high-carbohydrate, low-protein grains, especially for people with diabetes.</text><text>Quinoa is also a good source of potassium, which you need for muscle and protein building, maintaining a regular heartbeat, and many other bodily functions. It offers many other vitamins and minerals as well.</text><text>Quinoa has several antioxidants, like those found in berries. Antioxidants help prevent cell damage. This is important for healing, prevention of disease, and aging.</text><text>If you have celiac disease, or follow a gluten-free diet, quinoa is a great option. It does not contain gluten.</text><text>Quinoa contains heart-healthy fats that can help boost your "good cholesterol." It is filling and packs a nutritious punch in a small amount.</text></h2><h2 title="How it is Prepared"><text>Quinoa can be cooked and eaten in many ways. You will need to simmer it in water like rice. Add 1 part quinoa to 2 parts water or stock and simmer until tender, for about 15 minutes.</text><text>To add quinoa to your diet:</text><detail> 
 Add cooked quinoa to your salad, soups, or pasta dishes. 
 </detail><detail> 
 Make it a side dish. Think of quinoa as your new rice. Combine cooked quinoa with herbs, beans, vegetables, and seasonings and serve with your meal. Add a healthy protein like chicken or fish if you choose.</detail><detail> 
 Use quinoa flour instead of wheat flour in your muffins, pancakes, cookies, or any time you bake. </detail><text>When quinoa is finished cooking, it looks like curly threads are around each grain. Make a big batch of cooked quinoa and store it in the refrigerator for up to a week. Take it out for several meals as you need it.</text></h2><h2 title="Where to Find Quinoa"><text>Quinoa may be purchased online or at any health food store. Major grocery stores may also carry bags of quinoa in their natural or organic food sections. You can also purchase quinoa flour, pasta, and cereal products.</text><text>There are over one hundred varieties of quinoa. But you will most likely see yellow/ivory, red, or black quinoa in stores.</text><text>Uncooked, you can store it in your pantry for several months. Use an airtight container or bag for storage.</text></h2><h2 title="Recipe"><text>There are many delicious recipes using quinoa.

<item><title>Healthy food trends -- flaxseeds</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000728.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>Flaxseeds are tiny brown or gold seeds that come from the flax plant. They have a very mild, nutty flavor and are rich in fiber and a variety of other nutrients. Ground flaxseeds are easiest to digest and may provide more nutrients than whole seeds, which can pass through your digestive system undigested.</text><text>Flaxseed oil comes from pressed flax seeds.</text></h2><h2 title="Why They are Good for you"><text>Flaxseeds contain fiber, vitamins, minerals, protein, healthy plant-based fats, and antioxidants that help prevent cell damage</text><text>Flaxseeds are a good source of soluble and insoluble fiber which help keep your bowel movements regular and prevent constipation. Flaxseeds are also a good source of:</text><detail>Vitamins B1, B2, and B6</detail><detail>Copper</detail><detail>Phosphorus</detail><detail>Magnesium</detail><detail>Manganese </detail><text>These vitamins and minerals help support your energy, immune system, nervous system, bones, blood, heartbeat, and many other bodily processes.</text><text>Flaxseeds are also rich in omega-3s and omega-6s which are essential fatty acids (substances that your body needs to function). These substances are not made in the body. You must get them from foods like seafood and flaxseeds.</text><text>Oils, such as canola and soybean oil, contain the same fatty acids as flax oil. But flax oil contains more. Next to seafood, flax oil is one of the best sources of omega-3 fatty acids. Eating flaxseeds can help boost your omega-3s, though flax primarily provides ALA, not EPA and DHA.</text><text>Half of flaxseed calories come from fat. But this is healthy fat that helps boost your "good cholesterol." The small amount would not prevent weight control.</text><text>Consuming flaxseeds has been shown to reduce cholesterol levels. Researchers are looking at whether consuming more of the essential fatty acids found in flaxseeds will improve blood pressure, blood sugar, heart health, and other areas.</text><text>If you plan to consume flaxseeds or flax oil on a regular basis, talk with your doctor. It may affect how certain medicines work.</text></h2><h2 title="How They are Prepared"><text>Flaxseeds can be added to or sprinkled on almost any food. Some cereals, such as raisin bran, now come with flaxseeds already mixed in.</text><text>Grinding whole seeds will help you get the most nutrients. To add flaxseeds to your diet, add ground flax to:</text><detail>Pancakes, French toast, or other baked goods mixes</detail><detail>Smoothies, yogurt, or cereals</detail><detail>Soups, salads, or pasta dishes</detail><detail>Also use in place of bread crumbs</detail></h2><h2 title="Where to Find Flaxseeds"><text>Flaxseeds may be purchased online or at any health food store. Many major grocery stores also carry flaxseeds in their natural or organic food sections.</text><text>Simply buy a bag or container of flaxseeds in whole, crushed, or milled form, depending on the texture you like. You can also buy flaxseed oil.</text><text>Avoid raw and unripe flaxseeds.</text></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>Healthy food trends - flax meal; Healthy food trends - flax seeds; Healthy food trends - linseeds; Healthy snacks - flaxseeds; Healthy diet - flaxseeds; Wellness - flaxseeds</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 4/23/2018"><text>Updated by: Emily Wax, RD, The Brooklyn Hospital Center, Brooklyn, NY.

<item><title>Healthy food trends -- chia seeds</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000727.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>Chia seeds are tiny, brown, black or white seeds. They are almost as small as poppy seeds. They come from a plant in the mint family. Chia seeds deliver several important nutrients in just a few calories and a small package.</text><text>You can eat this nutty-flavored seed in many ways.</text></h2><h2 title="Why They are Good for you"><text>Chia seeds are rich in fiber, healthy fats, and antioxidants that help prevent cell damage.</text><text>Chia seeds are a good source of insoluble fiber. The seeds expand quite a bit and form a gel when they come into contact with water. This gel adds bulk to your stool, which keeps bowel movements regular and helps prevent constipation. The added bulk also may help you feel fuller and so you eat less.</text><text>Just 1 tablespoon (15 milliliters, mL) of chia seeds will give you 19% of your recommended daily fiber.</text><text>Chia seeds are also rich in essential fatty acids, omega-3 and omega-6. Essential fatty acids are fatty substances that your body needs to function. They are not made in the body, and you must get them from foods.</text><text>The oil in chia seeds contains higher amounts of essential fatty acids compared to other oils, even flax seed (linseed) oil.</text><text>Researchers are looking at whether consuming more of the fatty acids found in chia seeds can improve blood pressure, heart health, blood sugar, or provide other benefits.</text></h2><h2 title="How They are Prepared"><text>Chia seeds can be added or sprinkled on almost anything.

But including microgreens in your diet can give you a nutrient boost in just a few calories.</text><text>Although it is not well-proven, a healthy diet rich in fruits and vegetables may reduce the risk for cancer and other chronic diseases. If you take blood-thinning medicine, such as anticoagulant or antiplatelet drugs, you may need to limit vitamin K foods. Vitamin K can affect how these medicines work.</text></h2><h2 title="How They are Prepared"><text>Microgreens can be eaten in several simple ways. Be sure to rinse them thoroughly first.</text><detail>
   Eat them raw. Add them to salads and drizzle with a little lemon juice or dressing. They are also very tasty on their own.</detail><detail>
   Garnish meals with raw microgreens. Add them to your breakfast plate. Top your fish, chicken, or baked potato with microgreens.</detail><detail>
   Add them to a sandwich or wrap.
   </detail><detail>
   Add them to soups, stir fries, and pasta dishes.
   </detail><detail>
   Add them to a fruit drink or cocktail.

<item><title>Healthy food trends - Brussels sprouts</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000725.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>Brussels sprouts are small, round, green vegetables. They are most often about 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5 centimeters) wide. They belong to the cabbage family, which also includes kale, broccoli, collard greens, and cauliflower. In fact, Brussels sprouts look like tiny cabbages, but they are milder in flavor.</text><text>Brussels sprouts are tender for eating when they are cooked; they may also be served raw when shredded. They are full of nutrients and can be included in many meals.</text></h2><h2 title="Why They are Good for you"><text>Brussels sprouts are full of vitamins, minerals, and fiber. You can count on Brussels sprouts to support your immune system, blood and bone health, and more. Eating just a few Brussels sprouts will give you plenty of vitamin C and vitamin K.</text><text>Brussels sprouts rank high in antioxidants, just after kale and spinach. Antioxidants are substances that can help you stay healthy by preventing cell damage in the body. Just half cup (120 milliliters, mL) of cooked Brussels sprouts will give you almost half of your daily recommended amount of vitamin C.</text><text>Many other vitamins and minerals are in Brussels sprouts, including vitamin A, potassium, and folate. Regularly eating Brussels sprouts and similar vegetables may help to prevent many common cancers, although this is not proven.</text><text>Brussels sprouts are very filling. The leaves are tightly packed and dense. They are also low in calories, so they can help you maintain a healthy weight. A cup (240 mL) of Brussels sprouts has about 3 grams (g) each of fiber and protein and just 75 calories. </text><text>If you take the blood-thinning drug, warfarin (Coumadin), you may need to limit your intake of foods that are high in vitamin K. Warfarin makes your blood less likely to form clots. Vitamin K and foods containing vitamin K can affect how blood-thinners work.</text></h2><h2 title="How They are Prepared"><text>Before you cook Brussels sprouts, be sure to wash and clean them. Cut off the tough bottom and remove any outer, wilted leaves. When cleaning Brussels sprouts before cooking, cut an X-shape in the bottom after you trim the tough bottom.

Add whole wheat or high fiber pasta as well. </detail><text>Boiling Brussel sprouts is not recommended because much of the vitamin C is lost with this cooking method.</text></h2><h2 title="Where to Find Brussels Sprouts"><text>Brussels sprouts are available year round in the grocery store produce section. You will find them near the broccoli and other greens. Pick Brussels sprouts that are firm and bright green. Avoid Brussels sprouts that are soft or yellowing.</text><text>Put Brussels sprouts on your weekly shopping list.

Just 1 cup (240 mL) of cooked black beans will give you 15 grams (g) of fiber, which is about half of the recommended daily amount for adults.</text><text>Legumes are packed with nutrients. They are low in calories, but make you feel full. The body uses the carbohydrates in legumes slowly, over time, providing steady energy for the body, brain, and nervous system. Eating more legumes as part of a healthy diet can help lower blood sugar, blood pressure, heart rate, and other heart disease and diabetes risks.</text><text>Beans and legumes contain antioxidants that help prevent cell damage and fight disease and aging. The fiber and other nutrients benefit the digestive system, and may even help to prevent digestive cancers.</text></h2><h2 title="How They are Prepared"><text>Legumes can be added to any meal, for breakfast, lunch, or dinner. Once cooked, they can be eaten warm or cold.</text><text>Most dry beans (except peas and lentils) will need to be rinsed, soaked, and cooked.</text><detail>Rinse beans in cold water and pick out any pebbles or stems.</detail><detail>Cover the beans with 3 times their amount in water.</detail><detail>Soak for 6 hours. </detail><text>You can also bring dried beans to a boil, take the pan off the burner, and let them soak for 2 hours. Soaking overnight or after boiling makes them less likely to give you gas.</text><text>To cook your beans:</text><detail>Drain and add fresh water.</detail><detail>Cook the beans according to the instructions on your package. </detail><text>To add cooked or canned beans to your diet:</text><detail>Add them to salsas, soups, salads, tacos, burritos, chili, or pasta dishes.</detail><detail>Include them as a side dish at breakfast, lunch, or dinner.</detail><detail>Mash them up for dips and spreads.</detail><detail>Use bean flour to bake them. </detail><text>To reduce the gas caused by eating beans:</text><detail>Always soak dried beans.</detail><detail>If you do not eat a lot of beans, gradually add them to your diet. This helps your body get used to the extra fiber.</detail><detail>Chew them well. </detail></h2><h2 title="Where to Find Legumes"><text>Legumes may be purchased at any grocery store or online. They DO NOT cost a lot of money and can be stored for a very long time. They come in bags (dried beans), cans (already cooked), or jars.</text></h2><h2 title="Recipe"><text>There are many delicious recipes using beans. Here is one you can try.</text><text>Ingredients</text><detail>Two cans low-sodium black beans (15 oz.), or 425 g</detail><detail>Half medium onion</detail><detail>Two garlic cloves</detail><detail>Two tablespoons (30 mL) vegetable oil</detail><detail>Half teaspoon (2.5 mL) cumin (ground)</detail><detail>Half teaspoon (2.5 mL) salt</detail><detail>One quarter teaspoon (1.2 mL) oregano (fresh or dried) </detail><text>Instructions</text><detail>Carefully drain the juice from 1 can of black beans. Pour the drained black beans into a bowl. Use a potato masher to mash the beans until they are no longer whole. Set the mashed beans aside.</detail><detail>Chop the onion into one quarter inch pieces. Set the onions aside.</detail><detail>Peel the garlic cloves and mince them finely. Set the garlic aside.</detail><detail>In a medium sauce pan, heat your cooking oil over medium high heat. Add the onions and sauté for 1 to 2 minutes.</detail><detail>Stir in the garlic and cumin and cook for 30 seconds more.</detail><detail>Stir in the mashed black beans and the second can of black beans, including the juice.</detail><detail>When the beans begin to boil, reduce the heat to low, stir in the salt and oregano and simmer for 10 minutes, uncovered. </detail><text>Source: United States Department of Agriculture</text></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>Healthy food trends - pulses; Healthy eating - beans and legumes; Weight loss - beans and legumes; Healthy diet - beans and legumes; Wellness - beans and legumes</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 4/23/2018"><text>Updated by: Emily Wax, RD, The Brooklyn Hospital Center, Brooklyn, NY.

This can lead to osteoarthritis, a disease that causes joint pain and stiffness.</detail><detail>Stopping breathing during sleep (sleep apnea). This can cause daytime fatigue or sleepiness, poor attention, and problems at work.</detail><detail>Gallstones and liver problems.</detail><detail>Some cancers.</detail><text>Three things can be used to determine if a person's body fat gives them a higher chance of developing obesity-related diseases:</text><detail>Body mass index (BMI)</detail><detail>Waist size</detail><detail>Other risk factors the person has (a risk factor is anything that increases your chance of getting a disease) </detail><picname>Obesity and health</picname><picurl>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/images/ency/fullsize/19473.jpg</picurl></h2><h2 title="Body Mass Index "><text>Body mass index (BMI) is calculated using height and weight. It is used to estimate body fat. </text><text>Starting at 25.0, the higher your BMI, the greater is your risk of developing obesity-related health problems. These ranges of BMI are used to describe levels of risk:</text><detail>Overweight (not obese), if BMI is 25.0 to 29.9</detail><detail>Class 1 (low-risk) obesity, if BMI is 30.0 to 34.9</detail><detail>Class 2 (moderate-risk) obesity, if BMI is 35.0 to 39.9</detail><detail>Class 3 (high-risk) obesity, if BMI is equal to or greater than 40.0 </detail></h2><h2 title="Waist Size"><text>Women with a waist size greater than 35 inches (89 centimeters) and men with a waist size greater than 40 inches (102 centimeters) have an increased risk for heart disease and type 2 diabetes. People with "apple-shaped" bodies (waist is bigger than the hips) also have an increased risk for these conditions.</text></h2><h2 title="Risk Factors"><text>Having a risk factor doesn't mean that you will get the disease. But it does increase the chance that you will. Some risk factors, like age, race, or family history can't be changed.</text><text>The more risk factors you have, the more likely it is that you will develop the disease or health problem.</text><text>Your risk of developing health problems such as heart disease, stroke, and kidney problems increases if you're obese and have these risk factors:</text><detail>High blood pressure (hypertension)</detail><detail>High blood cholesterol or triglycerides</detail><detail>High blood glucose (sugar), a sign of type 2 diabetes </detail><text>These other risk factors for heart disease and stroke are not caused by obesity: </text><detail>Having a family member under the age of 50 with heart disease</detail><detail>Being physically inactive or having a sedentary lifestyle</detail><detail>Smoking or using tobacco products of any kind </detail></h2><h2 title="Summing it up"><text>You can control many of these risk factors by changing your lifestyle. If you have obesity, your health care provider can help you begin a weight-loss program. A starting goal of losing 5% to 10% of your current weight will reduce your risk of developing obesity-related diseases.</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 5/21/2017"><text>Updated by: Laura J.

If you are drinking any of these, you are using alcohol. Your drinking patterns may vary, depending on who you are with and what you are doing.</text><text>Drinking an excessive amount of alcohol can put you at risk for alcohol-related problems if:</text><detail>You are a man who has 15 or more drinks a week, or often have 5 or more drinks at a time.</detail><detail>You are a woman who has 8 or more drinks a week, or often have 4 or more drinks at a time. </detail><text>One drink is defined as 12 ounces (355 milliliters, mL) of beer, 5 ounces (148 mL) of wine, or a 1 1/2-ounce (44 mL) shot of liquor.</text></h2><h2 title="Alcohol Use and Your Health"><text>Long-term excessive alcohol use increases your chances of:</text><detail>Bleeding from the stomach or esophagus (the tube the food travels through from your mouth to your stomach).</detail><detail>Swelling and damage to the pancreas. Your pancreas produces substances your body needs to work well.</detail><detail>Damage to the liver. When severe, liver damage often leads to death.</detail><detail>Poor nutrition.</detail><detail>Cancer of the esophagus, liver, colon, head and neck, breasts, and other areas. </detail><text>Excessive drinking can also:</text><detail>Make it harder to control high blood pressure with medicines if you already have high blood pressure.</detail><detail>Lead to heart problems in some people. </detail><text>Alcohol can affect your thinking and judgment each time you drink.

Severe birth defects or fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) may occur.</text></h2><h2 title="How Alcohol Use Can Affect Your Life"><text>People often drink to make themselves feel better or to block feelings of sadness, depression, nervousness, or worry. But alcohol can:</text><detail>Make these problems worse over time.</detail><detail>Cause sleep problems or make them worse.</detail><detail>Increase the risk for suicide. </detail><text>Families are often affected when someone in the home uses alcohol. Violence and conflict in the home is much more likely when a family member is abusing alcohol. Children who grow up in a home where alcohol abuse is present are more likely to:</text><detail>Do poorly in school.</detail><detail>Be depressed and have problems with anxiety and low self-esteem.</detail><detail>Have marriages that end in divorce. </detail><text>Drinking too much alcohol even once can harm you or others.

This is called a hand (or metacarpal) fracture. Some hand fractures require wearing a splint or a cast. Some need to be repaired with surgery.</text></h2><h2 title="Types of Hand Fractures"><text>Your fracture may be in one of the following areas on your hand:</text><detail>On your knuckle</detail><detail>Just below your knuckle (sometimes called a boxer's fracture)</detail><detail>In the shaft or middle part of the bone</detail><detail>At the base of the bone, near your wrist</detail><detail>A displaced fracture (this means part of the bone is not in its normal position) </detail><text>If you have a bad break, you may be referred to a bone doctor (orthopedic surgeon). You may need surgery to insert pins and plates to repair the fracture. </text></h2><h2 title="What to Expect"><text>You will likely have to wear a splint. The splint will cover part of your fingers and both sides of your hand and wrist. Your health care provider will tell you how long you need to wear the splint. Usually, it is for about 3 weeks. </text><text>If you had surgery, you may have a cast instead of a splint.</text><text>Most fractures heal well. After healing, your knuckle may look different or your finger may move in a different way when you close your hand. </text><text>Some fractures require surgery.

<item><title>Halo brace</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000799.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>A halo brace holds your child's head and neck still so that bones and ligaments in the neck can heal. Your child's head and torso will move as one when your child is moving around. Your child can still do many activities when wearing the halo brace.</text><text>There are two parts to a halo brace:</text><detail>The halo ring that goes around the forehead. The ring is attached to the head with small pins that go into the bone of your child's head.</detail><detail>A stiff vest that is worn under clothes. Rods go down from the halo ring and connect to the shoulders of the vest. </detail><text>Talk to your health care provider about how long your child will wear the halo brace. Children usually wear the brace for 2 to 4 months, depending on the injury and how fast it heals. The halo brace stays on at all times. Only the provider will take it off. Your provider will do x-rays to see if your child's neck has healed. The halo brace can be removed in the office. </text></h2><h2 title="Putting on the Halo Brace"><text>It takes about 1 to 2 hours to put on the halo. </text><text>Your provider will numb the area where the pins will be put in. Your child will feel pressure when the pins go in. X-rays are taken to make sure the brace is keeping your child's neck straight. Your provider may have to readjust it to get the best alignment of your child's neck.</text><text>Help keep your child comfortable and calm so that the provider can make a good fit.</text><text>Wearing the halo brace should not be painful for your child. When they first start wearing the brace, some children complain of the pin sites hurting, their forehead hurting, or having a headache. The pain may be worse when your child chews or yawns. Most children get used to the brace and the pain goes away. If the pain does not go away or gets worse, the pins may need to be adjusted. DO NOT do this yourself. Call your provider. </text><text>If the vest is not fitted well, your child might complain because of pressure points over their shoulder or back, especially during the first few days. You should report this to your provider. The vest can be adjusted and pads can be put in place to avoid pressure points and skin damage. </text></h2><h2 title="Taking Care of Your Child's Skin"><text>While your child is wearing the halo brace, you will need to learn to care for your child's skin.</text><text>PIN CARE</text><text>Clean the pin sites twice a day. Sometimes, a crust forms around the pins. Clean the area this way to prevent infection:</text><detail>Wash your hands with soap and water.</detail><detail>Dip a cotton swab into a skin-cleaning solution, such as hydrogen peroxide, povidone iodine, or another antiseptic your provider recommends. Use the cotton swab to wipe and scrub around one pin site. Make sure to remove any crust.</detail><detail>Use a new cotton swab with each pin.</detail><detail>You can apply antibiotic ointment daily at the point where the pin enters into the skin. </detail><text>Check the pin sites for infection. Call your provider if your child has any of these signs of infection at a pin site:</text><detail>Redness or swelling</detail><detail>Pus</detail><detail>Open wounds</detail><detail>Increased pain </detail><text>
WASHING YOUR CHILD</text><text>DO NOT put your child in the shower or bath. The halo brace should not get wet. Wash your child by hand following these steps:</text><detail>Cover the edges of the vest with a dry towel. Cut holes in a plastic bag for your child's head and arms and put it over the vest.</detail><detail>Have your child sit in a chair.</detail><detail>Wash your child with a damp washcloth and mild soap. Wipe off soap with a damp towel. DO NOT use sponges that can leak water onto the brace and vest.</detail><detail>Check for redness or irritation, especially where the vest touches the skin.</detail><detail>Shampoo your child's hair over a sink or tub. If your child is small, they can lie on the kitchen counter with their head over the sink.</detail><detail>If the vest and skin under the vest ever gets wet, dry it with a hairdryer set on COOL. </detail><text>CLEAN THE INSIDE OF THE VEST</text><detail>You cannot remove the vest to wash it.</detail><detail>Dip a long strip of surgical gauze in witch hazel and wring it out so it is just a little damp.</detail><detail>Put the gauze through from top to the bottom of the vest and slide it back and forth. This cleans the vest liner. You can also do this if your child's skin is itchy.</detail><detail>Use cornstarch baby powder around the edges of the vest to make it feel smoother next to your child's skin.</detail></h2><h2 title="Activities"><text>Your child can do their usual activities like school, schoolwork, and nonathletic club activities.</text><text>Your child cannot look down when they walk. Keep areas clear of things that can trip your child. Some children may use a cane or walker to help keep steady when walking.</text><text>DO NOT let your child do activities like sports, running, or bike riding. </text><text>Help your child find a comfortable way to sleep. Your child can sleep the way they usually do, such as on their back, side, or stomach. Try a pillow or a rolled towel under their neck to give support. Use pillows to support the halo.</text></h2><h2 title="When to Call the Doctor"><text>Call your provider if:</text><detail>Pin sites are red, swollen, or have pus or pain</detail><detail>Your child can nod their head</detail><detail>Any parts of the brace or vest become loose</detail><detail>Your child complains of numbness, changes in feeling in their arms, hands, or legs</detail><detail>Your child cannot do their usual non-sports activities</detail><detail>Your child has a fever</detail><detail>Your child has pain where the vest might be putting too much pressure on their body, such as at the top of the shoulders </detail></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>Halo orthosis</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 10/6/2017"><text>Updated by: Luc Jasmin, MD, PhD, FRCS (C), FACS, Department of Surgery at Providence Medical Center, Medford, OR; Department of Surgery at Ashland Community Hospital, Ashland, OR; Department of Maxillofacial Surgery at UCSF, San Francisco, CA.

<item><title>Ischemic ulcers - self-care</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000742.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>Ischemic ulcers (wounds) can occur when there is poor blood flow in your legs. Ischemic means reduced blood flow to an area of the body. Poor blood flow causes cells to die and damages tissue. Most ischemic ulcers occur on the feet and legs. These types of wounds can be slow to heal.</text></h2><h2 title="Causes"><text>Clogged arteries (atherosclerosis) are the most common cause of ischemic ulcers.</text><detail>Clogged arteries prevent a healthy supply of blood from flowing to the legs. This means that the tissues in your legs do not get enough nutrients and oxygen.</detail><detail>The lack of nutrients causes cells to die, damaging the tissue.</detail><detail>Damaged tissue that does not get enough blood flow also tends to heal more slowly. </detail><text>Conditions in which the skin becomes inflamed and fluid builds up in the legs can also cause ischemic ulcers.</text><text>People with poor blood flow often also have nerve damage or foot ulcers from diabetes. Nerve damage makes it harder to feel an area in the shoe that rubs and causes a sore. Once a sore forms, poor blood flow makes it harder for the sore to heal.</text></h2><h2 title="Symptoms"><text>Symptoms of ischemic ulcers include:</text><detail>Wounds may appear on legs, ankles, toes, and between toes.</detail><detail>Dark red, yellow, gray, or black sores.</detail><detail>Raised edges around the wound (looks punched out).</detail><detail>No bleeding.</detail><detail>Deep wound through which tendons may show through.</detail><detail>Wound may or may not be painful.</detail><detail>Skin on the leg appears shiny, tight, dry, and hairless.</detail><detail>Dangling the leg down off the side of a bed or chair causes the leg to turn red.</detail><detail>When you raise the leg it turns pale and cool to touch.</detail><detail>Aching pain in the foot or leg, often at night. Pain may go away when the leg is dangled down.</detail></h2><h2 title="Who is At Risk?"><text>Anyone with poor circulation is at risk for ischemic wounds. Other conditions that can cause ischemic wounds include:</text><detail>Diseases that cause inflammation, such as lupus</detail><detail>High blood pressure</detail><detail>High cholesterol levels</detail><detail>Chronic kidney disease</detail><detail>Blockage of the lymph vessels, which causes fluid to build up in the legs</detail><detail>Smoking </detail></h2><h2 title="Wound Care"><text>To treat an ischemic ulcer, blood flow to your legs needs to be restored. You may need to take medicine. In some cases, you may need surgery.</text><text>Your health care provider will show you how to care for your wound. The basic instructions are:</text><detail>Always keep the wound clean and bandaged to prevent infection.</detail><detail>Your provider will tell you how often you need to change the dressing.</detail><detail>Keep the dressing and the skin around it dry. Try not to get healthy tissue around the wound too wet. This can soften the health tissue, causing the wound to get bigger.</detail><detail>Before applying a dressing, clean the wound thoroughly according to your provider's instructions.</detail><detail>You may be able to change your own dressing, or family members may be able to help. A visiting nurse may also help you. </detail></h2><h2 title="Prevention"><text>If you are at risk for ischemic ulcers, taking these steps may help prevent problems:</text><detail>Check your feet and legs every day. Check the tops and bottoms, ankles, heels, and between your toes. Look for changes in color and red or sore areas.</detail><detail>Wear shoes that fit properly and do not rub or put pressure on your feet. Wear socks that fit. Socks that are too big can bunch up in your shoes and cause rubbing or the skin, which can lead to a sore.</detail><detail>Try not to sit or stand too long in one position.</detail><detail>Protect your feet from the cold.</detail><detail>DO NOT walk barefoot. Protect your feet from injury.</detail><detail>DO NOT wear compression stockings or wraps unless told to by your provider. These may restrict blood flow.</detail><detail>DO NOT soak your feet in hot water.</detail><text>Certain lifestyle changes can help prevent ischemic ulcers. If you have a wound, taking these steps can improve blood flow and aid healing.</text><detail>Quit smoking. Smoking can lead to clogged arteries.</detail><detail>If you have diabetes, keep your blood sugar level under control. This will help you heal faster.</detail><detail>Exercise as much as you can. Staying active can help with blood flow.</detail><detail>Eat healthy foods and get plenty of sleep at night.</detail><detail>Lose weight if you are overweight.</detail><detail>Manage your blood pressure and cholesterol levels.</detail></h2><h2 title="When to Call the Doctor"><text>Call your provider if there are any signs of infection, such as:</text><detail>Redness, increased warmth, or swelling around the wound</detail><detail>More drainage than before or drainage that is yellowish or cloudy</detail><detail>Bleeding</detail><detail>Odor</detail><detail>Fever or chills</detail><detail>Increased pain</detail></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>Arterial ulcers - self-care; Arterial insufficiency ulcer self-care; Ischemic wounds - self-care; Peripheral artery disease - ulcer; Peripheral vascular disease - ulcer; PVD - ulcer; PAD - ulcer</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 4/5/2018"><text>Updated by: Michael Sobel, MD, Professor of Vascular Surgery, University of Washington, Seattle.

These may include fatty or fried foods, dairy products, caffeine, sodas, alcohol, chocolate, and grains such as wheat, rye, and barley.</detail><detail>Eat 4 to 5 smaller meals a day, rather than 3 larger ones. </detail><text>Increase the fiber in your diet to relieve symptoms of constipation. Fiber is found in whole grain breads and cereals, beans, fruits, and vegetables. Since fiber may cause gas, it is best to add these foods to your diet slowly.</text></h2><h2 title="Medicines"><text>No one drug will work for everyone. Medicines your provider may have you try include:</text><detail>Antispasmodic medicines that you take before eating to control colon muscle spasms and abdominal cramping</detail><detail>Antidiarrheal medicines such as loperamide</detail><detail>Laxatives, such as lubiprostone, bisacodyl , and other ones bought without a prescription</detail><detail>Antidepressants to help relieve pain or discomfort</detail><detail>Rifaximin, an antibiotic that is not absorbed from your intestines </detail><text>It is very important to follow your provider's instructions when using medicines for IBS. Taking different medicines or not taking medicines the way you have been advised can lead to more problems.</text></h2><h2 title="Stress"><text>Stress may cause your intestines to be more sensitive and contract more. Many things can cause stress, including: </text><detail>Not being able to do activities because of your pain</detail><detail>Changes or problems at work or at home</detail><detail>A busy schedule</detail><detail>Spending too much time alone</detail><detail>Having other medical problems </detail><text>A first step toward reducing your stress is to figure out what makes you feel stressed.</text><detail>Look at the things in your life that cause you the most worry.</detail><detail>Keep a diary of the experiences and thoughts that seem to be related to your anxiety and see if you can make changes to these situations.</detail><detail>Reach out to other people.</detail><detail>Find someone you trust (such as a friend, family member, neighbor, or clergy member) who will listen to you. Often, just talking to someone helps relieve anxiety and stress. </detail></h2><h2 title="When to Call the Doctor"><text>Call your provider if:</text><detail>You develop a fever</detail><detail>You have gastrointestinal bleeding</detail><detail>You have bad pain that does not go away</detail><detail>You lose over 5 to 10 pounds (2 to 4.5 kilograms) when you are not trying to lose weight </detail></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>IBS; Mucus colitis; IBS-D; IBS-C</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 4/24/2017"><text>Updated by: Michael M.

<item><title>Integrative medicine for cancer treatment</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000932.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>When you have cancer, you want to do all you can to treat the cancer and feel better. This is why many people turn to integrative medicine. Integrative medicine (IM) refers to any type of medical practice or product that is not standard care. It includes things like acupuncture, meditation, and massage. Standard care for cancer includes surgery, chemotherapy, radiation, and biological therapy. </text><text>Integrative medicine is complementary care used alongside standard care. It combines the best of both types of care. IM encourages shared decision making between providers and patients. This is when patients take an active role in their care as a partner with their provider.</text><text>Note that some types of IM may help manage cancer symptoms and side effects of treatment, but none have been proven to treat cancer.</text></h2><h2 title="Talk With Your Doctor First"><text>Before using any type of IM, you should talk with your health care provider first. This includes taking vitamins and other supplements. Some treatments that are usually safe can be risky for people with cancer. For example, St. John's wort can interfere with some cancer drugs. And high doses of vitamin C can affect how well radiation and chemotherapy work. </text><text>Also, not all therapies work the same for everyone. Your provider can help you decide if a specific treatment might help you rather than causing potential harm.</text></h2><h2 title="When IM Can Help"><text>IM may help relieve common side effects of cancer or cancer treatment, such as fatigue, anxiety, pain, and nausea. Some cancer centers even offer these therapies as part of their care. </text><text>Many types of IM have been studied. Those that may help people with cancer include:</text><detail>Acupuncture. This ancient Chinese practice may help relieve nausea and vomiting. It also may help ease cancer pain and hot flashes. Be sure your acupuncturist uses sterile needles, since cancer puts you at higher risk for infection.</detail><detail>Aromatherapy. This treatment uses fragrant oils to improve health or mood. It also may help ease pain, nausea, stress, and depression. Although generally safe, these oils can cause allergic reactions, headaches, and nausea in some people.</detail><detail>Massage therapy. This type of bodywork may help relieve anxiety, nausea, pain, and depression. Before you have massage therapy, ask your health care provider if the therapist should avoid any areas of your body.</detail><detail>Meditation. Practicing meditation has been shown to ease anxiety, fatigue, stress, and sleep problems.</detail><detail>Ginger. This herb may help ease the nausea of cancer treatment when it is used with standard anti-nausea medicines.</detail><detail>Yoga. This ancient mind-body practice may help relieve stress, anxiety, and depression. Before doing yoga, be sure to check with your health care provider to see if there are any poses or kinds of classes you should avoid.</detail><detail>Biofeedback. This therapy may help ease the pain of cancer. It also may help with sleeping problems. </detail><text>In general, these therapies are safe for most people and pose little health risk. But before using them, you should always ask your provider if they are safe for you.</text></h2><h2 title="The Limits of IM"><text>Currently, no types of IM have been shown to help cure or treat cancer. While many products and treatments are touted as cures for cancer, there are no studies that back up these claims. Before trying any product that makes such claims, talk with your provider first. Some products can interfere with other cancer treatments. </text></h2><h2 title="Finding an IM Practitioner"><text>If you want to try an IM treatment, choose your practitioner wisely. Here are some tips:</text><detail>Ask your health care providers or cancer center if they can help you find a practitioner.</detail><detail>Ask about the practitioner's training and certification.</detail><detail>Make sure the person has a license to practice the treatment in your state.</detail><detail>Look for a practitioner who has worked with people with your type of cancer and who is willing to work with your provider on your treatment. </detail></h2><h2 title="Review Date 1/31/2018"><text>Updated by: Todd Gersten, MD, Hematology/Oncology, Florida Cancer Specialists &amp;amp; Research Institute, Wellington, FL.

<item><title>Insulin and syringes - storage and safety</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000962.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>If you use insulin therapy, you need to know how to store insulin so that it keeps its potency (does not stop working). Disposing of syringes safely helps protect people around you from injury.</text></h2><h2 title="Information"><text>INSULIN STORAGE</text><text>Insulin is sensitive to temperature and light. Sunlight and temperatures that are too hot or too cold can affect how well insulin works. This could explain changes in blood glucose control. Proper storage will keep insulin stable.</text><text>Your provider may suggest storing the insulin that you are using now at room temperature. This will make it more comfortable to inject.</text><text>Below are general tips for storing insulin. Be sure to follow the manufacturer’s instructions for the insulin.</text><detail>Store opened insulin bottles or reservoirs or pens at a room temperature of 59°F to 86°F (15°C to 30°C).</detail><detail>You can store most opened insulin at room temperature for a maximum of 28 days.</detail><detail>Keep insulin away from direct heat and sunlight (do not keep it on your windowsill or on the dashboard in your car).</detail><detail>Discard insulin 28 days from the date of opening. </detail><text>Any unopened bottles should be kept in a refrigerator.</text><detail>Store unopened insulin in the refrigerator at a temperature between 36°F to 46°F (2°C to 8°C).</detail><detail>Do not freeze insulin (some insulin can freeze at the back of the refrigerator). Do not use insulin that has been frozen.</detail><detail>You can store insulin until the expiration date on the label. This can be up to one year (as listed by the manufacturer).</detail><detail>Always check the expiration date before using insulin. </detail><text>For insulin pumps, recommendations include:</text><detail>Insulin removed from its original vial (for pump use) should be used within 2 weeks and discarded thereafter.</detail><detail>Insulin stored in the reservoir or infusion set of an insulin pump should be discarded after 48 hours, even if it is stored at the proper temperature.</detail><detail>Discard insulin if the storage temperature goes above 98.6°F (37°C). </detail><text>HANDLING INSULIN</text><text>Before using insulin (vials or cartridges), follow the instructions below:</text><detail>Wash your hands well.</detail><detail>Mix the insulin by rolling the vial between your palms.</detail><detail>Do not shake the container as it can cause air bubbles. </detail><text>Before using, check the insulin to make sure it is clear. Do not use if the insulin is:</text><detail>Beyond its expiration date</detail><detail>Unclear, discolored, or cloudy (Note that certain insulin [NPH or N] is expected to be cloudy after you mix it)</detail><detail>Crystallized or has small lumps or particles</detail><detail>Frozen</detail><detail>Viscous</detail><detail>Bad smelling </detail><text>SYRINGE AND PEN NEEDLE SAFETY</text><text>Syringes are made for single use. However, some people reuse syringes to save costs and reduce waste. Talk with your health care provider before you reuse syringes to see if it is safe for you. DO NOT reuse if:</text><detail>You have an open wound on your hands</detail><detail>You are prone to infections</detail><detail>You are ill </detail><text>If you do reuse syringes, follow these suggestions:</text><detail>Recap after every use.</detail><detail>Make sure the needle touches only the insulin and your clean skin.</detail><detail>Do not share syringes.</detail><detail>Store syringes at room temperature.</detail><detail>Using alcohol to clean the syringe may remove the coating that helps the syringe easily enter the skin. </detail><text>SYRINGE OR PEN NEEDLE DISPOSAL</text><text>Safely disposing of syringes or pen needles is important to help protect others from injury or infection. The best method is to have a small 'sharps' container in your house, car, purse or backpack. There are many places to get these containers (see below). </text><text>Dispose of needles right after use. If you reuse needles, you should dispose of the syringe if the needle:</text><detail>Is dull or bent</detail><detail>Touches anything other than clean skin or the insulin </detail><text>There are different options for syringe disposal depending on where you live. These may include:</text><detail>Drop-off collection or household hazardous waste collection sites where you can take discarded syringes</detail><detail>Special waste pick-up services</detail><detail>Mail-back programs</detail><detail>Home needle destruction devices </detail><text>You can call your local trash or public health department to find out the best way to dispose of syringes. Or check out the U.S. Food and Drug Administration webpage Safely Using Sharps -- www.fda.gov/medicaldevices/productsandmedicalprocedures/homehealthandconsumer/consumerproducts/sharps/default.htm for more information on where to dispose of syringes in your area.</text><text>Here are some general guidelines for disposal of syringes:</text><detail>You can destroy the syringe using a needle clipping device. Do not use scissors or other implements.</detail><detail>Recap needles that have not been destroyed.</detail><detail>Place syringes and needles in a 'sharps' disposal container. You can get these at pharmacies, medical supply companies, or online. Check with your insurer to see if the cost is covered.</detail><detail>If a sharps container is not available, you may be able to use a heavy-duty puncture-resistant plastic bottle (not clear) with a screw top. Used laundry detergent bottles work well. Be sure to label the container as 'sharps waste.'</detail><detail>Follow your local community guidelines for disposing of sharps waste.</detail><detail>NEVER throw syringes in the recycle bin or loose in the trash.</detail><detail>Do NOT flush syringes or needles down the toilet. </detail></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>Diabetes - insulin storage</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 8/19/2018"><text>Updated by: Brent Wisse, MD, Associate Professor of Medicine, Division of Metabolism, Endocrinology &amp;amp; Nutrition, University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle, WA.

<item><title>Inguinal hernia repair - discharge</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000274.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>You or your child had surgery to repair an inguinal hernia caused by a weakness in the abdominal wall in your groin area.</text><text>Now that you or your child is going home, follow the surgeon's instructions on self-care at home.</text></h2><h2 title="When You're in the Hospital"><text>During surgery, you or your child had anesthesia. This may have been general (asleep and pain-free) or spinal or epidural (numb from the waist down) anesthesia. If the hernia was small, it was likely repaired under local anesthesia (awake but pain-free).</text><text>The nurse will give you or your child pain medicine and help you or your child begin to move around. Rest and gentle movement are important for recovery.</text><text>You or your child may go home the same day as surgery. Or the hospital stay may be 1 to 2 days. It will depend on the procedure that was done.</text></h2><h2 title="What to Expect at Home"><text>After hernia repair:</text><detail>If there are stitches on the skin, they will need to be removed at a follow-up visit with the surgeon. If stitches under the skin were used, they will dissolve on their own.</detail><detail>The incision is covered with a bandage. Or, it is covered with a liquid adhesive (skin glue).</detail><detail>You or your child may have pain, soreness, and stiffness at first, especially when moving about. This is normal.</detail><detail>You or your child will also feel tired after surgery. This can last for a few weeks.</detail><detail>You or your child will most likely return to normal activities in just a few weeks.</detail><detail>Men may have swelling and pain in their testicles.</detail><detail>There may be some bruising around the groin and testicular area.</detail><detail>You or your child may have trouble passing urine for the first few days. </detail><text>Make sure you or your child gets plenty of rest the first 2 to 3 days after going home. Ask family and friends for help with daily activities while your movements are limited.</text></h2><h2 title="Managing Pain"><text>Use any pain medicines as instructed by the surgeon or nurse. You may be given a prescription for a narcotic pain medicine. Over-the-counter pain medicine (ibuprofen, acetaminophen) can be used if the narcotic medicine is too strong.</text><text>Apply a cold compress to the incision area for 15 to 20 minutes at a time for the first few days. This will help the pain and swelling. Wrap the compress or ice in a towel. This helps prevent cold injury to the skin.</text></h2><h2 title="Wound Care"><text>There may be a bandage over the incision. Follow the surgeon's instructions for how long to leave it on and when to change it. If skin glue was used, a bandage may not have been used. </text><detail>A little bleeding and drainage is normal for the first few days. Apply antibiotic ointment (bacitracin, polysporin) or another solution to the incision area if the surgeon or nurse told you to.</detail><detail>Wash the area with mild soap and water when the surgeon says it is OK to do so. Gently pat it dry. DO NOT take a bath, soak in a hot tub, or go swimming for the first week after surgery. </detail></h2><h2 title="Diet During Recovery"><text>Pain medicines can cause constipation. Eating some high-fiber foods and drinking plenty of water can help keep the bowels moving. Use over the counter fiber products if constipation does not improve.</text><text>Antibiotics can cause diarrhea. If this happens, try eating yogurt with live cultures or taking psyllium (Metamucil). Call the surgeon if the diarrhea does not get better.</text></h2><h2 title="Activity for Adults"><text>Give yourself time to heal. You may gradually resume normal activities, such as walking, driving, and sexual activity, when you are ready. But you probably will not feel like doing anything strenuous for a few weeks.</text><text>DO NOT drive if you are taking narcotic pain medicines.</text><text>DO NOT lift anything over 10 pounds or 4.5 kilograms (about a gallon or 4 liters jug of milk) for 4 to 6 weeks, or until your doctor tells you it is OK. If possible avoid doing any activity that causes pain, or pulls on the area of surgery. Older boys and men may want to wear an athletic supporter if they have swelling or pain in the testicles.</text><text>Check with the surgeon before returning to sports or other high-impact activities. Protect the incision area from the sun for 1 year to prevent noticeable scarring.</text></h2><h2 title="Activity for Children"><text>Toddlers and older children will often stop any activity if they get tired. DO NOT press them to do more if they seem tired.</text><text>The surgeon or nurse will tell you when it is OK for your child to return to school or daycare. This may be as soon as 2 to 3 weeks after surgery.</text><text>Ask the surgeon or nurse if there are certain activities or sports your child should not do, and for how long.</text></h2><h2 title="Follow-up"><text>Schedule a follow-up appointment with the surgeon as directed. Usually this visit is about 2 weeks after surgery.</text></h2><h2 title="When to Call the Doctor"><text>Call the surgeon if you or your child has any of the following:</text><detail>Severe pain or soreness</detail><detail>A lot of bleeding from your incision</detail><detail>Difficulty breathing</detail><detail>Light headedness that does not go away after a few days</detail><detail>Chills, or fever of 101°F (38.3°C), or higher</detail><detail>Warmth, or redness at the incision site</detail><detail>Trouble urinating</detail><detail>Swelling or pain in the testicles that is getting worse </detail></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>Hernioraphy - discharge; Hernioplasty - discharge</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 2/11/2017"><text>Updated by: Debra G.

The provider will cut the part of the nail that has grown into the skin of the toe. Either part of the nail or the entire nail will have been removed.</text><text>The surgery took an hour or less and your provider has covered the wound with a bandage. You can go home the same day.</text></h2><h2 title="What to Expect at Home"><text>You may feel pain once the pain-numbing medicine wears off. Take the pain reliever your provider recommends.</text><text>You may notice:</text><detail>Some swelling in your foot </detail><detail>Light bleeding</detail><detail>A yellow-colored discharge from the wound </detail><text>At home you should:</text><detail>Keep your feet raised above the level of your heart to reduce swelling</detail><detail>Rest your foot and avoid moving it</detail><detail>Keep your wound clean and dry </detail></h2><h2 title="Dressing"><text>Change the dressing about 12 to 24 hours after the surgery. Follow your provider's instructions for changing the dressing. Your provider may recommend soaking your foot in warm water before removing the dressing. This helps the bandage not stick to the wound. </text><text>Change the dressing once or twice a day or as suggested by your provider.</text></h2><h2 title="Foot Bath"><text>Soak your feet 2 to 3 times a day in the bath containing:</text><detail>Epsom salts - to relieve swelling and inflammation</detail><detail>Betadine - an antibiotic to help reduce the risk of infection </detail><text>Dry your feet and apply antibiotic ointment your provider has given you. Dress the wound to keep it clean.</text></h2><h2 title="Activity"><text>Try to reduce activity and rest your foot. Avoid bumping your toe or putting a lot of pressure on it. You may want to wear open-toed shoes. If wearing closed shoes, make sure they are not too tight. Wear cotton socks. </text><text>You may need to do this for about 2 weeks. </text><text>You can likely resume your normal activities within a week. Getting back to sports may take a little longer. </text><text>Keep your wound covered both day and night in the first week. You can let your toe remain uncovered at night in the second week. This helps the wound heal.</text><text>See your provider again in 2 to 3 days or as recommended. </text></h2><h2 title="Prevention"><text>The toenail may grow inward again. To prevent this, follow these tips:</text><detail>Don't wear tight-fitting shoes or high heels</detail><detail>Don't trim your nails too short or round the corners</detail><detail>Don't pick or tear at the corners of the nails </detail></h2><h2 title="When to Call the Doctor"><text>Call your provider if you notice:</text><detail>Your toenail is not healing</detail><detail>Fever</detail><detail>Pain, even after taking pain-relief medicine</detail><detail>Bleeding from the toenail</detail><detail>Pus from the toenail</detail><detail>Swelling or redness of the toe or foot</detail><detail>Regrowth of the nail into the skin of the toe </detail></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>Onychocryptosis surgery; Onychomycosis; Unguis incarnates surgery; Ingrown toenail removal; Toenail </text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 12/10/2016"><text>Updated by: Linda J.

Not all medical treatments require written informed consent. </text></h2><h2 title="What Treatments Need Informed Consent?"><text>Medical procedures that may require you to give written informed consent include: </text><detail>Most surgeries, even when they are not done in the hospital</detail><detail>Other advanced or complex medical tests and procedures, such as an endoscopy (placing a tube down your throat to look at the inside of your stomach) or a needle biopsy of the liver</detail><detail>Radiation or chemotherapy to treat cancer</detail><detail>Most vaccines</detail><detail>Some blood tests, such as HIV testing (need for written consent varies by state) </detail></h2><h2 title="What Should Occur During the Informed Consent Process?"><text>When asking for your informed consent, your doctor or other health care provider must explain:</text><detail>If treatment is necessary now or if it can wait</detail><detail>Your health problem and the reason for the treatment</detail><detail>What happens during the treatment</detail><detail>The risks of the treatment and how likely they are to occur</detail><detail>How likely the treatment is to work</detail><detail>Other options for treating your health problem</detail><detail>Risks or possible side effects that may happen later on </detail><text>You should have enough information to make a decision about your treatment. Your provider should also make sure you understand the information. One way a provider may do this is by asking you to repeat the information back in your own words.</text><text>If you would like more details about your treatment choices, ask your provider where to look. There are many trusted websites and other resources your provider can give you.</text></h2><h2 title="What is Your Role in the Informed Consent Process?"><text>You are an important member of your health care team. You should ask questions about anything you do not understand. If you need your provider to explain something in a different way, ask them to do so.</text><text>You have the right to refuse treatment if you are able to understand your health condition, your treatment options, and the risks and benefits of each option. Your doctor or other health care provider may tell you they do not think this is the best choice for you. But, your providers should not try to force you to have a treatment you do not want to have.</text><text>It is important to be involved in the informed consent process.

In both cases, the person would not be able to understand information to decide what medical care they want. In these types of situations, the provider would try to obtain informed consent for treatment from a surrogate, or substitute decision-maker. </text><text>Even when your provider does not ask for your written consent, you should still be told what tests or treatments are being done and why. For example: </text><detail>Before they have the test, men should know the pros, cons, and the reasons for a PSA blood test that screens for prostate cancer.</detail><detail>Women should know the pros, cons, and the reasons for a Pap test, a mammogram, or other tests.</detail><detail>Anyone who is being tested for an infection that occurs after sexual contact should be told about the test and why they are being tested. </detail></h2><h2 title="Review Date 11/20/2017"><text>Updated by: Laura J.

It may be unsafe.</detail><detail>Store cans of powdered formula in a cool, dry place with a plastic lid on top.</detail><detail>DO NOT use outdated formula.</detail><detail>Always wash your hands and the top of the formula container before handling. Use a clean cup to measure the water.</detail><detail>Make the formula as directed. DO NOT water it down or make it stronger than recommended. This can cause pain, poor growth, or rarely, more severe problems in your baby. DO NOT add sugar to formula.</detail><detail>You can make enough formula to last for up to 24 hours.</detail><detail>Once the formula is made, store it in the refrigerator in individual bottles or a pitcher with a closed lid. During the first month, your baby may need at least 8 bottles of formula per day.</detail><detail>When you first buy bottles, boil them in a covered pan for 5 minutes. After that, you can clean bottles and nipples with soap and warm water. Use a special bottle and nipple brush to get at hard-to-reach places. </detail></h2><h2 title="Feeding Formula to Baby"><text>Here is a guide to feeding your baby formula:</text><detail>You do not need to warm formula before feeding. You can feed your baby cool or room-temperature formula.</detail><detail>If your baby prefers warm formula, warm it slowly by placing it in hot water. DO NOT boil the water and DO NOT use a microwave. Always test the temperature on yourself before feeding your baby.</detail><detail>Hold your child close to you and make eye contact while feeding. Hold the bottle so the nipple and the neck of the bottle are always filled with formula. This will help prevent your child from swallowing air.</detail><detail>Throw away leftover formula within 1 hour after a feeding. DO NOT keep it and use again. </detail></h2><h2 title="Review Date 5/14/2017"><text>Updated by: Neil K.

<item><title>Inducing labor</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000625.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>Inducing labor refers to different treatments used to either start or move your labor at a faster pace. The goal is to bring on contractions or to make them stronger.</text><text>Several methods can help get labor started.</text></h2><h2 title="Rupturing the Membranes"><text>Amniotic fluid is the water that surrounds your baby in the womb. It contains membranes or layers of tissue. One method of inducing labor is to "break the bag of waters" or rupture the membranes.</text><detail>Your health care provider will do a pelvic exam and will guide a small plastic probe with a hook on the end through your cervix to create a hole in the membrane. This does not hurt you or your baby.</detail><detail>Your cervix must already be dilated and the baby's head must have dropped down into your pelvis. </detail><text>Most of the time, contractions will begin within minutes to a few hours afterward. If labor does not begin after a few hours, you may receive a medicine through your veins to help start contractions. This is because the longer it takes for labor to start, the greater your chance of getting an infection.</text></h2><h2 title="Using Prostaglandins "><text>Early in your pregnancy your cervix should be firm, long, and closed. Before your cervix starts to dilate or open, it must first become soft and begin to "thin out."</text><text>For some, this process may begin before labor has started. But if your cervix has not begun to ripen or thin, your provider can use a medicine called prostaglandins.</text><text>The medicine is placed in your vagina next to your cervix. Prostaglandins will often ripen, or soften, the cervix, and contractions may even begin. Your baby's heart rate will be monitored for a few hours. If labor does not begin, you may be allowed to leave the hospital and walk around. </text></h2><h2 title="Oxytocin (Pitocin)"><text>Oxytocin is a medicine given through your veins (IV or intravenous) to either start your contractions or make them stronger. A small amount enters your body through the vein at a steady rate. The dose may be slowly increased as needed.</text><text>Your baby's heart rate and the strength of your contractions will be monitored closely.</text><detail>This is done to make sure your contractions are not so strong that they harm your baby.</detail><detail>Oxytocin may not be used if tests show that your unborn baby is not getting enough oxygen or food through the placenta.</detail><text>Oxytocin will often create regular contractions. Once your own body and uterus "kick in," your provider may be able to reduce the dose.</text></h2><h2 title="Why is it Done?"><text>There are many reasons why you may need labor induction.</text><text>The induction of labor may be started before any signs of labor are present when:</text><detail>The membranes or bag of waters breaks but labor has not begun (after your pregnancy has passed 34 to 36 weeks).</detail><detail>You pass your due date, most often when the pregnancy is between 41 and 42 weeks.</detail><detail>You have had a stillbirth in the past.</detail><detail>You have a condition such as high blood pressure or diabetes during pregnancy that may threaten the health of you or your baby. </detail><text>Oxytocin may also be started after a woman's labor has started, but her contractions have not been strong enough to dilate her cervix. </text></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>Labor induction; Pregnancy - inducing labor; Prostaglandin - inducing labor; Oxytocin - inducing labor</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 11/11/2016"><text>Updated by: Irina Burd, MD, PhD, Associate Professor of Gynecology and Obstetrics at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD.

<item><title>Indoor fitness routine</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000890.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>You don't need to go to a gym or buy fancy equipment to get exercise. You can do a full fitness routine right at home.</text></h2><h2 title="A Complete Workout"><text>To get a complete workout, your routine should include 3 parts:</text><detail>Aerobic exercise. This is any kind of exercise that uses the large muscles in your body and gets your heart beating faster.</detail><detail>Stretching exercises. These exercises stretch your muscles for better flexibility and range of motion in your joints.</detail><detail>Strength training. These exercises work your muscles to make them stronger and help build stronger bones. </detail><text>No matter what type of home workout you choose, try to make sure it includes exercises in each of these 3 groups.</text><text>If you have been inactive for a while or have a health condition, you should see your health care provider before starting an exercise program.</text></h2><h2 title="Circuit Training"><text>Circuit training is one type of routine you can do easily at home. It involves doing short bursts of strength training exercises using light weights. You switch from one muscle group to the next with no breaks in between. This is an aerobic exercise that gets your heart rate up.</text><text>Here is a sample circuit training routine you can do at home. For exercises with weights, start with 2 to 5 pound (lb), or 1 to 2.25 kg, hand weights and add more weight as you get stronger. If you DO NOT have hand weights, you can make your own by filling gallon (liter) milk jugs with water.</text><detail>Warm up. Get your blood flowing by walking in place. Add a dynamic stretch by bringing your knee high up to your chest as you walk. Warming up and stretching your muscles can help prevent some injuries. You should continue with your warm up until your body feels warm and you are just starting to sweat.</detail><detail>15 leg squats. Keeping your legs hip-width apart and your back flat, slowly bend your hips and knees until your thighs are parallel to the floor. Return to starting position.</detail><detail>15 shoulder raises. Stand straight with your feet about hip-width apart. Hold the weights in your hands by your sides. Exhale and lift your arms out to your sides to about the level of your shoulders. DO NOT bend your wrists. Lower slowly.</detail><detail>15 lunges. From a standing position, step forward on to one foot. Bend your front knee and lower your hips until your front thigh is almost parallel to the floor. Your back knee, ankle, and foot will also bend. Try to keep your back straight. Using your front leg, push back into the starting position. Repeat on the other side.</detail><detail>15 bicep curls. Stand with a weight in one hand. Keep your back straight. Slowly bend your elbow and bring your hand with the weight up toward your shoulder with your palms facing up. Keep your elbows at your sides. Release and repeat on the other side. You can also do both arms at the same time.</detail><detail>12 to 15 bent-knee pushups. Start on your hands and knees. Your hands should be right under your shoulders with your fingertips pointing forward. Keeping your body straight, slowly bend your elbows so your chest moves toward the floor. DO NOT let your back sag. Press into your arms to push yourself back up. If it is too hard to do from the floor, you can stand up and do pushups off the wall or kitchen counter until you gain enough strength to move to the floor.</detail><detail>15 crunches. Lie on your back with your feet flat and your knees bent. Your heels should be about a foot away from your butt. Cross your hands in front of your chest. Exhale, tighten your abdominal muscles, and slowly curl up so your head, shoulders, and upper back are off the mat. Keep your chin tucked close to your neck and your lower back on the flood. Hold for a moment and then release.</detail><text>Start by doing 1 round of this workout. As you get stronger, repeat this full cycle 2 or 3 times. To add an extra challenge, do 30 seconds of jumping jacks or running in place between each exercise.</text><text>You can do circuit training with any exercises you choose. Just be sure to hit all major muscle groups. If you DO NOT have weights, choose exercises that use your own body weight, such as squats and pushups. You can also use resistance bands. The idea is to keep moving and to work muscles from different areas.</text></h2><h2 title="How Often to Exercise"><text>Aim to do this workout 2 or 3 times a week. Make sure you have 1 full day of rest in between the days you work out. This gives your muscles time to recover. For the best results, you should be exercising at least 2 hours and 30 minutes a week.</text></h2><h2 title="For More Information"><text>The American Council on Exercise (ACE) has a number of exercise routines listed on the site -- www.acefitness.org/education-and-resources/lifestyle/exercise-library.</text><text>There are also many books on exercises you can do at home. You can also get fitness videos or DVDs. Choose books or videos created by people with fitness credentials, such as a being certified by ACE or the American College of Sports Medicine.</text></h2><h2 title="When to Call the Doctor"><text>Call your provider right away if you have any of the following symptoms during exercise:</text><detail>Pressure or pain in your chest, shoulder, arm, or neck</detail><detail>Feeling sick to your stomach</detail><detail>Severe pain</detail><detail>Trouble breathing or shortness of breath even when you stop exercise</detail><detail>Lightheadedness </detail></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>Fitness - indoors; Exercise - indoors</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 4/15/2018"><text>Updated by: Linda J.

<item><title>Implantable cardioverter defibrillator - discharge</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000108.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>An implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) is a device that detects a life-threatening, abnormal heartbeat. If it occurs, the device sends an electrical shock to the heart to change the rhythm back to normal. This article discusses what you need to know after you have had an ICD inserted.</text></h2><h2 title="When You're in the Hospital"><text>A type of heart specialist called an electrophysiologist or a surgeon made a small incision (cut) in your chest wall. A device called an ICD was inserted under your skin and muscle. The ICD is the size of a large cookie. Leads, or electrodes, were placed in your heart and were connected to your ICD.</text><text>The ICD can quickly detect life-threatening abnormal heartbeats (arrhythmias). It is designed to convert any abnormal heart rhythm back to normal by sending an electrical shock to your heart. This action is called defibrillation. This device can also work as a pacemaker.</text></h2><h2 title="What to Expect at Home"><text>When you leave the hospital, you will be given a card to keep in your wallet. This card lists the details of your ICD and has contact information for emergencies.</text><text>Carry your ICD identification card with you AT ALL TIMES. The information it contains will tell all health care providers you see what type of ICD you have. Not all ICDs are the same. You should know what type of ICD you have and which company made it. This can let other providers check the device to see if it works right.</text></h2><h2 title="Wound Care "><text>You should be able to do most of your normal activities within 3 to 4 days after surgery. But you will have some limits for up to 4 to 6 weeks.</text><text>DO NOT do these things for 2 to 3 weeks:</text><detail>Lift anything heavier than 10 to 15 pounds (4.5 to 7 kilograms)</detail><detail>Push, pull, or twist too much</detail><detail>Wear clothes that rub on the wound</detail><text>Keep your incision completely dry for 4 to 5 days. After that, you may take a shower and pat it dry. Always wash your hands before touching the wound.</text><text>For 4 to 6 weeks, DO NOT lift your arm higher than your shoulder on the side of your body where your ICD was placed.</text></h2><h2 title="Follow-up"><text>You will need to see your provider regularly for monitoring. Your doctor will make sure your ICD is working correctly and will check to see how many shocks it has sent and how much power is left in the battery. Your first follow-up visit will probably be about 1 month after your ICD is placed.</text><text>ICD batteries are designed to last 4 to 8 years. Regular checks of the battery are needed to see how much power it has left. You will need minor surgery to replace your ICD when the battery begins to run down.</text></h2><h2 title="Be Careful Around Things With Magnets "><text>Most devices will not interfere with your defibrillator, but some with strong magnetic fields might. Ask your provider if you have questions about any specific device.</text><text>Most appliances in your home are safe to be around. This includes your refrigerator, washer, dryer, toaster, blender, personal computer and fax machine, hair dryer, stove, CD player, remote controls, and microwave.</text><text>There are several devices you should keep at least 12 inches (30.5 centimeters) away from the site where your ICD is placed under your skin. These include:</text><detail>Battery-powered cordless tools (such as screwdrivers and drills)</detail><detail>Plug-in power tools (such as drills and table saws)</detail><detail>Electric lawnmowers and leaf blowers</detail><detail>Slot machines</detail><detail>Stereo speakers </detail><text>Tell all providers that you have an ICD. Some medical equipment may harm your ICD. Because MRI machines have powerful magnets, talk to your doctor before having an MRI.</text><text>Stay away from large motors, generators, and equipment. DO NOT lean over the open hood of a running car. Also stay away from:</text><detail>Radio transmitters and high-voltage power lines</detail><detail>Products that use magnetic therapy, such as some mattresses, pillows, and massagers</detail><detail>Electrical or gasoline-powered appliances </detail><text>If you have a cell phone:</text><detail>DO NOT put it in a pocket on the same side of your body as your ICD.</detail><detail>When using your cell phone, hold it to your ear on the opposite side of your body. </detail><text>Be careful around metal detectors and security wands.</text><detail>Handheld security wands may interfere with your ICD. Show your wallet card and ask to be hand searched.</detail><detail>Most security gates at airports and stores are okay. But DO NOT stand near these devices for long periods. Your ICD may set off alarms. </detail></h2><h2 title="When to Call the Doctor"><text>Tell your provider about every shock you feel from your ICD. The settings of your ICD may need to be adjusted, or your medicines may need to be changed.</text><text>Also call if:</text><detail>Your wound looks infected. Signs of infection are redness, increased drainage, swelling, and pain.</detail><detail>You are having the symptoms you had before your ICD was implanted.</detail><detail>You are dizzy, have chest pain, or are short of breath.</detail><detail>You have hiccups that DO NOT go away.</detail><detail>You were unconscious for a moment.</detail><detail>Your ICD has sent a shock and you still DO NOT feel well or you pass out. Talk to your provider about when to call the office or 911. </detail></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>ICD - discharge; Defibrillation - discharge; Arrhythmia - ICD discharge; Abnormal heart rhythm - ICD discharge; Ventricular fibrillation - ICD discharge; VF - ICD discharge; V Fib - ICD discharge</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 8/2/2016"><text>Updated by: Michael A.

As the blood backs up the vagina, it causes:</text><detail>Mass or fullness in the lower part of the belly (from the build up of blood that can't come out)</detail><detail>Stomach pain</detail><detail>Back pain</detail><detail>Problems with urinating and bowel movements</detail><text>The provider will do a pelvic exam. The provider may also do a pelvic ultrasound and imaging studies of the kidneys. This is done to ensure that the problem is imperforate hymen rather than another problem. The provider may recommend that the girl see a specialist to make sure that the diagnosis is imperforate hymen.</text></h2><h2 title="Treatment"><text>A minor surgery can fix an imperforate hymen. The surgeon makes a small cut or incision and removes the extra hymen membrane.</text><detail>Girls who are diagnosed with imperforate hymen as babies most often have surgery when they are older and have just started puberty. The surgery is done in early puberty when breast development and pubic hair growth has begun.</detail><detail>Girls who are diagnosed when they are older have the same surgery. The surgery allows retained menstrual blood to leave the body. </detail><text>Girls recover from this surgery in a few days.</text><text>After surgery, the girl may have to insert dilators into the vagina for 15 minutes each day. A dilator looks like a tampon. This keeps the incision from closing on itself and keeps the vagina open.</text></h2><h2 title="After Treatment"><text>After girls recover from the surgery, they will have normal periods. They can use tampons, have normal sexual intercourse, and have children.</text></h2><h2 title="When to Call the Doctor"><text>Call the provider if:</text><detail>There are signs of infection after surgery, such as pain, pus, or fever.</detail><detail>The hole in the vagina seems to be closing. The dilator will not go in or there is a lot of pain when it is inserted. </detail></h2><h2 title="Review Date 1/14/2018"><text>Updated by: John D.

<item><title>Immunotherapy for cancer</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000903.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>Immunotherapy is a type of cancer treatment that relies on the body's infection-fighting system (immune system). It uses substances made by the body or in a lab to help the immune system work harder or in a more targeted way to fight cancer. This helps your body get rid of cancer cells. </text><text>Immunotherapy works by:</text><detail>Stopping or slowing the growth of cancer cells</detail><detail>Preventing cancer from spreading to other parts of the body</detail><detail>Boosting the immune system's ability to get rid of cancer cells </detail><text>There are several types of immunotherapy for cancer. </text></h2><h2 title="Monoclonal Antibodies"><text>The immune system protects the body from infection. It does this by detecting germs such as bacteria or viruses and making proteins that fight infection. These proteins are called antibodies. </text><text>Scientists can make special antibodies in a lab that seek out cancer cells instead of bacteria. Called monoclonal antibodies, they are also a type of targeted therapy. </text><text>Some monoclonal antibodies work by sticking to cancer cells. This makes it easier for other cells made by the immune system to find, attack, and kill the cells. </text><text>Other monoclonal antibodies work by blocking signals on the surface of the cancer cell that tell it to divide. </text><text>Another type of monoclonal antibody carries radiation or a chemotherapy drug to cancer cells. These cancer-killing substances are attached to the monoclonal antibodies, which then deliver the toxins to the cancer cells. </text><text>Monoclonal antibodies treat several different types of cancer:</text><detail>Non-Hodgkin lymphoma</detail><detail>Hodgkin lymphoma</detail><detail>Chronic lymphocytic leukemia</detail><detail>Anaplastic large cell lymphoma</detail><detail>Advanced melanoma</detail><detail>Stomach cancer</detail><detail>Breast cancer</detail><detail>Advanced colon or rectal cancer</detail><detail>Kidney cancer</detail><detail>Certain types of brain cancer</detail><detail>Cancers of the head and neck </detail></h2><h2 title="Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors"><text>"Checkpoints" are specific molecules on certain immune cells that the immune system either turns on or turns off to create an immune response. Cancer cells can use these checkpoints to avoid being attacked by the immune system.</text><text>Immune checkpoint inhibitors are a newer type of monoclonal antibody that act on these checkpoints to boost the immune system so it can attack cancer cells. </text><text>PD-1 inhibitors are used to treat:</text><detail>Melanoma of the skin</detail><detail>Non-small cell lung cancer</detail><detail>Kidney cancer</detail><detail>Hodgkin lymphoma</detail><detail>Stomach cancer</detail><detail>Liver cancer</detail><detail>Head and neck cancer </detail><text>PD-L1 inhibitors treat bladder cancer, lung cancer, and Merkel cell carcinoma, and are being tested against other types of cancer.</text><text>Drugs that target CTLA-4 treat melanoma of the skin.</text></h2><h2 title="Non-specific Immunotherapies"><text>These therapies boost the immune system in more general way than monoclonal antibodies. There are two main types: </text><text>Interleukin-2 (IL-2) helps immune cells grow and divide more quickly. A lab-made version of IL-2 is used for advanced forms of kidney cancer and melanoma. </text><text>Interferon alpha (INF-alfa) makes certain immune cells better able to attack cancer cells. It is rarely used to treat:</text><detail>Hairy cell leukemia</detail><detail>Chronic myelogenous leukemia</detail><detail>Follicular non-Hodgkin lymphoma</detail><detail>Cutaneous (skin) T-cell lymphoma</detail><detail>Kidney cancer</detail><detail>Melanoma</detail><detail>Kaposi sarcoma </detail></h2><h2 title="Vaccine-Based Immuno therapy "><text>This type of therapy uses viruses that have been altered in a lab to infect and kill cancer cells. When these cells die, they release substances called antigens. These antigens tell the immune system to target and kill other cancer cells in the body.</text><text>This type of immunotherapy is still in the very early stages of development.</text><text>Currently this type of therapy is used to treat advanced prostate cancer. It is being tested on other types of cancer.</text></h2><h2 title="Side Effects of Immunotherapy "><text>The side effects for different types of immunotherapy for cancer differ by the type of treatment. Some side effects occur where the injection or IV enters the body, causing the area to be:</text><detail>Sore or painful</detail><detail>Swollen</detail><detail>Red</detail><detail>Itchy </detail><text>Other possible side effects include:</text><detail>Flu-like symptoms (fever, chills, weakness, headache)</detail><detail>Nausea and vomiting</detail><detail>Diarrhea</detail><detail>Muscle or joint aches</detail><detail>Feeling very tired</detail><detail>Headache</detail><detail>Low or high blood pressure</detail><detail>Inflammation of the liver, lungs, endocrine organs, gastrointestinal tract, or skin </detail><text>These therapies can also cause a severe, sometimes fatal, allergic reaction in people sensitive to certain ingredients in the treatment. However, this is very rare. </text></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>Biological therapy; Biotherapy</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 1/31/2018"><text>Updated by: Todd Gersten, MD, Hematology/Oncology, Florida Cancer Specialists &amp;amp; Research Institute, Wellington, FL.

<item><title>Immunizations - diabetes</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000331.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>Immunizations (vaccines or vaccinations) help protect you from some diseases. When you have diabetes, you're more likely to get infections because your immune system doesn't work as well. Vaccines can prevent illnesses that can be very serious and can put you in the hospital.</text><text>Vaccines have an inactive, small, amount of a certain germ. This germ is often a virus or bacteria. After you get a vaccine, your body learns to attack the virus or bacteria if you get it again. This means you have less of a chance of getting sick than if you did not get the vaccine. Or you may just have a milder illness.</text><text>Below are some of the vaccines you need to know about. Ask your health care provider which are right for you.</text></h2><h2 title="Pneumococcal Vaccine"><text>Pneumococcal vaccine can help protect you from serious infections due to the pneumococcal bacteria. These infections include:</text><detail>In the blood (bacteremia)</detail><detail>Of the covering of the brain (meningitis)</detail><detail>In the lungs (pneumonia) </detail><text>You need at least one shot. A second shot may be needed if you had the first shot more than 5 years ago and you are now over age 65.</text><text>Most people have no or only minor side effects from the vaccine. You may have some pain and redness at the site where you get the shot.</text><text>This vaccine has a very small chance of a serious reaction or even death.</text></h2><h2 title="Flu Shot "><text>The flu (influenza) vaccine helps protect you from the flu. Each year, the type of flu virus that makes people sick is different. This is why you should get a flu shot every year. The best time to get the shot is in the early fall, so that you'll be protected all flu season, which usually lasts until the following March.</text><text>People with diabetes who are 6 months or older should get the flu vaccine each year.</text><text>The vaccine is given as a shot (injection). Flu shots can be given to healthy people 6 months or older. One type of shot is injected into a muscle (often the upper arm muscle). Another type is injected just under the skin. Your provider can tell you which shot is right for you.</text><text>In general, you should not get a flu shot if you:</text><detail>Have a severe allergy to chickens or egg protein</detail><detail>Have a fever or illness that is more than "just a cold"</detail><detail>Had a bad reaction to a previous flu vaccine </detail><text>This vaccine has a very small chance of a serious reaction or even death.</text></h2><h2 title="Hepatitis B Vaccine"><text>The hepatitis B vaccine helps protect you from getting a liver infection due to the hepatitis B virus. People with diabetes ages 19 through 59 should get the vaccine. Your doctor can tell you if this vaccine is right for you.</text></h2><h2 title="Other Important Vaccines"><text>Other vaccines that you may need are:</text><detail>Hepatitis A</detail><detail>Tdap (tetanus, diphtheria and pertussis)</detail><detail>MMR (measles, mumps, rubella)</detail><detail>Herpes zoster (shingles)</detail><detail>Polio</detail></h2><h2 title="Review Date 8/7/2016"><text>Updated by: Brent Wisse, MD, Associate Professor of Medicine, Division of Metabolism, Endocrinology &amp;amp; Nutrition, University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle, WA.

<item><title>Iliotibial band syndrome - aftercare</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000683.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>The iliotibial band (ITB) is a tendon that runs along the outside of your leg. It connects from the top of your pelvic bone to just below your knee. A tendon is thick elastic tissue that connects muscle to bone.</text><text>Iliotibial band syndrome occurs when the ITB becomes swollen and irritated from rubbing against the bone on the outside of your hip or knee.</text></h2><h2 title="More About Your Injury"><text>There is a water-filled sac, called a bursa, between the bone and the tendon on the outside part of your leg. The rubbing of the tendon can cause pain and swelling of the bursa, the tendon, or both.</text><text>This injury often affects runners and cyclists. Bending the knee over and over during these activities can create irritation and swelling of the tendon.</text><text>Other causes include:</text><detail>Being in poor physical condition</detail><detail>Having a tight ITB</detail><detail>Poor form with your activities</detail><detail>Not warming up before exercising</detail><detail>Having bowed legs</detail><detail>Changes in activity levels </detail></h2><h2 title="What to Expect"><text>If you have ITB syndrome you may notice:</text><detail>Mild pain on the outside of your knee or hip when you begin to exercise, which goes away as you warm up.</detail><detail>Over time the pain feels worse and doesn't go away during exercise.</detail><detail>Running down hills or sitting for a long time with your knee bent may make pain worse. </detail><text>Your doctor will examine your knee and move your leg in different positions to see if your ITB is tight. Usually, ITB syndrome can be diagnosed from the exam and your description of the symptoms.</text><text>If imaging tests are needed, they may include any of the following:</text><detail>Ultrasound</detail><detail>MRI</detail><text>If you have ITB syndrome, treatment may involve any of the following:</text><detail>Medicines or applying ice to relieve pain</detail><detail>Stretching and strengthening exercises</detail><detail>A shot of medicine called cortisone in the painful area to relieve pain and swelling</detail><text>Most people do not need surgery. But if other treatments do not work, surgery may be recommended. During surgery, part of your ITB, the bursa, or both will be removed. Or, the ITB will be lengthened. This prevents the ITB from rubbing against the bone at the side of your knee.</text></h2><h2 title="Symptom Relief"><text>At home, follow these measures to help reduce pain and swelling:</text><detail>Apply ice to the painful area for 15 minutes every two to three hours. DO NOT apply ice directly to your skin. Wrap the ice in a clean cloth first.</detail><detail>Apply heat before stretching or doing strengthening exercises.</detail><detail>Take pain medicine if you need to. </detail><text>For pain, you can use ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn), or acetaminophen (Tylenol). You can buy these pain medicines at the store. </text><detail>Talk with your doctor before using any pain medicines if you have heart disease, high blood pressure, kidney disease, or have had stomach ulcers or internal bleeding in the past.</detail><detail>DO NOT take more than the amount recommended on the bottle or by your doctor. </detail></h2><h2 title="Activity"><text>Try running or cycling shorter distances than you usually do. If you still have pain, avoid these activities completely. You may need to do other exercises that do not irritate your ITB, such as swimming.</text><text>Try wearing a bandage or knee sleeve to keep the bursa and ITB warm while you exercise.</text><text>Your doctor may recommend a physical therapist (PT) to work with your specific injury so you can return to normal activity as soon as possible. </text><text>Your PT may recommend ways to change how you exercise to prevent problems. You may also be fitted for arch supports (orthotics) to wear in your shoes.</text><text>Once you can do stretching and strengthening exercises without pain, you can gradually begin running or cycling again. Slowly build up distance and speed.</text></h2><h2 title="Self-care at Home"><text>Your PT may give you exercises to do to help stretch your ITB and strengthen your leg muscles. Before and after activity:</text><detail>Use a heating pad on your knee to warm the area up. Make sure the pad's setting is on low or medium.</detail><detail>Ice your knee and take pain medicine after activity if you feel pain. </detail><text>The best way for the tendons to heal is to stick to a care plan. The more you rest and practice physical therapy, the quicker and better your injury will heal. </text></h2><h2 title="When to Call the Doctor"><text>Call your health care provider if pain gets worse or does not get better in a few weeks.</text></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>IT band syndrome - aftercare; ITB syndrome - aftercare; Iliotibial band friction syndrome - aftercare</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 4/18/2017"><text>Updated by: C.

<item><title>Ileostomy and your diet</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000070.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>You had an injury or disease in your digestive system and needed an operation called an ileostomy. The operation changed the way your body gets rid of waste (stool, feces, or poop).</text><text>Now you have an opening called a stoma in your belly. Waste will pass through the stoma into a pouch that collects it. You will need to take care of the stoma and empty the pouch many times a day.</text><text>People who have had an ileostomy can most often eat a normal diet. But some foods may cause problems. Foods that may be fine for some people may cause trouble for others.</text></h2><h2 title="Self-care"><text>Your pouch should be sealed well enough to prevent any odor from leaking. You may notice more odor when you empty your pouch after you eat certain foods. Some of these foods are onions, garlic, broccoli, asparagus, cabbage, fish, some cheeses, eggs, baked beans, Brussels sprouts, and alcohol.</text><text>Doing these things will keep down the odor:</text><detail>Eating parsley, yogurt, and buttermilk.</detail><detail>Keeping your ostomy devices clean.</detail><detail>Using special deodorants or adding vanilla oil or peppermint extract to your pouch before closing it. Ask your health care provider about this. </detail><text>Control gas, if it is a problem:</text><detail>Eat on a regular schedule.</detail><detail>Eat slowly.</detail><detail>Try not to swallow any air with your food.</detail><detail>DO NOT chew gum or drink through a straw. Both will make you swallow air.</detail><detail>DO NOT eat cucumbers, radishes, sweets, or melons.</detail><detail>DO NOT drink beer or soda, or other carbonated drinks. </detail><text>Try eating 5 or 6 small meals a day.</text><detail>This will help keep you from getting too hungry.</detail><detail>Eat some solid foods before you drink anything if your stomach is empty. This may help decrease gurgling sounds.</detail><detail>Drink 6 to 8 cups (1.5 to 2 liters) of fluids every day. You can get dehydrated more easily if you have an ileostomy, so talk to your provider about the right amount of fluid for you.</detail><detail>Chew your food well. </detail><text>It is OK to try new foods, but try only 1 at a time. That way, if you have any trouble, you will know which food caused the problem.</text><text>Over-the-counter gas medicine can also help if you have too much gas.</text><text>Try not to gain weight unless you are underweight because of your surgery or any other illness. Excess weight is not healthy for you, and it may change how your ostomy works or fits.</text><text>When you feel sick to your stomach:</text><detail>Take small sips of water or tea.</detail><detail>Eat a soda cracker or a saltine. </detail><text>Some red foods may make you think you are bleeding.</text><detail>Tomato juice, cherry-flavored drinks, and cherry gelatin may make your stool reddish.</detail><detail>Red peppers, pimientos, and beets may show up as small red pieces in your stool or make your stool look red.</detail><detail>If you have eaten these, it is most likely OK if your stools look red. But, call your provider if the redness does not go away. </detail></h2><h2 title="When to Call the Doctor"><text>Call your provider if:</text><detail>Your stoma is swollen and is more than a half inch (1 centimeter) larger than normal.</detail><detail>Your stoma is pulling in, below the skin level.</detail><detail>Your stoma is bleeding more than normal.</detail><detail>Your stoma has turned purple, black, or white.</detail><detail>Your stoma is leaking often.</detail><detail>You have to change the appliance every day or two.</detail><detail>Your stoma does not seem to fit as well as it did before.</detail><detail>You have a skin rash, or the skin around your stoma is raw.</detail><detail>You have a discharge from the stoma that smells bad.</detail><detail>Your skin around your stoma is bulging out.</detail><detail>You have any kind of sore on the skin around your stoma.</detail><detail>You have any signs of being dehydrated (there is not enough water in your body).

<item><title>Ileostomy and your child</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000069.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>Your child had an injury or disease in their digestive system and needed an operation called an ileostomy. The operation changed the way your child's body gets rid of waste (stool, feces, or poop).</text><text>Now your child has an opening called a stoma in their belly. Waste will pass through the stoma into a pouch that collects it. You and your child will need to take care of the stoma and empty the pouch many times a day.</text></h2><h2 title="Introduction"><text>Seeing your child's ileostomy for the first time may be hard. Many parents feel guilty or that it is their fault when their children get ill and need this operation.</text><text>Parents also worry about how their child will be accepted now and later in life.</text><text>This is a difficult transition. But, if you are relaxed and positive about your child's ileostomy from the beginning, your child will have a much easier time with it. Talking with friends, family members, or a mental health counselor may help you.</text></h2><h2 title="Caring for Your Child's Ileostomy"><text>Your child will need help and support. Begin by having them help you empty and change their pouch. After time, older children will be able to gather supplies and change and empty their own pouch. Even a young child can learn to empty the pouch by themselves.</text><text>Be prepared for some trial and error in taking care of your child's ileostomy.</text></h2><h2 title="Possible Complications"><text>It is normal to have some problems with your child's ileostomy. Some common problems are:</text><detail>Your child may have trouble with some foods. Some foods lead to loose stools (diarrhea) and some can increase gas production. Talk to your health care provider about food choices that will help avoid these problems.</detail><detail>Your child may have skin problems near the ileostomy.</detail><detail>Your child's pouch may leak or get messy.</detail><text>Help your child understand how important it is to take good care of their ileostomy, and to clean up the bathroom after ileostomy care.</text></h2><h2 title="Living with an Ileostomy"><text>Children do not like to be different from their friends and classmates. Your child may have many difficult emotions, including frustration and embarrassment.</text><text>You may see some changes in your child's behavior at first. Sometimes teenagers have a harder time accepting their ileostomy than younger children. Try to keep a positive attitude and use humor when it fits the situation. You being open and natural will help your child's behavior stay positive.</text><text>Help your child learn how to handle problems with their ileostomy on their own.</text><text>Help your child decide who they want to talk to about their ileostomy. Talk with your child about what they will say. Be firm, calm, and open. It can help to do a role play, where you pretend you are one of the people your child has decided to tell about their ileostomy. Ask questions that person might ask. This will help your child prepare to talk with other people.</text><text>Your child should feel that you understand what it is like to have an ileostomy. Help them learn to take care of themselves, and let them know they will be able to live a full life.</text><text>When problems do happen, stay calm and ask for help from your child's provider.</text></h2><h2 title="Returning to School and Activities"><text>Be flexible with your child as they adjust to school and everyday situations.</text><text>When your child returns to school, have a plan to deal with problems or emergencies. If your child knows what to do when there is leakage, it will help them avoid embarrassing situations.</text><text>Your child should be able to take part in recess and sports, go camping and have other overnight trips, and do all other school and after-school activities.</text></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>Standard ileostomy and your child; Brooke ileostomy and your child; Continent ileostomy and your child; Abdominal pouch and your child; End ileostomy and your child; Ostomy and your child; Inflammatory bowel disease - ileostomy and your child; Crohn disease - ileostomy and your child; Ulcerative colitis - ileostomy and your child</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 12/9/2016"><text>Updated by: Michael M.

<item><title>Ileostomy - discharge</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000074.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>You had an injury or disease in your digestive system and needed an operation called an ileostomy. The operation changed the way your body gets rid of waste (feces).</text><text>Now you have an opening called a stoma in your belly. Waste will pass through the stoma into a pouch that collects it. You will need to take care of the stoma and empty the pouch many times a day.</text></h2><h2 title="What to Expect at Home"><text>Your stoma is made from the lining of your intestine. It will be pink or red, moist, and a little shiny.</text><text>Stool that comes from your ileostomy is thin or thick liquid, or it may be pasty. It is not solid like the stool that comes from your colon. Foods you eat, medicines you take, and other things may change how thin or thick your stool is.</text><text>Some amount of gas is normal.</text><text>You will need to empty the pouch 5 to 8 times a day.</text></h2><h2 title="Self-care "><text>Ask your health care provider what you should be eating when you are discharged from the hospital. You may be asked to follow a low-residue diet.</text><text>Talk with your provider if you have diabetes, heart disease, or any other condition, and you need to eat or avoid certain foods.</text><text>You may take a bath or a shower as air, soap, and water will not hurt your stoma and water will not go into the stoma. It is okay to do this with or without your pouch on.</text><text>Drugs and medicines:</text><detail>Liquid medicines may work better than solid ones. Take these when they are available.</detail><detail>Some drugs have a special (enteric) coating. Your body will not absorb these well. Ask your provider or pharmacist for other kinds of medicine. </detail><text>Talk with your provider if you are taking birth control pills. Your body may not absorb them well enough to keep you from getting pregnant.</text></h2><h2 title="Emptying and Cleaning Your Pouch"><text>It is best to empty your pouch when it is about one-third to one-half full. It is easier than when it is fuller, and there will be less odor.</text><text>To empty your pouch (remember -- stool may keep coming out of the stoma as you do this):</text><detail>Wear a clean pair of medical gloves.</detail><detail>Put some toilet paper in the toilet to keep splashing down. Or, you can flush as you empty the pouch to avoid splashing.</detail><detail>Sit far back on the seat or on one side of it. You can also stand or stoop over the toilet.</detail><detail>Hold the bottom of the pouch up.</detail><detail>Carefully roll the tail of your pouch over the toilet to empty it.</detail><detail>Clean the outside and inside of the pouch tail with toilet paper.</detail><detail>Close the pouch at the tail. </detail><text>Clean and rinse the inside and outside of the pouch.</text><detail>Your ostomy nurse may give you a special soap to use.</detail><detail>Ask your nurse about spraying nonstick oil inside the pouch to keep stool from sticking to it. </detail><text>You will also need to know about:</text><detail>Ileostomy -- changing your pouch</detail><detail>Ileostomy -- caring for your stoma</detail></h2><h2 title="Blockages"><text>Chew your foods well. This will help keep high-fiber foods from blocking your stoma.</text><text>Some signs of blockage are sudden cramping in your belly, a swollen stoma, nausea (with or without vomiting), and sudden increase of very watery output.</text><text>Drinking hot tea and other liquids may flush any foods that are blocking the stoma.</text><text>There will be times when nothing comes out of your ileostomy for a little while. This is normal.</text><text>Call your provider right away if your ileostomy bag stays empty longer than 4 to 6 hours. Your intestine may be blocked.</text><text>DO NOT just take a laxative if this problem happens.</text><text>Some foods that may block your stoma are raw pineapple, nuts and seeds, celery, popcorn, corn, dried fruits (such as raisins), mushrooms, chunky relishes, coconut, and some Chinese vegetables.</text><text>Tips for when no stool is coming from your stoma:</text><detail>Try loosening the opening of the pouch if you think it is too tight.</detail><detail>Change your position. Try holding your knees up to your chest.</detail><detail>Take a warm bath or warm shower. </detail></h2><h2 title="Loose Stools and Increased Output "><text>Some foods will loosen your stools and can increase output after you eat them. If you believe a certain food has caused a change in your stools, do not eat it for a while, and then try again. These foods may make your stools looser:</text><detail>Milk, fruit juice, and raw fruits and vegetables</detail><detail>Prune juice, licorice, large meals, spicy foods, beer, red wine, and chocolate </detail><text>Some foods will make your stool thicker. Some of these are applesauce, baked potatoes, rice, bread, peanut butter, pudding, and baked apples.</text><text>Drink 8 to 10 glasses of fluid a day. Drink more when it is hot or when you have been very active.</text><text>If you have diarrhea or your stools are looser or more watery:</text><detail>Drink extra fluids with electrolytes (sodium, potassium). Drinks such as Gatorade, PowerAde, or Pedialyte contain electrolytes. Drinking soda, milk, juice, or tea will help you get enough liquids.</detail><detail>Try to eat foods that have potassium and sodium every day to keep your potassium and sodium levels from getting too low. Some examples of foods that contain potassium are bananas. Some high-sodium foods are salted snacks.</detail><detail>Pretzels may help reduce water loss in stool. They also have extra sodium.</detail><detail>DO NOT wait to get help. Diarrhea can be dangerous. Call your provider if it does not go away. </detail></h2><h2 title="When to Call the Doctor"><text>Call your provider if:</text><detail>Your stoma is swelling and is more than a half inch (1 centimeter) larger than normal.</detail><detail>Your stoma is pulling in, below the skin level.</detail><detail>Your stoma is bleeding more than normal.</detail><detail>Your stoma has turned purple, black, or white.</detail><detail>Your stoma is leaking often.</detail><detail>Your stoma does not seem to fit as well as it did before.</detail><detail>You have a skin rash, or the skin around your stoma is raw.</detail><detail>You have a discharge from the stoma that smells bad.</detail><detail>Your skin around your stoma is pushing out.</detail><detail>You have any kind of sore on the skin around your stoma.</detail><detail>You have any signs of being dehydrated (there is not enough water in your body). Some signs are dry mouth, urinating less often, and feeling lightheaded or weak.</detail><detail>You have diarrhea that is not going away. </detail></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>Standard ileostomy - discharge; Brooke ileostomy - discharge; Continent ileostomy - discharge; Abdominal pouch - discharge; End ileostomy - discharge; Ostomy - discharge; Crohn's disease - ileostomy discharge; Inflammatory bowel disease - ileostomy discharge; Regional enteritis - ileostomy discharge; Ileitis - ileostomy discharge; Granulomatous ileocolitis - ileostomy discharge; IBD - ileostomy discharge; Ulcerative colitis - ileostomy discharge</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 7/22/2016"><text>Updated by: Subodh K.

The operation changed the way your body gets rid of waste (stool, feces, or poop).</text><text>Now you have an opening called a stoma in your belly. Waste will pass through the stoma into a pouch that collects it. You will need to take care of the stoma and empty the pouch many times a day.</text></h2><h2 title="When to Change Your Pouch"><text>Change your pouch every 5 to 8 days. If you have itching or leakage, change it right away.</text><text>If you have a pouch system made of 2 pieces (a pouch and a wafer) you can use 2 different pouches during the week. Wash and rinse the pouch not being used, and let it dry well.</text><text>Choose a time of day when there is less stool output from your stoma. Early in the morning before you eat or drink anything (or at least 1 hour after a meal) is best.</text><text>You may need to change your pouch more often if:</text><detail>You have been sweating more than usual from hot weather or exercise.</detail><detail>You have oily skin.</detail><detail>Your stool output is more watery than usual. </detail></h2><h2 title="Steps for Changing Your Pouch"><text>Wash your hands well and have all equipment ready. Put on a clean pair of medical gloves.</text><text>Gently remove the pouch. Push the skin away from the seal. DO NOT pull the ostomy away from your skin.</text><text>Wash your stoma and the skin around it carefully with soapy water.</text><detail>Use mild soap, such as Ivory, Safeguard, or Dial.</detail><detail>DO NOT use a soap that has perfume or lotion added to it.</detail><detail>Look carefully at your stoma and the skin around it for any changes. Allow your stoma to dry completely before connecting the new pouch. </detail><text>Trace the shape of your stoma onto the back of the new pouch and barrier or wafer (wafers are part of a 2-piece pouch system).</text><detail>Use a stoma guide with different sizes and shapes, if you have one.</detail><detail>Or, draw the shape of your stoma on a piece of paper. You may want to cut out your drawing and hold it up to your stoma to make sure it is the right size and shape. The edges of the opening should be close to the stoma, but they should not touch the stoma itself. </detail><text>Trace this shape onto the back of your new pouch or wafer. Then cut the wafer to the shape.</text><text>Use skin barrier powder or paste around the stoma, if your health care provider has recommended this.</text><detail>If the stoma is at or below the level of your skin, or if the skin around your stoma is uneven, using the paste will help seal it better.</detail><detail>The skin around your stoma should be dry and smooth. There should be no wrinkles in the skin around the stoma. </detail><text>Remove the backing from the pouch. Make sure the opening of the new pouch is centered over the stoma and pressed firmly onto your skin.</text><detail>Hold your hand over the pouch and barrier for about 30 seconds after you have placed it. This will help seal it better.</detail><detail>Ask your provider about using tape around the sides of the pouch or wafer to help seal them better. </detail><text>Fold the bag and secure it.</text></h2><h2 title="When to Call the Doctor"><text>Call your provider if:</text><detail>Your stoma is swelling and is more than a half inch (1 centimeter) larger than normal.</detail><detail>Your stoma is pulling in, below the skin level.</detail><detail>Your stoma is bleeding more than normal.</detail><detail>Your stoma has turned purple, black, or white.</detail><detail>Your stoma is leaking often.</detail><detail>Your stoma does not seem to fit as well as it did before.</detail><detail>You have to change the appliance every day or two.</detail><detail>You have a skin rash, or the skin around your stoma is raw.</detail><detail>You have a discharge from the stoma that smells bad.</detail><detail>Your skin around your stoma is pushing out.</detail><detail>You have any kind of sore on the skin around your stoma.</detail><detail>You have any signs of being dehydrated (there is not enough water in your body).

<item><title>Ileostomy - caring for your stoma</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000071.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>You had an injury or disease in your digestive system and needed an operation called an ileostomy. The operation changes the way your body gets rid of waste (stool, feces, or poop).</text><text>Now you have an opening called a stoma in your belly. Waste will pass through the stoma into a pouch that collects it. You will need to take care of your stoma and empty the pouch many times a day.</text></h2><h2 title="About Your Stoma"><text>Things to know about your stoma include:</text><detail>Your stoma is the lining of your intestine.</detail><detail>It will be pink or red, moist, and a little shiny.</detail><detail>Stomas are most often round or oval.</detail><detail>A stoma is very delicate.</detail><detail>Most stomas stick out a little over the skin, but some are flat.</detail><detail>You may see a little mucus. Your stoma may bleed a little when you clean it.</detail><detail>The skin around your stoma should be dry. </detail><text>The feces that come out of the stoma can be very irritating to the skin. So it is important to take special care of the stoma to avoid damage to the skin.</text></h2><h2 title="Stoma Care"><text>After surgery, the stoma will be swollen. It will shrink over the next several weeks.</text><text>The skin around your stoma should look like it did before surgery. The best way to protect your skin is by:</text><detail>Using a bag or pouch with the correct size opening, so waste does not leak</detail><detail>Taking good care of the skin around your stoma </detail><text>Stoma appliances are either 2-piece or 1-piece sets. A 2-piece set consists of a baseplate (or wafer) and pouch. A baseplate is the part that sticks to the skin and protects it against irritation from feces. The second piece is the pouch that feces empty into. The pouch attaches to the baseplate, similar to a Tupperware cover. In a 1-piece set, the baseplate and appliance is all one piece. The baseplate usually needs to be changed only once or twice a week.</text><text>To care for your skin:</text><detail>Wash your skin with warm water and dry it well before you attach the pouch.</detail><detail>Avoid skin care products that contain alcohol. These can make your skin too dry.</detail><detail>DO NOT use products that contain oil on the skin around your stoma. Doing so can make it hard to attach the pouch to your skin.</detail><detail>Use fewer, special skin care products to make skin problems less likely. </detail><text>If you have hair on the skin around your stoma, your pouch may not stick. Removing the hair may help.</text><detail>Ask your ostomy nurse about the best way to shave the area.</detail><detail>If you use a safety razor and soap or shaving cream, be sure to rinse your skin well after you shave the area.</detail><detail>You can also use trimming scissors, electric shaver, or have laser treatment to remove the hair.</detail><detail>DO NOT use a straight edge.</detail><detail>Be careful to protect your stoma if you remove the hair around it. </detail><text>Carefully look at your stoma and the skin around it every time you change your pouch or barrier. If the skin around your stoma is red or wet, your pouch may not be sealed well on your stoma.</text><text>Sometimes the adhesive, skin barrier, paste, tape, or pouch may damage the skin. This may happen when you first start using a stoma, or it may happen after you have been using it for months, or even years.</text><text>If this happens:</text><detail>Ask your health care provider about medicine to treat your skin.</detail><detail>Call your provider if it is does not get better when you treat it. </detail><text>If your stoma is leaking, your skin will get sore.</text><text>Be sure to treat any skin redness or skin changes right away, when the problem is still small. DO NOT allow the sore area to become larger or more irritated before asking your doctor about it.</text><text>If your stoma becomes longer than usual (sticks out from the skin more), try a cold compress, like ice wrapped in a towel, to make it go in.</text><text>You should never stick anything into your stoma, unless your doctor tells you to.</text></h2><h2 title="When to Call the Doctor"><text>Call your provider if:</text><detail>Your stoma is swollen and is more than a 1/2 inch (1 cm) larger than normal.</detail><detail>Your stoma is pulling in, below the skin level.</detail><detail>Your stoma is bleeding more than normal.</detail><detail>Your stoma has turned purple, black, or white.</detail><detail>Your stoma is leaking often or draining fluid.</detail><detail>Your stoma does not seem to fit as well as it did before.</detail><detail>You have to change the appliance once every day or two.</detail><detail>You have a discharge from the stoma that smells bad.</detail><detail>You have any signs of being dehydrated (there is not enough water in your body).

<item><title>Kegel exercises - self-care</title><url>https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000141.htm</url><h2 title="summary"><text>Kegel exercises can help make the muscles under the uterus, bladder, and bowel (large intestine) stronger. They can help both men and women who have problems with urine leakage or bowel control. You may have these problems:</text><detail>As you get older</detail><detail>If you gain weight</detail><detail>After pregnancy and childbirth</detail><detail>After gynecologic surgery (women)</detail><detail>After prostate surgery (men)</detail><text>People who have brain and nerve disorders may also have problems with urine leakage or bowel control.</text><text>Kegel exercises can be done any time you are sitting or lying down. You can do them when you are eating, sitting at your desk, driving, and when you are resting or watching television.</text></h2><h2 title="How to Find the Right Muscles "><text>A Kegel exercise is like pretending you have to urinate and then holding it. You relax and tighten the muscles that control urine flow. It is important to find the right muscles to tighten.</text><text>Next time you have to urinate, start to go and then stop. Feel the muscles in your vagina (for women), bladder, or anus get tight and move up. These are the pelvic floor muscles. If you feel them tighten, you have done the exercise right. Your thighs, buttock muscles, and abdomen should remain relaxed. </text><text>If you still are not sure you are tightening the right muscles:</text><detail>Imagine that you are trying to keep yourself from passing gas.</detail><detail>Women: Insert a finger into your vagina. Tighten the muscles as if you are holding in your urine, then let go. You should feel the muscles tighten and move up and down.</detail><detail>Men: Insert a finger into your rectum. Tighten the muscles as if you are holding in your urine, then let go. You should feel the muscles tighten and move up and down. </detail></h2><h2 title="How to do Kegel Exercises "><text>Once you know what the movement feels like, do Kegel exercises 3 times a day:</text><detail>Make sure your bladder is empty, then sit or lie down.</detail><detail>Tighten your pelvic floor muscles. Hold tight and count to 8.</detail><detail>Relax the muscles and count to 10.</detail><detail>Repeat 10 times, 3 times a day (morning, afternoon, and night). </detail><text>Breathe deeply and relax your body when you are doing these exercises. Make sure you are not tightening your stomach, thigh, buttock, or chest muscles.</text><text>After 4 to 6 weeks, you should feel better and have fewer symptoms. Keep doing the exercises, but do not increase how many you do. Overdoing it can lead to straining when you urinate or move your bowels.</text><text>Some notes of caution:</text><detail>Once you learn how to do them, do not practice Kegel exercises at the same time you are urinating more than twice a month. Doing the exercises while you are urinating can weaken your pelvic floor muscles over time or cause damage to bladder and kidneys.</detail><detail>In women, doing Kegel exercises incorrectly or with too much force may cause vaginal muscles to tighten too much. This can cause pain during sexual intercourse.</detail><detail>Incontinence will return if you stop doing these exercises. Once you start doing them, you may need to do them for the rest of your life.</detail><detail>It may take several months for your incontinence to lessen once you start doing these exercises. </detail></h2><h2 title="When to Call the Doctor"><text>Call your health care provider if you are not sure you are doing Kegel exercises the right way. Your provider can check to see if you are doing them correctly.You may be referred to a physical therapist who specializes in pelvic floor exercises.</text></h2><h2 title="Alternative Names"><text>Pelvic muscle strengthening exercises; Pelvic floor exercises</text></h2><h2 title="Review Date 2/21/2017"><text>Updated by: Jennifer Sobol, DO, Urologist with the Michigan Institute of Urology, West Bloomfield, MI.

Ask the pharmacist to help you pick out an organizer that will work best for you.</text><text>Things to think about when choosing a pill organizer:</text><detail>The number of days, such as 7, 14, or 28-day size.</detail><detail>The number of compartments for each day, such as 1, 2, 3, or 4 compartments.</detail><detail>For example, if you take medicine 4 times each day, you can use a 7-day pill organizer with 4 compartments for each day (morning, noon, evening, and bedtime). Fill the pill organizer to last 7 days. Some pill organizers let you snap out one day's worth of pills. You can carry this with you if you are out all day. You can also use a different 7-day pill organizer for the 4 times of the day. Label each one with the time of day. </detail><text>USE AN AUTOMATIC PILL DISPENSER</text><text>You can buy an automatic pill dispenser online.

This can be a problem if you are going out. </detail><text>USE COLOR MARKS ON YOUR MEDICINE BOTTLES</text><text>Use a color marker to label your medicines by the time of day that you take them. For example:</text><detail>Put a green mark on bottles of medicines that you take at breakfast.</detail><detail>Put a red mark on bottles of medicines that you take at lunch.</detail><detail>Put a blue mark on bottles of medicines that you take at dinner.</detail><detail>Put an orange mark on bottles of medicines that you take at bedtime. </detail><text>CREATE A MEDICINE RECORD</text><text>List the medicine, what time you take it, and leave a place to check off when you take each medicine.</text></h2><h2 title="Know Your Medicines"><text>Put on the list any prescription medicines, over-the-counter drugs, and vitamins, herbs, and supplements that you take. Include the:</text><detail>Name of the medicine</detail><detail>Description of what it does</detail><detail>Dose</detail><detail>Times of day you take it</detail><detail>Side effects </detail></h2><h2 title="Use a Regular Doctor and Pharmacist"><text>Bring the list and your medicines in their bottles to your doctor appointments and when you go to the pharmacy.</text><detail>When you know your doctor and your pharmacist, you will find it easier to talk to them. You want good communication about your medicines.</detail><detail>Review your drug list with your doctor or pharmacist.</detail><detail>Ask if there are any problems with taking any of your medicines together.</detail><detail>Know what to do if you miss your dose. Most of the time, you move on and take the next dose when it is due. DO NOT take a double dose. Check with your doctor or pharmacist. </detail></h2><h2 title="When to Call the Doctor"><text>Call the doctor when you are:</text><detail>Not sure what to do if you missed or forgot your medicine.</detail><detail>Having trouble remembering to take your medicine.</detail><detail>Having trouble taking a lot of medicine.
